      Backdoors are powerful attacks against deep neural networks (DNNs). By poisoning training data, attackers can inject hidden rules (backdoors) into DNNs, which only activate on inputs containing attack-specific triggers. While existing work has studied backdoor attacks on a variety of DNN models, they only consider static models, which remain unchanged after initial deployment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this paper, we study the impact of backdoor attacks on a more realistic scenario of time-varying DNN models, where model weights are updated periodically to handle drifts in data distribution over time. Specifically, we empirically quantify the "survivability" of a backdoor against model updates, and examine how attack parameters, data drift behaviors, and model update strategies affect backdoor survivability. Our results show that one-shot backdoor attacks (i.e., only poisoning training data once) do not survive past a few model updates, even when attackers aggressively increase trigger size and poison ratio. To stay unaffected by model update, attackers must continuously introduce corrupted data into the training pipeline. Together, these results indicate that when models are updated to learn new data, they also "forget" backdoors as hidden, malicious features. The larger the distribution shift between old and new training data, the faster backdoors are forgotten. Leveraging these insights, we apply a smart learning rate scheduler to further accelerate backdoor forgetting during model updates, which prevents one-shot backdoors from surviving past a single model update.

      Machine learning abilities have become a vital component for various solutions across industries, applications, and sectors. Many organizations seek to leverage AI-based solutions across their business services to unlock better efficiency and increase productivity. Problems, however, can arise if there is a lack of quality data for AI-model training, scalability, and maintenance. We propose a data-centric federated learning architecture leveraged by a public blockchain and smart contracts to overcome this significant issue. Our proposed solution provides a virtual public marketplace where developers, data scientists, and AI-engineer can publish their models and collaboratively create and access quality data for training. We enhance data quality and integrity through an incentive mechanism that rewards contributors for data contribution and verification. Those combined with the proposed framework helped increase with only one user simulation the training dataset with an average of 100 input daily and the model accuracy by approximately 4\%.

      Deep neural network based face recognition models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. However, many of the past attacks require the adversary to solve an input-dependent optimization problem using gradient descent which makes the attack impractical in real-time. These adversarial examples are also tightly coupled to the attacked model and are not as successful in transferring to different models. In this work, we propose ReFace, a real-time, highly-transferable attack on face recognition models based on Adversarial Transformation Networks (ATNs). ATNs model adversarial example generation as a feed-forward neural network. We find that the white-box attack success rate of a pure U-Net ATN falls substantially short of gradient-based attacks like PGD on large face recognition datasets. We therefore propose a new architecture for ATNs that closes this gap while maintaining a 10000x speedup over PGD. Furthermore, we find that at a given perturbation magnitude, our ATN adversarial perturbations are more effective in transferring to new face recognition models than PGD. ReFace attacks can successfully deceive commercial face recognition services in a transfer attack setting and reduce face identification accuracy from 82% to 16.4% for AWS SearchFaces API and Azure face verification accuracy from 91% to 50.1%.

      Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a new distributed method for identity management, commonly used to address the problem that users are lack of control over their identities. However, the excessive pursuit of self-sovereignty in the most existing SSI schemes hinders sanctions against attackers. To deal with the malicious behavior, a few SSI schemes introduce accountability mechanisms, but they sacrifice users' privacy. What's more, the digital identities (static strings or updatable chains) in the existing SSI schemes are as inputs to a third-party executable program (mobile app, smart contract, etc.) to achieve identity reading, storing and proving, users' self-sovereignty are weakened. To solve the above problems, we present a new self-sovereign identity scheme to strike a balance between privacy and accountability and get rid of the dependence on the third-party program. In our scheme, one and only individual-specific executable code is generated as a digital avatar-i for each human to interact with others in cyberspace without a third-party program, in which the embedding of biometrics enhances uniqueness and user control over their identity. In addition, a joint accountability mechanism, which is based on the shamir (t, n) threshold algorithm and a consortium blockchain, is designed to restrict the power of each regulatory authority and protect users' privacy. Finally, we analyze the security, SSI properties and conduct detailed experiments in term of the cost of computation, storage and blockchain gas. The analysis results indicate that our scheme resists the known attacks and fulfills all the six SSI properties. Compared with the state-of-the-art schemes, the extensive experiment results show that the cost is larger in server storage, blockchain storage and blockchain gas, but is still low enough for practical situations.

      Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great power in learning node representations on graphs. However, they may inherit historical prejudices from training data, leading to discriminatory bias in predictions. Although some work has developed fair GNNs, most of them directly borrow fair representation learning techniques from non-graph domains without considering the potential problem of sensitive attribute leakage caused by feature propagation in GNNs. However, we empirically observe that feature propagation could vary the correlation of previously innocuous non-sensitive features to the sensitive ones. This can be viewed as a leakage of sensitive information which could further exacerbate discrimination in predictions. Thus, we design two feature masking strategies according to feature correlations to highlight the importance of considering feature propagation and correlation variation in alleviating discrimination. Motivated by our analysis, we propose Fair View Graph Neural Network (FairVGNN) to generate fair views of features by automatically identifying and masking sensitive-correlated features considering correlation variation after feature propagation. Given the learned fair views, we adaptively clamp weights of the encoder to avoid using sensitive-related features. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FairVGNN enjoys a better trade-off between model utility and fairness. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/YuWVandy/FairVGNN.

<p>
      With the loss of a large number of space vectors under switch open-circuit faults, the neutral point potential (NPP) control of T-type three-level converters is faced with a huge challenge. It becomes harsh to balance the NPP and maintain the symmetry of line voltages under switch open-circuit faults simultaneously. In order to improve the NPP control performance and stable operation of T-type three-level converters, this article presents a hybrid modulation strategy that can enhance the NPP control ability even under switch open-circuit faults. Through a carrier-based analysis tool, two candidate modulation strategies are first evaluated from the perspective of the adjustment range of the neutral point current. The first one maintains the conventional three-level modulation in two nonfault phase arms. The second one degrades the mode of modulation from three-level modulation to two-level modulation in two nonfault phase arms. By making full use of the NPP oscillation characteristics of the two candidate methods, a hybrid modulation strategy based on transition duty-cycle and enabled bridge-arm adjustment is put forward to achieve a comprehensive optimal control performance. Numerical analysis and experiments are carried on to prove the correctness and feasibility of the proposed method.

<p>
      An improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on Gaussian distribution model is proposed to realize the autotuning of weighting factors for the cost function design in the model predictive control method. First, the design principle of the weighting factors in model predictive torque control for permanent magnet synchronous motor system is analyzed. Then, using the root mean square of the current error in the two-phase rotating coordinate system and the system switching frequency as references, the objective function of the particles in the PSO is designed by considering the main control goals of reducing the torque ripple, the current total harmonic distortion, and the switching frequency. The Gaussian individual optimal distribution model is used to update the particle position on the structure of the conventional PSO algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method can solve the problem of weighting factors design as it reduces the switching frequency of the system while achieving excellent steady-state performance.

<p>
      In this article, a fully soft switched interleaved bidirectional buck/boost converter with high voltage conversion ratio (VCR) and no pulsating current at low voltage source is proposed. Winding cross-coupled inductors technique is employed in order to increase VCR and mitigate current ripple at low voltage side. Moreover, soft switching conditions for all semiconductor devices are provided and the leakage inductances energy of coupled inductors are absorbed in both high step-up/down operating modes. Furthermore, the reverse recovery problem of all diodes is removed due to zero current switching turn off. All the mentioned advantages are achieved for a bidirectional converter with two interleaved phases in both high step-up/down operating modes by only one clamp circuit consisting of a clamp capacitor and two active switches. Also, the body diodes of the main switches are utilized as the main diodes to reduce the element count. The converter performance is validated by theoretical analysis and an 800 W prototype circuit in both operating modes.

      Due to a short-time gap breakdown in electrical discharge machining (EDM), a high dynamic response and flexible discharge current control ability are required for a pulse power generator. Therefore, a one-cycle control(OCC) of output current for a buck-type EDM pulse power generator is proposed. Considering the inductor current operating state, a full-range OCC current control is presented, and the Taylor expansion method is used for the duty cycle calculation. A duty cycle optimization strategy is proposed for transient states. Based on the small signal modeling, the dynamic response ability of the system is analyzed. The discharge current can switch from many transient states to a steady state in a few switching cycles without a current overshoot, and follow the average current reference well in the steady state.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      The wide bandwidth impedance of grid and inverter are the critical parameters for small-signal stability analysis and control optimization of grid-tied inverter systems. The impedance measurement is an effective way to obtain the grid and inverter impedance by injecting a series of perturbations into the measured system. However, previous studies fail to fully consider the adverse grid voltage conditions; including harmonics, unbalance, frequency deviation, voltage sag, and phase jump; which may bring errors to the measured impedance. In this article, a cascaded delayed signal cancellation (CDSC)-based method is proposed to accurately obtain the impedance of the measured system under adverse grid voltage conditions. The proposed CDSC-based method is mainly composed of the perturbation extraction module (PEM) and frequency adaptive module (FAM). Different CDSC blocks are applied to implement the PEM and FAM to extract the injected perturbations adaptively, under various adverse grid voltage conditions. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiment results are presented to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed impedance measurement method.

      <p>
        Governments rely on citizen compliance for official rules to be effective. Yet achieving compliance is often tricky, particular when individual costs are high. Under what conditions will citizens voluntarily respect collective rules? We explore public compliance with SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus) restrictions, focusing on the role of political trust. We anticipate that the effects of trust on compliance will be conditional on the presence of other factors, notably fear of infection. Low levels of fear may provide room for trust to shape compliance; yet high levels of fear may &#8216;crowd out&#8217; the role of trust. We hypothesize that, at the pandemic&#8217;s outset, compliance was likely to be shaped more by fear than by trust. Yet as the pandemic progressed, the impact of fear on compliance was likely to have weakened, and the impact of trust to have strengthened. These hypotheses are tested using longitudinal data from Austria, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

      <p>
        Little is known about whether and under which conditions populist radical right parties&#8217; (PRRPs&#8217;) nativist welfare politics matters to the voters. I address this gap in the research and test the argument that the electoral appeal of this electoral discourse varies among welfare regimes. The study compares the conservative and social-democratic welfare regimes and focuses on the vote choices of the two core constituencies of PRRPs &#8211; economically exposed and immigration-sceptic voters. The results show that these electorates support PRRPs&#8217; nativist welfare positions for very different reasons in the two welfare regimes. First, in the conservative regime, economically exposed citizens vote for PRRPs, the more they stress nativism and welfare expansion. By contrast, in the social-democratic regime this group of voters is more likely to support positions combining nativism and dismantled welfare benefits. Second, immigrant-sceptic voters in the social-democratic regime support PRRPs who pledge to preserve the welfare state, and increased migration considerably boosts the probability that they do so. By contrast, this group of voters in the conservative regime is more likely to support PRRPs who seek to partly dismantle the welfare state, and the inflow of immigrants is unrelated to these choices. These results have important implications and suggest that welfare regimes moderate public opinion differently in the current age of populism compared to previous eras.

<div class="abstract">
      <p>
        How do coalitional dynamics matter for the capacity of states to maintain social inclusion in coordinated models of capitalism? Taking its departure in scholarship emphasizing the influence of employers on the extent of state intervention in post-industrial economies, this paper argues that employer influence depends on which actors they team up with &#8211; unions or parties. If unions depend on employers for their organizational influence in a policy field, unions become a strong coalitional partner for employers in weakening demands for inclusiveness from the parliamentary arena. Conversely, if unions have influence independent of any coalition with employers, both unions and employers are likely to team up with political parties aligned with their preferences. This makes the level of inclusion resulting from increased state intervention more fluctuating, depending on who holds government power. A comparative study of reforms of Danish and Austrian vocational education institutions corroborates the empirical purchase of the argument.

<div class="abstract">
      <p>
        While there has been a veritable boom in literature on organized interests, their lobbying strategies, relationships with decision-makers, and their impact on policymaking, only a few studies have explored internal organizational developments and, specifically, the professionalization of interest groups. The present study focuses on the national and transnational factors driving the professionalization of interest groups in Central and Eastern Europe, a region previously neglected in much of the interest group literature. Based on a sample of more than 400 surveyed organizations operating in Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovenia in the healthcare, higher education, and energy sectors, we explore three bundles of factors potentially enhancing the professionalization of interest groups &#8211; organizational funding sources, national and transnational intergroup cooperation and organizations&#8217; standing in the domestic interest group system. Our statistical analyses show that state subsidies and tight policy coordination with the state are crucial drivers of internal organizational professionalization, suggesting rather patronistic and symbiotic relationships between the state and certain organizations. However, our data also support the notion that interorganizational collaboration, both at the national and international levels, may also be key to organizational professionalization, enabling groups that lack close ties with the state to compensate their disadvantage with intensive domestic and international networking. The study is also among the first to link increasing professionalization with organizational population density.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      Zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR) has attracted great attention recently, due to the potential application of sketch-based retrieval under zero-shot scenarios, where the categories of query sketches and gallery photos are not observed in the training stage. However, it is still under insufficient exploration for the general and practical scenario when the query sketches and gallery photos contain both seen and unseen categories. Such a problem is defined as generalized zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (GZS-SBIR), which is the focus of this work. To this end, we propose a novel Augmented Multi-modality Fusion (AMF) framework to generalize seen concepts to unobserved ones efficiently. Specifically, a novel knowledge discovery module named cross-domain augmentation is designed in both visual and semantic space to mimic novel knowledge unseen from the training stage, which is the key to handling the GZS-SBIR challenge. Moreover, a triplet domain alignment module is proposed to couple the cross-domain distribution between photo and sketch in visual space. To enhance the robustness of our model, we explore embedding propagation to refine both visual and semantic features by removing undesired noise. Eventually, visual-semantic fusion representations are concatenated for further domain discrimination and task-specific recognition, which tend to trigger the cross-domain alignment in both visual and semantic feature space. Experimental evaluations are conducted on popular ZS-SBIR benchmarks as well as a new evaluation protocol designed for GZS-SBIR from DomainNet dataset with more diverse sub-domains, and the promising results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution over other baselines. The source code is available at https://github.com/scottjingtt/AMF_GZS_SBIR.git.

      To the Editor In an updated Recommendation Statement, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) in asymptomatic patients aged 50 years or older. When deciding whether to screen patients for AF, we encourage clinicians to consider the potential effect of subclinical AF on minoritized populations, including racial and ethnic minoritized groups such as American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, and Hispanic or Latino populations.

</p>

<p>
      A milling cutter is one of the most important parts of machine tools. Its working status significantly influences the precision of workpiece. Due to the complex wear mechanism, the single sensor may be difficult to acquire the complete degradation information of milling cutters. Therefore, in this article, a feature learning based method is proposed to automatically extract features from multisource data and predict the remaining useful life of cutting tools in real time. First, a statistic-based method is constructed to detect and delete the outliers hidden in the monitoring data. Second, the clean data are input into a multiscale convolutional attention network (MSAN) to learn features and fuse multisource data. At last, the fused data are used to predict the remaining useful life of cutting tools in a regression layer. Compared with traditional tool life prediction methods, the proposed method is able to fuse multisource data through an attention feature learning model to conduct the life prediction of tools. Additionally, the data cleaning and model optimization methods are also proposed to promote engineering practicability. To validate the effectiveness of such method, the life testing experiments on milling cutters are conducted to obtain run-to-failure data. In those experiments, multisensor monitor data are acquired, which are used to conduct validation experiments testing the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results indicate the superiority of the proposed method in remaining useful life prediction milling cutters.

      The power produced by a wind turbine depends on environmental conditions, working parameters, and interactions with nearby turbines. However, these aspects are often neglected in the design of data-driven models for wind farms&#8217; performance analysis. In this article, we propose to predict the active power and to provide reliable prediction intervals via ensembles of multivariate polynomial regression models that exploit a higher number of inputs (compared to most approaches in the literature), including operational and thermal variables. We present two main strategies: the former considers the environmental measurements collected at the other wind turbines in the farm as additional modeling information for the turbine under analysis; the latter combines multiple models relative to different operative conditions. We validate our approach on real data from the SCADA system of a wind farm in Italy and obtain a MAE of the order of 1.0% of the rated power of the turbine. Moreover, due to the structure of our approach, we can gain quantitative insights on the covariates most frequently selected depending on the working region of the wind turbines.

      In the context of Industry 5.0, in this article, we study the cyber&#8211;physical&#8211;social systems in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based on the task background of transmission line project acceptance. First, based on the idea of a parallel system, a parallel UAV planning system for transmission line project acceptance tasks is developed. The mathematical model based on swarm intelligence is then constructed from the multidimensional perspective of improving the acceptance efficiency, shortening the acceptance time, and reducing the energy consumption. This is done based on the physical system data while considering the constraints of UAVs in performing acceptance tasks. Experiments are simulated based on the actual environment data of the quality supervision and acceptance of a 500 kV transmission line project in a plateau area before it is put into production. The obtained results are compared with those of other similar cutting-edge algorithms. The efficiency and practicality of the proposed artificial parallel planning system are finally verified.

      Integrated around 2004, the concept of Energy Internet (EI) could provide new windows for the industrial power system society by incorporating the features of physical systems and cyber systems simultaneously. Technically, physical systems like electricity generation resources must be controlled and managed according to the instructions received from the cyber-systems. Being equipped by the smart grid and the internet idea, the EI can yield significant benefits such as higher reliability, improved power quality and mitigated the cost and losses. In the EI structure, the multiway flow of information and communication is monitored and controlled by the widespread and heterogeneous devices including the energy router, smart meters, etc. These technologies and devices bring many security concerns for the EI. Moreover, there are emerging concerns over the way to control, predict, manage, combine, and coordinate the energy resources in the EI. However, there exist many challenges that should be investigating and addressing before formal adoption of EI in industrial power and energy systems. To this end, this special issue invites the authors from both industry and academia to submit original research works on EI challenges in the power system.

      Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) is an emerging secure distributed learning paradigm that aggregates user-trained local gradients into a federated model through a cryptographic protocol. Unfortunately, PPFL is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks launched by a Byzantine adversary, who crafts malicious local gradients to harm the accuracy of the federated model. To resist model poisoning attacks, existing defense strategies focus on identifying suspicious local gradients over plaintexts. However, the Byzantine adversary submits encrypted poisonous gradients to circumvent existing defense strategies in PPFL, resulting in encrypted model poisoning. To address the issue, in this paper we design a privacy-preserving defense strategy using two-trapdoor homomorphic encryption (referred to as ShieldFL), which can resist encrypted model poisoning without compromising privacy in PPFL. Specially, we first present the secure cosine similarity method aiming to measure the distance between two encrypted gradients. Then, we propose the Byzantine-tolerance aggregation using cosine similarity, which can achieve robustness for both Independently Identically Distribution (IID) and non-IID data. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets (i.e., MNIST, KDDCup99, and Amazon) show that ShieldFL outperforms existing defense strategies. Especially, ShieldFL can achieve 30%-80% accuracy improvement to defend two state-of-the-art model poisoning attacks in both non-IID and IID settings.

      When public clouds become the platform of choice for MapReduce processing, users are placing higher demands on the privacy of the job data and program. A number of solutions employed trusted hardware to protect MapReduce tasks. However, existing works pointed out that simply protecting individual nodes in the MapReduce cluster with trusted hardware and protecting cross-node communication with encryption still leak information from side-channels. Specifically, attackers can derive data information by observing and manipulating cross-node communication traffic volumes. Although existing works proposed some solutions to prevent such leakage, in this paper, we show that previous solutions still leak critical job information. Additionally, our study shows that previous solutions have limitations from other aspects, including data restriction, partition function restriction, reliability issue, and high overheads. To address all the discovered limitations, we introduced the Strong Shuffle solution. Our analysis and experimental results showed that our solution has reduced the information leakage and addressed other discovered limitations. To support Strong Shuffle, we proposed a variant Bloom Filter, named Group-based Dynamic Bloom Filter (GDBF). Our theoretical analysis showed that GDBF has lower performance and storage overhead than the traditional Scalable Bloom Filter.

      Cloud storage is more and more prevalent in practice, and thus how to check its integrity becomes increasingly essential. A classical solution is identity-based (ID-based) provable data possession (PDP), which supports certificateless cloud storage auditing without entire user data. However, existing ID-PDP protocols always require that cloud users outsource data blocks, authenticators and a small-sized file tag to the cloud, and make use of the heavy elliptic curve cryptography over bilinear pairing. These disadvantages would result in vast storage, communication, and computation costs, which is unexpected, especially for resource-limited cloud users. To improve the performance, this paper proposes a novel cryptographic primitive: ID-based PDP with compressed cloud storage. In this model, cloud storage auditing can be achieved by using only encrypted data blocks in a self-verified way, and original data blocks can be reconstructed from the outsourced data. Thus, data owners no longer need to store original data blocks on the cloud. We also use some basic algebraic operations to realize a concrete ID-based PDP protocol with compressed cloud storage, which is quite efficient due to no heavy cryptographic operations involved. The proposed protocol can easily be extended to support the other practical functions by using the primitive replacement technique. The proposed protocol is strictly proven to have the properties of correctness, privacy, unforgeability and detectability. Finally, we give plenty of theoretical analysis and experimental results to validate the efficiency of the proposed protocol.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">

      It has been widely observed that deep neural networks are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. Decision-based attacks could generate adversarial examples based solely on top-1 labels returned by the target model. However, they typically make excessive queries and could not bypass detection effectively. To comprehensively assess a decision-based attack, besides its query efficiency, the performance against detection is also a concern. Considering that previous detections consume massive resources and always mistakenly recognize benign video frames as malicious attacks, we design a lightweight detection called boundary detection to overcome the above limitations, whose success reveals serious limitations of existing decision-based attacks. To develop more powerful attacks, we first present f-mixup as a basic method to produce candidate adversarial examples in the frequency domain. Using f-mixup as the building block, we propose f-attack as a complete decision-based attack. With the help of several natural images, f-attack could both work well with limited (hundreds of) queries and bypass detection effectively. Nevertheless, if the attacker could make relatively adequate (thousands of) queries and the target model is not equipped with detection, f-attack will lag behind existing decision-based attacks. We additionally introduce frequency binary search based on f-mixup, which serves as a plug-and-play module for existing decision-based attacks to further improve their query efficiency. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      Semi-supervised few-shot learning aims to improve the model generalization ability by means of both limited labeled data and widely-available unlabeled data. Previous works attempt to model the relations between the few-shot labeled data and extra unlabeled data, by performing a label propagation or pseudo-labeling process using an episodic training strategy. However, the feature distribution represented by the pseudo-labeled data itself is coarse-grained, meaning that there might be a large distribution gap between the pseudo-labeled data and the real query data. To this end, we propose a sample-centric feature generation (SFG) approach for semi-supervised few-shot image classification. Specifically, the few-shot labeled samples from different classes are initially trained to predict pseudo-labels for the potential unlabeled samples. Next, a semi-supervised meta-generator is utilized to produce derivative features centering around each pseudo-labeled sample, enriching the intra-class feature diversity. Meanwhile, the sample-centric generation constrains the generated features to be compact and close to the pseudo-labeled sample, ensuring the inter-class feature discriminability. Further, a reliability assessment (RA) metric is developed to weaken the influence of generated outliers on model learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed feature generation approach on challenging one- and few-shot image classification benchmarks.

</p>

      It is crucial to protect users&#8217; location traces against inference attacks on aggregate mobility data collected from multiple users in various real-world applications. Most of the existing works on aggregate mobility data are focusing on inference attacks rather than designing privacy-preserving release mechanisms, and a few differential private release mechanisms suffer from poor utility-privacy tradeoffs. In this paper, we propose optimal centralized privacy-preserving aggregate mobility data release mechanisms (PAMDRMs) that minimize the leakage from an information-theoretic perspective by releasing perturbed versions of the raw aggregate location. Specifically, we use mutual information to measure user-level and aggregate-level privacy leakage separately, and formulate leakage minimization problems under utility constraints. As directly solving the optimization problems incur exponential complexity w.r.t. users&#8217; trace length, we transform them into belief state Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), with a focus on the MDP formulation for the user-level privacy problem. We build reinforcement learning (RL) models and leverage the efficient Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic RL algorithm to derive the solutions to the MDPs as our optimal PAMDRMs. We compare them with two state-of-the-art privacy protection mechanisms PDPR (context-aware local design) and DMLM (context-free centralized design) in terms of mutual information leakage and adversary&#8217;s attack success (evaluated by her expected estimation error and Jensen-Shannon Divergence-based error). Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the user-level PAMDRM performs the best on both measures thanks to its context-aware property and centralized design. Even though the aggregate-level PAMDRM achieves better privacy-utility tradeoff than the other two, it does not always perform better than them on adversarial suc- ess, highlighting the necessity of considering privacy measures from different perspectives to avoid overestimating the level of privacy offered to users. Lastly, we discuss an alternative, fully data-driven approach to derive the optimal PAMDRM by leveraging adversarial training on limited data samples.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      Recent studies have pointed out that many well-developed Visual Question Answering (VQA) models are heavily affected by the language prior problem. It refers to making predictions based on the co-occurrence pattern between textual questions and answers instead of reasoning upon visual contents. To tackle this problem, most existing methods focus on strengthening the visual feature learning capability to reduce this text shortcut influence on model decisions. However, few efforts have been devoted to analyzing its inherent cause and providing an explicit interpretation. It thus lacks a good guidance for the research community to move forward in a purposeful way, resulting in model construction perplexity towards overcoming this non-trivial problem. In this paper, we propose to interpret the language prior problem in VQA from a class-imbalance view. Concretely, we design a novel interpretation scheme whereby the loss of mis-predicted frequent and sparse answers from the same question type is distinctly exhibited during the late training phase. It explicitly reveals why the VQA model tends to produce a frequent yet obviously wrong answer, to a given question whose right answer is sparse in the training set. Based upon this observation, we further propose a novel loss re-scaling approach to assign different weights to each answer according to the training data statistics for estimating the final loss. We apply our approach into six strong baselines and the experimental results on two VQA-CP benchmark datasets evidently demonstrate its effectiveness. In addition, we also justify the validity of the class imbalance interpretation scheme on other computer vision tasks, such as face recognition and image classification.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">

      The cross-domain image captioning, which is trained on a source domain and generalized to other domains, usually faces the large domain shift problem. Although prior work has attempted to leverage both paired source and unpaired target data to minimize this shift, the performance is still unsatisfactory. One main reason lies in the large discrepancy in language expression between two domains, where diverse language styles are adopted to describe an image from different views, resulting in different semantic descriptions for an image. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a Style-based Cross-domain Image Captioner (SCIC) which incorporates the discriminative style information into the encoder-decoder framework, and interprets an image as a special sentence according to external style instructions. Technically, we design a novel &#8220;Instruction-based LSTM&#8221;, which adds the instruct gate to collect a style instruction, and then outputs a specified format according to that instruction. Two objectives are designed to train I-LSTM: 1) generating correct image descriptions and 2) generating correct styles, thus the model is expected to accurately capture the semantic meanings of an image by the special caption as well as understand the syntactic structure of the caption. We use MS-COCO as the source domain, and Oxford-102, CUB-200, Flickr30k as the target domains. Experimental results demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms the previous methods, and the style information incorporating with I-LSTM significantly improves the performance, with 5% CIDEr improvements at least on all datasets.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      In this work, we propose a non-linear hyperbolic-parabolic coupled Partial Differential Equation (PDE) based model for image despeckling. Here, a separate equation is used to calculate the edge variable, which improves the quality of edge information in the despeckled images. The existence of the weak solution of the present system is achieved via Schauder fixed point theorem. We used a generalized weighted average finite-difference scheme and the Gauss-Seidel iterative technique to solve the coupled system. Numerical studies are reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach with respect to standard PDE-based and nonlocal methods available in the literature. Numerical experiments are performed over gray-level images degraded by artificial speckle noise. Additionally, we investigate the noise removal efficiency of the proposed algorithm when applied to real synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Ultrasound images. Overall, our study confirms that in most cases, the present model performs better than the other PDE-based models and shows competitive performance with the nonlocal technique. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed despeckling approach is the first work that utilizes the advantage of the non-linear coupled hyperbolic-parabolic PDEs for image despeckling.

      Repeatable, convergent outcomes are prima facie evidence for determinism in evolutionary processes. Among fishes, well-known examples include microevolutionary habitat transitions into the water column, where freshwater populations (e.g., sticklebacks, cichlids, and whitefishes) recurrently diverge toward slender-bodied pelagic forms and deep-bodied benthic forms. However, the consequences of such processes at deeper...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Pnas-RssFeedOfEarlyEditionArticles/~4/FgxKzBIPOmc" width="1">
