      Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach where multiple clients collaboratively train a joint model without exchanging their data. Despite FL's unprecedented success in data privacy-preserving, its vulnerability to free-rider attacks has attracted increasing attention. Existing defenses may be ineffective against highly camouflaged or high percentages of free riders. To address these challenges, we reconsider the defense from a novel perspective, i.e., model weight evolving frequency.Empirically, we gain a novel insight that during the FL's training, the model weight evolving frequency of free-riders and that of benign clients are significantly different. Inspired by this insight, we propose a novel defense method based on the model Weight Evolving Frequency, referred to as WEF-Defense.Specifically, we first collect the weight evolving frequency (defined as WEF-Matrix) during local training. For each client, it uploads the local model's WEF-Matrix to the server together with its model weight for each iteration. The server then separates free-riders from benign clients based on the difference in the WEF-Matrix. Finally, the server uses a personalized approach to provide different global models for corresponding clients. Comprehensive experiments conducted on five datasets and five models demonstrate that WEF-Defense achieves better defense effectiveness than the state-of-the-art baselines.

      Machine learning has become an appealing signature-less approach to detect and classify malware because of its ability to generalize to never-before-seen samples and to handle large volumes of data. While traditional feature-based approaches rely on the manual design of hand-crafted features based on experts knowledge of the domain, deep learning approaches replace the manual feature engineering process by an underlying system, typically consisting of a neural network with multiple layers, that perform both feature learning and classification altogether. However, the combination of both approaches could substantially enhance detection systems. In this paper we present an hybrid approach to address the task of malware classification by fusing multiple types of features defined by experts and features learned through deep learning from raw data. In particular, our approach relies on deep learning to extract N-gram like features from the assembly language instructions and the bytes of malware, and texture patterns and shapelet-based features from malware\'s grayscale image representation and structural entropy, respectively. These deep features are later passed as input to a gradient boosting model that combines the deep features and the hand-crafted features using an early-fusion mechanism. The suitability of our approach has been evaluated on the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge benchmark and results show that the proposed solution achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms gradient boosting and deep learning methods in the literature.

      We consider the standard $K$-armed bandit problem under a distributed trust model of differential privacy (DP), which enables to guarantee privacy without a trustworthy server. Under this trust model, previous work largely focus on achieving privacy using a shuffle protocol, where a batch of users data are randomly permuted before sending to a central server. This protocol achieves ($\epsilon,\delta$) or approximate-DP guarantee by sacrificing an additional additive $O\!\left(\!\frac{K\log T\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}}{\epsilon}\!\right)\!$ cost in $T$-step cumulative regret. In contrast, the optimal privacy cost for achieving a stronger ($\epsilon,0$) or pure-DP guarantee under the widely used central trust model is only $\Theta\!\left(\!\frac{K\log T}{\epsilon}\!\right)\!$, where, however, a trusted server is required. In this work, we aim to obtain a pure-DP guarantee under distributed trust model while sacrificing no more regret than that under central trust model. We achieve this by designing a generic bandit algorithm based on successive arm elimination, where privacy is guaranteed by corrupting rewards with an equivalent discrete Laplace noise ensured by a secure computation protocol. We also show that our algorithm, when instantiated with Skellam noise and the secure protocol, ensures \emph{R\'{e}nyi differential privacy} -- a stronger notion than approximate DP -- under distributed trust model with a privacy cost of $O\!\left(\!\frac{K\sqrt{\log T}}{\epsilon}\!\right)\!$.

      Encryption ransomware has become a notorious malware. It encrypts user data on storage devices like solid-state drives (SSDs) and demands a ransom to restore data for users. To bypass existing defenses, ransomware would keep evolving and performing new attack models. For instance, we identify and validate three new attacks, including (1) garbage-collection (GC) attack that exploits storage capacity and keeps writing data to trigger GC and force SSDs to release the retained data; (2) timing attack that intentionally slows down the pace of encrypting data and hides its I/O patterns to escape existing defense; (3) trimming attack that utilizes the trim command available in SSDs to physically erase data.
    </p>
    <p>
      To enhance the robustness of SSDs against these attacks, we propose RSSD, a ransomware-aware SSD. It redesigns the flash management of SSDs for enabling the hardware-assisted logging, which can conservatively retain older versions of user data and received storage operations in time order with low overhead. It also employs hardware-isolated NVMe over Ethernet to expand local storage capacity by transparently offloading the logs to remote cloud/servers in a secure manner. RSSD enables post-attack analysis by building a trusted evidence chain of storage operations to assist the investigation of ransomware attacks. We develop RSSD with a real-world SSD FPGA board. Our evaluation shows that RSSD can defend against new and future ransomware attacks, while introducing negligible performance overhead.

      This paper contributes to the verification of programs written in Bitcoin's smart contract language SCRIPT in the interactive theorem prover Agda. It focuses on the security property of access control for SCRIPT programs that govern the distribution of Bitcoins. It advocates that weakest preconditions in the context of Hoare triples are the appropriate notion for verifying access control. It aims at obtaining human-readable descriptions of weakest preconditions in order to close the validation gap between user requirements and formal specification of smart contracts.
    </p>
    <p>
      As examples for the proposed approach, the paper focuses on two standard SCRIPT programs that govern the distribution of Bitcoins, Pay to Public Key Hash (P2PKH) and Pay to Multisig (P2MS). The paper introduces an operational semantics of the SCRIPT commands used in P2PKH and P2MS, which is formalised in the Agda proof assistant and reasoned about using Hoare triples. Two methodologies for obtaining human-readable descriptions of weakest preconditions are discussed:
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) a step-by-step approach, which works backwards instruction by instruction through a script, sometimes grouping several instructions together;
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) symbolic execution of the code and translation into a nested case distinction, which allows to read off weakest preconditions as the disjunction of conjunctions of conditions along accepting paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      A syntax for equational reasoning with Hoare Triples is defined in order to formalise those approaches in Agda.

      An improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on Gaussian distribution model is proposed to realize the autotuning of weighting factors for the cost function design in the model predictive control method. First, the design principle of the weighting factors in model predictive torque control for permanent magnet synchronous motor system is analyzed. Then, using the root mean square of the current error in the two-phase rotating coordinate system and the system switching frequency as references, the objective function of the particles in the PSO is designed by considering the main control goals of reducing the torque ripple, the current total harmonic distortion, and the switching frequency. The Gaussian individual optimal distribution model is used to update the particle position on the structure of the conventional PSO algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method can solve the problem of weighting factors design as it reduces the switching frequency of the system while achieving excellent steady-state performance.

      As the higher order or generalized extended state observer (ESO), generalized proportional-integral (GPI) observer (GPIO) haves been proposed to enhance the active disturbance rejection (ADR) control (ADRC) system's disturbance rejection ability. However, different ADR controllers can be deduced based on the same order GPIO, resulting in different dynamic performances. In this article, ten different ADR controllers based on the fourth order GPIO are present. In order to reveal the relationship between these ADR controllers and the conventional ADR controllers based on the third order ESO, six different third-order-ESO-based ADR controllers are present and compared with the fourth-order-ESO-based ADR controllers. To ease the comparison between different ADRC systems, a common expression is built for different ADR controllers. A novel frequency-domain analysis method is also introduced to reveal how the observer and feedback control law affects the closed-loop control system's dynamic performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on the test bench based on dSPACE DS1103.

      Recently, model-based predictive current control (MB-PCC) has been presented as a good alternative to classical control algorithms in terms of simplicity and performance reliability. However, MB-PCC suffers from the high dependence on system parameters, which may deteriorate its performance under parameters variations. On the other hand, synchronous reluctance motors (SynRMs) are susceptible to suffer from inductances variations due to the magnetic saturation. Accordingly, in this article a new model-free predictive current control of SynRMs based on a recurrent neural network (RNN-PCC) is developed and proposed. The proposed RNN-PCC relies on the identification of the SynRM currents without considering any parameters. Simulation and experimental results show that both RNN-PCC and MB-PCC have similarly excellent dynamics, while better control performance and tracking errors can be achieved thanks to the proposed RNN-PCC.

</p>

<p>
      The wide bandwidth impedance of grid and inverter are the critical parameters for small-signal stability analysis and control optimization of grid-tied inverter systems. The impedance measurement is an effective way to obtain the grid and inverter impedance by injecting a series of perturbations into the measured system. However, previous studies fail to fully consider the adverse grid voltage conditions; including harmonics, unbalance, frequency deviation, voltage sag, and phase jump; which may bring errors to the measured impedance. In this article, a cascaded delayed signal cancellation (CDSC)-based method is proposed to accurately obtain the impedance of the measured system under adverse grid voltage conditions. The proposed CDSC-based method is mainly composed of the perturbation extraction module (PEM) and frequency adaptive module (FAM). Different CDSC blocks are applied to implement the PEM and FAM to extract the injected perturbations adaptively, under various adverse grid voltage conditions. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiment results are presented to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed impedance measurement method.

      This articledemonstrates the developments toward a high-performance monolithic wheeled structure horizontal dual-axis [pitch (X-axis) and roll (Y-axis)] microelectromechanical system (MEMS) gyroscope based on off-plane coupling suppression silicon gratings. Gyroscopes have been fabricated with a silicon-on-glass fabrication process with vacuum sealed in metal packaging. The featured gyroscope operates in split mode with the bandwidths of two axes devices both of &#8764;70 Hz. By unitizing two individual active restraining control loops that adjust the quadrature amplitude via differentially biasing the silicon gratings in real time, the off-plane mechanical couplings of the two sense modes are significantly reduced by &#8764;95 and &#8764;30 times, which enables &#8764;25-fold and &#8764;56-fold improvements in the bias instability (BI) for a typical dual-axis device. Tactical-grade performances are achieved for both the X-axis and Y-axis gyroscopes with angle random walk of 0.02 deg/&#8730;h and 0.045 deg/&#8730;h along with in-run BI of 0.26 deg/h and 0.65 deg/h, respectively, without any temperature compensation. The current preliminary results show great potential to achieve navigation grade precision by employing the mode-matching technique in the future. The use of silicon gratings for out-of-plane coupling reduction also provides an effective way to build a high-performance planar monolithic chip inertial measurement unit.

      <p>
        Governments rely on citizen compliance for official rules to be effective. Yet achieving compliance is often tricky, particular when individual costs are high. Under what conditions will citizens voluntarily respect collective rules? We explore public compliance with SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus) restrictions, focusing on the role of political trust. We anticipate that the effects of trust on compliance will be conditional on the presence of other factors, notably fear of infection. Low levels of fear may provide room for trust to shape compliance; yet high levels of fear may &#8216;crowd out&#8217; the role of trust. We hypothesize that, at the pandemic&#8217;s outset, compliance was likely to be shaped more by fear than by trust. Yet as the pandemic progressed, the impact of fear on compliance was likely to have weakened, and the impact of trust to have strengthened. These hypotheses are tested using longitudinal data from Austria, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

        Little is known about whether and under which conditions populist radical right parties&#8217; (PRRPs&#8217;) nativist welfare politics matters to the voters. I address this gap in the research and test the argument that the electoral appeal of this electoral discourse varies among welfare regimes. The study compares the conservative and social-democratic welfare regimes and focuses on the vote choices of the two core constituencies of PRRPs &#8211; economically exposed and immigration-sceptic voters. The results show that these electorates support PRRPs&#8217; nativist welfare positions for very different reasons in the two welfare regimes. First, in the conservative regime, economically exposed citizens vote for PRRPs, the more they stress nativism and welfare expansion. By contrast, in the social-democratic regime this group of voters is more likely to support positions combining nativism and dismantled welfare benefits. Second, immigrant-sceptic voters in the social-democratic regime support PRRPs who pledge to preserve the welfare state, and increased migration considerably boosts the probability that they do so. By contrast, this group of voters in the conservative regime is more likely to support PRRPs who seek to partly dismantle the welfare state, and the inflow of immigrants is unrelated to these choices. These results have important implications and suggest that welfare regimes moderate public opinion differently in the current age of populism compared to previous eras.

        Can non-citizen enfranchisement policies reduce the turnout gap between citizens with an immigration background and native citizen voters? While increasingly common in practice, there are only a handful of studies on the political consequences of non-citizen enfranchisement on voter mobilisation. Here, we examine the impact of non-citizen voting (NCV) rights on the political participation of citizens with and without an immigration background. Focusing on Switzerland, we use high-quality household panel data (SHP) from 1999 to 2014, leveraging both longitudinal and municipal level variation of enfranchisement laws when identifying their effect on turnout. We show that NCV rights boost political participation overall, and it particularly enhances turnout among citizens with an immigration background. Our analysis adds to existing theoretical explanations and empirical debates on representation and political participation in diverse democratic societies with large immigrant populations.

<div class="abstract">
      <p>
        In 2014, the USA initiated the formation of a multilateral military operation against Daesh in Syria and Iraq. Eventually, more than 70 states joined the anti-Daesh coalition. However, contributions to the military effort have been characterized by great variance, especially among EU member states. While some states took leading roles in the airstrikes, others provided training for Iraqi and Kurdish forces, and still others did not get involved beyond voicing their support for the policy. Against this backdrop, this article makes a two-fold contribution to the literature on military coalitions and security policy. Empirically, the article provides a mapping of the then 28 EU member states&#8217; military engagement in the fight against Daesh in Syria and Iraq. Analytically, fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) is applied to account for the observed pattern of military involvement, using an integrative framework that combines international and domestic factors. The results demonstrate that multiple paths led towards EU military involvement in the anti-Daesh coalition. At the same time, international-level incentives, such as external threat and/or alliance value feature prominently in all three identified paths. The analysis further underscores the value of a configurational perspective, because neither an external threat nor alliance value are sufficient on their own to bring about the outcome. Across the set-theoretic configurations, these conditions either combine with other &#8216;push&#8217; factors or with the absence of constraints against military involvement. In line with the latter, the article highlights the policy relevance of institutional constraints, especially legislative veto rights, since most of those countries that were involved in the airstrikes of the anti-Daesh coalition did not have formal parliamentary involvement on matters of military deployment policy.

      To the Editor In an updated Recommendation Statement, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) in asymptomatic patients aged 50 years or older. When deciding whether to screen patients for AF, we encourage clinicians to consider the potential effect of subclinical AF on minoritized populations, including racial and ethnic minoritized groups such as American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, and Hispanic or Latino populations.

      A new data retrieval approach utilizing selective staining is explored to differentiate &#8220;0&#8221; from &#8220;1&#8221; cells in EEPROM and Flash memory with node sizes of 40 nm and 250 nm. A two-step staining process based on selective oxide etching and copper galvanic displacement deposition is introduced. The underlying mechanism is attributed to the difference in electric field across the tunnel oxide, which originates from the presence or absence of charges stored in the floating gates. With proper sample preparation, the selectively stained and non-stained cells can be characterized with optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, to facilitate direct read-out of data in a time-efficient manner. The physical layout of individual memory cells with respect to the stored data is identified. A systematic data retrieval is achieved with an accuracy of 95% at individual bit level. This selective staining technique marks the data permanently on the chip that allows for subsequent analysis and evidence retention.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      Background clutters pose challenges to defocus blur detection. Existing approaches often produce artifact predictions in background areas with clutter and relatively low confident predictions in boundary areas. In this work, we tackle the above issues from two perspectives. Firstly, inspired by the recent success of self-attention mechanism, we introduce channel-wise and spatial-wise attention modules to attentively aggregate features at different channels and spatial locations to obtain more discriminative features. Secondly, we propose a generative adversarial training strategy to suppress spurious and low reliable predictions. This is achieved by utilizing a discriminator to identify predicted defocus map from ground-truth ones. As such, the defocus network (generator) needs to produce &#8216;realistic&#8217; defocus map to minimize discriminator loss. We further demonstrate that the generative adversarial training allows exploiting additional unlabeled data to improve performance, a.k.a. semi-supervised learning, and we provide the first benchmark on semi-supervised defocus detection. Finally, we demonstrate that the existing evaluation metrics for defocus detection generally fail to quantify the robustness with respect to thresholding. For a fair and practical evaluation, we introduce an effective yet efficient $AUF_beta $ metric. Extensive experiments on three public datasets verify the superiority of the proposed methods compared against state-of-the-art approaches.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      This article investigates the distributed state estimation problem for large-scale power systems with the appearance of bad data. The power system is decomposed into several nonoverlapping agents and these agents interact with each other through transmission lines to form an interconnected multiagent power system (IMAPS). The measurement at each agent is local measurement, and the measurement in transmission line is edge measurement. To obtain an accurate state estimation of each agent in a distributed manner when the measurements are coupled with bad data, a bad data detection process should be designed. The difficulty is how to detect the bad data in edge measurement in a distributed scheme. To solve this problem, the characteristics of the edge measurement residual is analyzed, and a distributed bad data detection strategy is presented based on a novel iterative distributed Kalman-like filter (IDKF). It is proved that the IDKF algorithm can converge in finite steps when the communication graph of the IMAPS is acyclic, and the estimation accuracy is similar to that of the centralized Kalman filter. In addition, the IDKF algorithm shows excellent performance even when bad data appears. Simulation tests conducted on the IEEE 118-bus power system verify the theoretical findings.

</p>

      Vibration signals and infrared images have different advantages and characteristics. Although a few recent researches have explored their information fusion in rotating machinery fault diagnosis, they show limited performance when facing strong interference and imbalanced cases. Therefore, a fusion framework based on confidence weight support matrix machine (CWSMM) is proposed. In this framework, CWSMM can not only fully leverage the structure information of infrared thermography images and vibration time&#8211;frequency images, but also has the following novelties. First, CWSMM uses dynamic penalty factors for different class samples to address the class imbalance problem. Second, by using the prior knowledge of matrix samples, a confidence weight assignment strategy is designed for CWSMM to improve the robustness. Last, the Dempster&#8211;Shafer (D-S) evidence theory is applied to fuse the posterior probability outputs of CWSMMs using different measurements. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method has promising fault diagnosis performance, specifically under strong interference and imbalanced datasets.

      The power produced by a wind turbine depends on environmental conditions, working parameters, and interactions with nearby turbines. However, these aspects are often neglected in the design of data-driven models for wind farms&#8217; performance analysis. In this article, we propose to predict the active power and to provide reliable prediction intervals via ensembles of multivariate polynomial regression models that exploit a higher number of inputs (compared to most approaches in the literature), including operational and thermal variables. We present two main strategies: the former considers the environmental measurements collected at the other wind turbines in the farm as additional modeling information for the turbine under analysis; the latter combines multiple models relative to different operative conditions. We validate our approach on real data from the SCADA system of a wind farm in Italy and obtain a MAE of the order of 1.0% of the rated power of the turbine. Moreover, due to the structure of our approach, we can gain quantitative insights on the covariates most frequently selected depending on the working region of the wind turbines.

      Distributed energy sources including renewable energy (RE) sources and electric vehicle (EV) discharging offer opportunities to improve grid performance. Although uncoordinated EV charging can perfectly meet users&#8217; driving needs, it brings great challenges in maintaining the quality of low voltage (LV) distribution grids. Most existing EV control strategies do not take into account the heterogeneous nature of EV charging, including the various users&#8217; travel needs and the intermittent nature of RE sources. This article proposes a hierarchical control method that simultaneously coordinates EV charging by considering a dynamic energy tariff, RE sources, EV hardware characteristics, and particularly the EV&#8217;s driving needs. The proposed local controller sends the EV&#8217;s charging priority and required energy to the central controller based on the EV&#8217;s hardware characteristics and users&#8217; driving needs. The central controller then uses this information along with the energy tariff from the retailer and the present grid performance to control EV&#8217;s charging or discharging power. The efficacy of this hierarchical control method is evaluated using an Australian LV grid. The obtained results show that this method can reduce the neutral current and voltage imbalance with the maximized usage of renewable energy resources while the EV users&#8217; driving needs are met.

      It has been shown that the SK scheme, which was proposed by Schalkwijk and Kailath, is a self-secure capacity-achieving (SSCA) feedback scheme for the Gaussian wiretap channel, i.e., the SK scheme not only achieves the feedback capacity of the Gaussian channel, but also is secure by itself and achieves the feedback secrecy capacity of the Gaussian wiretap channel. For the multi-user wiretap channels, very recently, it has been shown that Ozarow&#8217;s capacity-achieving feedback scheme for the two-user Gaussian multiple-access channel (GMAC) is the SSCA feedback scheme for the two-user Gaussian multiple-access wiretap channel (GMAC-WT). In this paper, first, we propose a SSCA feedback scheme for the two-user GMAC-WT with degraded message sets (GMAC-WT-DMS). Next, we extend the above scheme to the two-user GMAC-WT-DMS with noncausal channel state information at the transmitters (NCSIT), and show that the extended scheme is also a SSCA feedback scheme. Finally, we derive outer bounds on the secrecy capacity regions of the two-user GMAC-WT-DMS with or without NCSIT, and numerical results show the rate gains by the feedback.

      Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to enhance the generalization capability of a certain model from a source domain to a target domain. Present UDA models focus on alleviating the domain shift by minimizing the feature discrepancy between the source domain and the target domain but usually ignore the class confusion problem. In this work, we propose an Inter-class Separation and Intra-class Aggregation (ISIA) mechanism. It encourages the cross-domain representative consistency between the same categories and differentiation among diverse categories. In this way, the features belonging to the same categories are aligned together and the confusable categories are separated. By measuring the align complexity of each category, we design an Adaptive-weighted Instance Matching (AIM) strategy to further optimize the instance-level adaptation. Based on our proposed methods, we also raise a hierarchical unsupervised domain adaptation framework for cross-domain semantic segmentation task. Through performing the image-level, feature-level, category-level and instance-level alignment, our method achieves a stronger generalization performance of the model from the source domain to the target domain. In two typical cross-domain semantic segmentation tasks, i.e., GTA $5rightarrow $ Cityscapes and SYNTHIA $rightarrow $ Cityscapes, our method achieves the state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy. We also build two cross-domain semantic segmentation datasets based on the publicly available data, i.e., remote sensing building segmentation and road segmentation, for domain adaptive segmentation. Our code, models and datasets are available at https://github.com/HibiscusYB/BAFFT.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">

      Semi-supervised few-shot learning aims to improve the model generalization ability by means of both limited labeled data and widely-available unlabeled data. Previous works attempt to model the relations between the few-shot labeled data and extra unlabeled data, by performing a label propagation or pseudo-labeling process using an episodic training strategy. However, the feature distribution represented by the pseudo-labeled data itself is coarse-grained, meaning that there might be a large distribution gap between the pseudo-labeled data and the real query data. To this end, we propose a sample-centric feature generation (SFG) approach for semi-supervised few-shot image classification. Specifically, the few-shot labeled samples from different classes are initially trained to predict pseudo-labels for the potential unlabeled samples. Next, a semi-supervised meta-generator is utilized to produce derivative features centering around each pseudo-labeled sample, enriching the intra-class feature diversity. Meanwhile, the sample-centric generation constrains the generated features to be compact and close to the pseudo-labeled sample, ensuring the inter-class feature discriminability. Further, a reliability assessment (RA) metric is developed to weaken the influence of generated outliers on model learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed feature generation approach on challenging one- and few-shot image classification benchmarks.

      As cities become smarter, the importance of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) will be increasingly pronounced. To support latency- and time-sensitive applications, there have been attempts to utilize fog-cloud computing in VANETs. There are, however, a number of limitations in existing fog-cloud based VANET deployments, ranging from computation and communication bottlenecks to privacy leakage to costly certificate/ pseudonym management to key escrow, and so on. Therefore, in this paper we propose a privacy-preserving aggregation authentication scheme (PPAAS). The scheme is designed for deployment in a safety warning system for fog-cloud based VANETs. Specifically, the PPAAS scheme is realized using a novel efficient anonymous certificateless aggregation signcryption scheme (CASS) proposed in this paper, and allows a fog node to aggregate signcrypted traffic-related messages from surrounding vehicles into an aggregated ciphertext and unsigncrypt them in a batch. We then evaluate the security of PPAAS and demonstrate that it supports confidentiality, authentication, and (efficient) conditional privacy, and key escrow freeness. In particular, our scheme is the first in the literature to achieve efficient conditional privacy, which avoids the need for costly pseudonym management. We also demonstrate that the scheme is practical, based on our simulation results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">

      This paper presents a new method, named implicit and explicit feature purification (IEFP), for age-invariant face recognition. Facial features extracted from a face image contain the information about the identity, age, and other attributes. For age-invariant face recognition, it is important to remove the irrelevant information, and retain the identity information only, in the facial features. Through the two proposed feature purification mechanisms, our framework can produce facial-feature embeddings that preserve identity information as much as possible and are insensitive to age variations. Specifically, on the one hand, a special network module is devised to implicitly purify the original facial features obtained from a face encoder. On the other hand, to obtain purer facial feature representations for age-invariant face recognition, irrelevant information within the implicitly purified features, such as the age, is further removed. This is realized by using a regularizer, based on information theory, to explicitly minimize the correlation between identity-related features and age-related features. Comprehensive ablation studies show that these two feature purification schemes can work independently, as well as collaboratively, to achieve better performance. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark data sets show that the IEFP method is on par with those competitors learned on far more favorable training samples, and it achieves the best performance in a fair comparison. Furthermore, we provide mathematical interpretation to explain the effectiveness of our approach, and find that it tends to generate low-rank, yet high-dimensional, representations for age-invariant face recognition.

      We propose a privacy-preserving Naive Bayes classifier and apply it to the problem of private text classification. In this setting, a party (Alice) holds a text message, while another party (Bob) holds a classifier. At the end of the protocol, Alice will only learn the result of the classifier applied to her text input and Bob learns nothing. Our solution is based on Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC). Our Rust implementation provides a fast and secure solution for the classification of unstructured text. Applying our solution to the case of spam detection (the solution is generic, and can be used in any other scenario in which the Naive Bayes classifier can be employed), we can classify an SMS as spam or ham in less than 340ms in the case where the dictionary size of Bob&#8217;s model includes all words ( $n = 5200$ ) and Alice&#8217;s SMS has at most $m = 160$ unigrams. In the case with $n = 369$ and $m = 8$ (the average of a spam SMS in the database), our solution takes only 21ms.

<div class="itemdescription">

      In this paper, we propose a novel method for boundary detection in close-range hyperspectral images. This method can effectively predict the boundaries of objects of similar colour but different materials. To effectively extract the material information in the image, the spatial distribution of the spectral responses of different materials or endmembers is first estimated by hyperspectral unmixing. The resulting abundance map represents the fraction of each endmember spectra at each pixel. The abundance map is used as a supportive feature such that the spectral signature and the abundance vector for each pixel are fused to form a new spectral feature vector. Then different spectral similarity measures are adopted to construct a sparse spectral-spatial affinity matrix that characterizes the similarity between the spectral feature vectors of neighbouring pixels within a local neighborhood. After that, a spectral clustering method is adopted to produce eigenimages. Finally, the boundary map is constructed from the most informative eigenimages. We created a new HSI dataset and use it to compare the proposed method with four alternative methods, one for hyperspectral image and three for RGB image. The results exhibit that our method outperforms the alternatives and can cope with several scenarios that methods based on colour images cannot handle.

      Adaptive prediction is an important tool for efficient compression of non-stationary signals. A common approach to achieve adaptivity is to switch between a set of prediction modes, designed to capture variations in signal statistics. The design poses several challenges including: i) catastrophic instability due to statistical mismatch driven by propagation through the prediction loop, and ii) severe non-convexity of the cost surface that is often riddled with poor local minima. Motivated by these challenges, this paper presents a near-optimal method for designing prediction modes for adaptive compression. The proposed method builds on a stable, open-loop platform, but with a subterfuge that ensures that the design is asymptotically optimized for closed-loop operation. The non-convexity is handled by deterministic annealing, a powerful optimization tool to avoid poor local minima. To demonstrate the impact of the proposed approach on practical applications, we consider adaptive, transform-domain predictor design for enhancing standard video coding. Experimental results validate the benefits of the proposed design in terms of significant performance gains for both predictive compression systems in general and video coding in particular.
