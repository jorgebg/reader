      The increased use of smart Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEV) opened a new area of research and development. The number of EV charging sites has considerably increased in residential as well as in public areas. Within these EV charging sites, various entities need to communicate in a secure and efficient way. The Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) offers a way to coordinate this communication and is already being used in many implementations. However, only the latest OCPP 2.0 version of the protocol includes certain security features. In this article, we present the entities that take part in an OCPP-based smart charging scenario, we identify security issues and threats and present solutions that have been proposed by scholars.We identify open security issues for OCPP and propose future research directions for the security enhancement of the protocol.

      The development of blockchain applications increased the demand for blockchain performance. Among the attempts of many blockchain scale-out solutions, sharding can improve performance and reduce the storage requirements of each node. Sharding enhances the throughput of the entire blockchain. Most sharding solutions have a fixed number of shards. We propose Wider chain with sharding by account. The number of shards is increased to unlimited. Meanwhile, Wider combines the idea of rollup and retains the main chain to confirm the status of the subchains. This design can avoid the Proof of Work computing power being scattered to the subchains and ensure the security of the blockchain.

<p>
      Nowadays, systems based on machine learning (ML) are widely used in different domains. Given their popularity, ML models have become targets for various attacks. As a result, research at the intersection of security and privacy, and ML has flourished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The research community has been exploring the attack vectors and potential mitigations separately. However, practitioners will likely need to deploy defences against several threats simultaneously. A solution that is optimal for a specific concern may interact negatively with solutions intended to address other concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this work, we explore the potential for conflicting interactions between different solutions that enhance the security/privacy of ML-base systems. We focus on model and data ownership; exploring how ownership verification techniques interact with other ML security/privacy techniques like differentially private training, and robustness against model evasion. We provide a framework, and conduct systematic analysis of pairwise interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We show that many pairs are incompatible. Where possible, we provide relaxations to the hyperparameters or the techniques themselves that allow for the simultaneous deployment. Lastly, we discuss the implications and provide guidelines for future work.

      Authentication and authorization of a user's identity are generally done by the service providers or identity providers. However, these centralized systems limit the user's control of their own identity and are prone to massive data leaks due to their centralized nature. We propose a blockchain-based identity management system to authenticate and authorize users using attribute-based access control policies and privacy-preserving algorithms and finally returning the control of a user's identity to the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our proposed system would use a private blockchain, which would store the re-certification events and data access and authorization requests for users' identities in a secure, verifiable manner, thus ensuring the integrity of the data. This paper suggests a mechanism to digitize documents such as passports, driving licenses, electricity bills, etc., issued by any government authority or other authority in an immutable and secure manner. The data owners are responsible for authenticating and propagating the users' identities as and when needed using the OpenID Connect protocol to enable single sign-on. We use advanced cryptographic algorithms to provide pseudonyms to the users, thus ensuring their privacy. These algorithms also ensure the auditability of transactions as and when required. Our proposed system helps in mitigating some of the issues in the recent privacy debates. The project finds its applications in citizen transfers, inter-country service providence, banks, ownership transfer, etc. The generic framework can also be extended to a consortium of banks, hospitals, etc.

      Since Spectre and Meltdown's disclosure in 2018, a new category of attacks has been identified and characterized by the scientific community. The Foreshadow attack, which was the first one to target Intel's secure enclave technology (namely SGX) has been developed shortly after. It opened the way to micro architectural attacks on Intel's architecture, and led to the quick development of micro architectural attacks until today. While Spectre and Meltdown are often considered as the first micro architectural attacks, one can argue that cache attacks, as introduced by Osvik et al. in 2006, can be seen as the first types of micro architectural attacks that were developed. Now, even though there are many variants, they are still the most prominent type of micro architectural attacks. One example of cache micro architectural covert-channel is the Prime+Probe. Lately targeting the Intel architecture, the micro architectural attacks are now challenging a wider variety of CPUs. Recently, CPUs running the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture have been targeted. One famous and widely used RISC-V CPU is the ETH Zurich's CVA6 (formerly Ariane) core. CVA6 is a 6-stage, single issue, in-order CPU. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing document presenting very detailed aspects of the CVA6's micro architecture, especially with respect to the data cache. Such information is mandatory to deeply understand any architectural or micro architectural study successfully, such as the replication of the Prime+Probe attack on the CVA6 CPU proposed by Nils Wistoff. This paper presents the implementation of the Data cache in the CVA6 CPU from OpenHW Group by focusing on its memory structure and explaining through several examples what happens when a request for memory allocation occurs.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      The potential to prevent food allergy has been a topic of increasing interest over the past 40 to 50 years. Studies on this topic date back to at least 1936, and a series of studies in the 1980s and 1990s produced inconsistent, but often compelling, data on the potential benefits of breastfeeding, specialized infant formulas, or delaying introduction of allergenic foods. Based on this body of evidence, as well as substantial expert opinion, a guideline by the American Academy of Pediatrics published in 2000 recommended the use of hydrolyzed formulas and delayed introduction of allergenic foods, including peanut, until the age of 3 years. However, expert opinion turned out to be wrong and some of the most persuasive studies were subsequently retracted as fraudulent. As new data emerged and the prevalence of food allergy continued to increase, the 2000 guidelines were replaced by updated recommendations in 2008 that essentially left these decisions &#8220;to personal and family preference,&#8221; because the available evidence was insufficient to justify any specific guidelines.

      In Reply In his Letter to the Editor about our recent Review of the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis, Dr Ben Salem discusses drug-induced sarcoidosis-like reactions as being part of the differential diagnosis for sarcoidosis. In addition to the several classes of medications mentioned by Ben Salem, we would like to add a few other drugs that are associated with drug-induced sarcoidosis-like reactions and may specifically involve the lung. These include methotrexate, ribavirin, rituximab, sulfasalazine, tocilizumab, rituximab, daclizumab, ustekinumab, and drugs used to treat precapillary pulmonary hypertension. We expect more drugs to be added to this list of medications causing drug-induced sarcoidosis-like reactions over time.

      Weakly supervised action localization is a challenging task with extensive applications, which aims to identify actions and the corresponding temporal intervals with only video-level annotations available. This paper analyzes the order-sensitive and location-insensitive properties of actions, and embodies them into a self-augmented learning framework to improve the weakly supervised action localization performance. To be specific, we propose a novel two-branch network architecture with intra/inter-action shuffling, referred to as ActShufNet. The intra-action shuffling branch lays out a self-supervised order prediction task to augment the video representation with inner-video relevance, whereas the inter-action shuffling branch imposes a reorganizing strategy on the existing action contents to augment the training set without resorting to any external resources. Furthermore, the global-local adversarial training is presented to enhance the model&#8217;s robustness to irrelevant noises. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets, and the results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

      Economic inequalities have increased substantially across the world in the past three decades and have deepened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thomas Piketty and his colleagues at the World Inequality Lab at the Paris School of Economics (PSE), France, have been at the forefront of tracking these changes, providing extremely useful analyses based on careful aggregation of national data on income and wealth inequality from a multitude of sources. They have shown that globally, inequality is now as entrenched as it was during the first part of the 20th century.

      The emergence of a series of epidemiologically connected monkeypox virus infections around the world, with ongoing human-to-human transmission (as of June 15, 2022, 2103 confirmed cases, one probable case, and one death have been reported to WHO from 42 countries), raises concerns of a long-apprehended comeback of a human-adapted orthopoxvirus related to variola virus, the aetiological agent of smallpox. Since variola virus had no natural reservoir other than humans, the eradication of the virus by use of highly effective vaccines against orthopoxviruses was irreversible.

      Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a popular technique for sequence alignment, and is the de facto standard for dynamic signature verification. In this paper, we go a significant step further to enhance DTW with the capability of deep representation learning, and propose an end-to-end trainable Deep soft-DTW (DsDTW) model for dynamic signature verification. Specifically, we design a convolutional recurrent adaptive network (CRAN) to process dynamic signatures, and utilize it to provide robust and discriminative local representations as inputs for DTW. As DTW is not fully differentiable with regard to its inputs, we introduce its smoothed formulation, soft-DTW, and incorporate the soft-DTW distances of signature pairs into the loss function for optimization. Because soft-DTW is differentiable, the proposed DsDTW is end-to-end trainable, and achieves an elegant integration of CRAN deep learning model and traditional DTW mechanism. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several public benchmarks, and has won first place in the ICDAR 2021 competition for online signature verification. Source codes of DsDTW is available at https://github.com/KAKAFEI123/DsDTW.

      Rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) will be increasingly utilized by residential customers due to their economic and environmental benefits. However, the intermittent power produced by PVs and the additional loads required for the PEV charging can cause power quality disturbances in the low-voltage distribution networks (LVDN). An adaptable correlated control (ACC) is proposed for the decoupled optimization of the active and reactive power, where energy cost can be minimized through the local demand-side management (DSM) of residential loads. Further, the optimal allocation of the sparse capacity of inverters for reactive power compensation to maintain the voltage variations and the mitigation of voltage unbalances within the allowable limits is proposed. The proposed ACC provides a supervisory control to observe and modify the voltage quality of the LVDN without the need for real-time collaboration between controllers. The impacts of the integration of installed rooftop PVs and PEV charging for unbalanced three-phase LVDNs are assessed rigorously using a versatile simulation platform. Also, the suitability of the proposed control strategy for DSM and the alleviation of voltage fluctuations and unbalances are assessed.

      In industrial processes, data-driven soft sensors have played an important role for the effective process control, optimization, and monitoring. Deep learning technique has been widely used in soft sensor field in recent years for its excellent feature representation capability in spatial and temporal scales. However, the shortcomings for deep learning technique seriously hinder its application in industrial processes. For example, the knowledge cannot be added into the model, and the model prediction could not be well explained. To solve those problems, the graph mining, convolution, and explanation framework is proposed for knowledge automation in this article. Based on the equivalence analysis of the self-attention mechanism (SAM) and graph convolution (GC) operation, the spatial SAM is adopted for knowledge discovery from data directly. After that, the GC layer considering the relationship between process variables can utilize the knowledge for constructing soft sensor models. Besides, to explain which knowledge contributes to the final model prediction, the graph neural network explainer is designed for explaining the model output. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the framework are evaluated on an industrial process, in which the knowledge discovered from the data is of great consistence with the prior knowledge, and the final explanation indicated that most of the knowledge is consistent with the prior knowledge contributed to the prediction.

      N OWADAYS, billions of devices are connected to the In-ternet, enabling Internet of Things (IoT) systems widely deployed, such as smart city, smart healthcare and intelligent plant, to capture a great quantity of sensing data. Consequently, the data transmission, processing and analysis in IoT applications bring a great pressure to the central server. Fortunately, distributed intelligence becomes one of the potential solutions. Distributed intelligence can greatly relieve server pressures via plenty of terminal devices, and these devices collaboratively perceive and handle the mass data to improve the reliability, s-calability and security of industrial IoT systems. As future IoT system will embrace more wireless sensors and devices, the high-performance computing, high-bandwidth and low-latency communication are excessively required, many new research opportunities and challenges for distributed intelligence over Internet of things have arisen. To promote the development of distributed intelligence technology, this special section (SS) focuses on various technologies and platforms regarding industrial IoT systems. This special section received nearly 50 submitted manuscripts, out of which 10 of them have been accepted after a rigorous peer review. Each manuscript is reviewed by multiple rounds of review with at least three or four reviewers, the problems to be solved and the innovation of each manuscript are mainly concerned. Then the accepted papers are summarized as follows in details. Considering the joint optimization of the offloading decision and resource allocation under limited resource constraints in collaborative edge computing networks with multiple IIoT devices and MEC servers, an improved differential evolution algorithm [7] is proposed to minimize the weighted sum of cost of energy consumption and time delay, which can effectively reduce the system delay and energy consumption. In order to improve the performance of task scheduling in cloud computing- Attiya et al. [1] propose a novel hybrid swarm intelligence method MRFOSSA, which uses a modified Manta-Ray Foraging Optimizer (MRFO) and the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA). MRFOSSA is superior to other methods in terms of makespan time and cloud throughput. The research goal of the paper [5] is to design an intelligent computing offloading strategy for industrial applications in order to optimize costs and mitigate energy losses. Then the paper proposes to combine a fog controller and AI-based learning techniques so that the fog controller can intelligently assign tasks to the most appropriate fog devices and find the appropriate path to the target. Considering the resource utilization efficiency under dynamic overload requests and network states in IIoT, Chen et al. [2] propose DRL-based intelligent SFC orchestration scheme and jointly optimize the VNF deployment and SFC embedment by the improved DDQN algorithm, which can improve the performance of resource utilization rate, execution cost and delay compared with other representative schemes. To solve the problem of resource allocation and energy cost in Internet of Vehicles, Kong et al. [8] design a joint computing and caching framework and formulate the problem as a reinforcement learning problem to minimize the energy cost. On this basis, the optimization algorithm based on DDPG is proposed, which can effectively decrease energy costs. To reduce the query numbers of the object model when constructing adversarial examples, Zhang et al. [10] propose generating adversarial examples with shadow model (GASM), i.e., transfering the query operations to the designed shadow model, which can achieve high attack success rates. Chen et al. [3] revise a Decentralized-Wireless-Federated-Learning algorithm (DWFL) which utilizes the superposition property of the analog scheme. It can solve the problem of single failure, limited bandwidth resource and privacy protection in wireless federated learning algorithm, which can be appli

      The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a fast-growing network of Internet-connected sensing and actuating devices aimed to enhance manufacturing and industrial operations. This interconnection generates a high volume of data over the IIoT network and raises serious security (e.g., the rapid evolution of hacking techniques), privacy (e.g., adversaries performing data poisoning and inference attacks), and scalability issues. To mitigate the aforementioned challenges, this article presents, a new privacy-preserved threat intelligence framework (P2TIF) to protect confidential information and to identify cyber-threats in IIoT environments. There are two major elements in the proposed P2TIF framework. First, a scalable blockchain module that enables secure communication of IIoT data and prevents data poisoning attacks. Second, a deep learning module that transforms actual data into a new format and protects data from inference attacks using a deep variational autoencoder (DVAE) technique. The encoded data are then employed by a threat detection system using attention-based deep gated recurrent neural network (A-DGRNN) to recognize malicious patterns in IIoT environments. The proposed framework is validated using two different network data sources, i.e., ToN-IoT and IoT-Botnet. Security analysis and experimental results revealed the high efficiency and scalability of the proposed P2TIF framework.

      Security in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is vital as there are some cases where IIoT devices collect sensory information for crucial social production and life. Thus, designing secure and efficient communication channels is always a research hotspot. However, end devices have memory, computation, and power-supplying capacities limitations. Moreover, perfect forward secrecy (PFS), which means that long-term key exposure still discloses previous session keys, is a critical security property for authentication and key exchange (AKE). This article proposes an AKE protocol named SAKE* for the IIoT environment, where two types of keys (i.e., a master key and an evolution key) guarantee PFS. In addition, the SAKE* protocol merely uses concatenation, XOR, and hash-function operations to achieve lightweight authentication, key exchange, and message integrity. We also compare the SAKE* protocol with seven current and IoT-related authentication protocols regarding security properties and performance. Comparison results indicate that the SAKE* protocol consumes the least computation resource and third-least communication cost among eight AKE protocols while equipping 12 security properties.

      With the loss of a large number of space vectors under switch open-circuit faults, the neutral point potential (NPP) control of T-type three-level converters is faced with a huge challenge. It becomes harsh to balance the NPP and maintain the symmetry of line voltages under switch open-circuit faults simultaneously. In order to improve the NPP control performance and stable operation of T-type three-level converters, this article presents a hybrid modulation strategy that can enhance the NPP control ability even under switch open-circuit faults. Through a carrier-based analysis tool, two candidate modulation strategies are first evaluated from the perspective of the adjustment range of the neutral point current. The first one maintains the conventional three-level modulation in two nonfault phase arms. The second one degrades the mode of modulation from three-level modulation to two-level modulation in two nonfault phase arms. By making full use of the NPP oscillation characteristics of the two candidate methods, a hybrid modulation strategy based on transition duty-cycle and enabled bridge-arm adjustment is put forward to achieve a comprehensive optimal control performance. Numerical analysis and experiments are carried on to prove the correctness and feasibility of the proposed method.

<p>
      An improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on Gaussian distribution model is proposed to realize the autotuning of weighting factors for the cost function design in the model predictive control method. First, the design principle of the weighting factors in model predictive torque control for permanent magnet synchronous motor system is analyzed. Then, using the root mean square of the current error in the two-phase rotating coordinate system and the system switching frequency as references, the objective function of the particles in the PSO is designed by considering the main control goals of reducing the torque ripple, the current total harmonic distortion, and the switching frequency. The Gaussian individual optimal distribution model is used to update the particle position on the structure of the conventional PSO algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method can solve the problem of weighting factors design as it reduces the switching frequency of the system while achieving excellent steady-state performance.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      In this article, a fully soft switched interleaved bidirectional buck/boost converter with high voltage conversion ratio (VCR) and no pulsating current at low voltage source is proposed. Winding cross-coupled inductors technique is employed in order to increase VCR and mitigate current ripple at low voltage side. Moreover, soft switching conditions for all semiconductor devices are provided and the leakage inductances energy of coupled inductors are absorbed in both high step-up/down operating modes. Furthermore, the reverse recovery problem of all diodes is removed due to zero current switching turn off. All the mentioned advantages are achieved for a bidirectional converter with two interleaved phases in both high step-up/down operating modes by only one clamp circuit consisting of a clamp capacitor and two active switches. Also, the body diodes of the main switches are utilized as the main diodes to reduce the element count. The converter performance is validated by theoretical analysis and an 800 W prototype circuit in both operating modes.

<div class="itemdescription">

      Due to a short-time gap breakdown in electrical discharge machining (EDM), a high dynamic response and flexible discharge current control ability are required for a pulse power generator. Therefore, a one-cycle control(OCC) of output current for a buck-type EDM pulse power generator is proposed. Considering the inductor current operating state, a full-range OCC current control is presented, and the Taylor expansion method is used for the duty cycle calculation. A duty cycle optimization strategy is proposed for transient states. Based on the small signal modeling, the dynamic response ability of the system is analyzed. The discharge current can switch from many transient states to a steady state in a few switching cycles without a current overshoot, and follow the average current reference well in the steady state.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      The wide bandwidth impedance of grid and inverter are the critical parameters for small-signal stability analysis and control optimization of grid-tied inverter systems. The impedance measurement is an effective way to obtain the grid and inverter impedance by injecting a series of perturbations into the measured system. However, previous studies fail to fully consider the adverse grid voltage conditions; including harmonics, unbalance, frequency deviation, voltage sag, and phase jump; which may bring errors to the measured impedance. In this article, a cascaded delayed signal cancellation (CDSC)-based method is proposed to accurately obtain the impedance of the measured system under adverse grid voltage conditions. The proposed CDSC-based method is mainly composed of the perturbation extraction module (PEM) and frequency adaptive module (FAM). Different CDSC blocks are applied to implement the PEM and FAM to extract the injected perturbations adaptively, under various adverse grid voltage conditions. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiment results are presented to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed impedance measurement method.

        Social influence among people is widely understood to be a universal component of the human experience. However, studies of political behavior have generally approached social influence as specific to a type of behavior, such as voting, in a particular national context. There are good reasons to expect that social influence is observable across diverse behaviors and national contexts. In this study, we test this expectation using a two-wave panel survey of national samples in 19 countries. We employ autoregressive models that address some of the endogeneity challenges associated with attempts to measure social influence with survey designs. Our measure of social influence is predictive of diverse political behaviors in many countries with average effects comparable in size to important standard predictors of behavior.

        Little is known about whether and under which conditions populist radical right parties&#8217; (PRRPs&#8217;) nativist welfare politics matters to the voters. I address this gap in the research and test the argument that the electoral appeal of this electoral discourse varies among welfare regimes. The study compares the conservative and social-democratic welfare regimes and focuses on the vote choices of the two core constituencies of PRRPs &#8211; economically exposed and immigration-sceptic voters. The results show that these electorates support PRRPs&#8217; nativist welfare positions for very different reasons in the two welfare regimes. First, in the conservative regime, economically exposed citizens vote for PRRPs, the more they stress nativism and welfare expansion. By contrast, in the social-democratic regime this group of voters is more likely to support positions combining nativism and dismantled welfare benefits. Second, immigrant-sceptic voters in the social-democratic regime support PRRPs who pledge to preserve the welfare state, and increased migration considerably boosts the probability that they do so. By contrast, this group of voters in the conservative regime is more likely to support PRRPs who seek to partly dismantle the welfare state, and the inflow of immigrants is unrelated to these choices. These results have important implications and suggest that welfare regimes moderate public opinion differently in the current age of populism compared to previous eras.

        How do coalitional dynamics matter for the capacity of states to maintain social inclusion in coordinated models of capitalism? Taking its departure in scholarship emphasizing the influence of employers on the extent of state intervention in post-industrial economies, this paper argues that employer influence depends on which actors they team up with &#8211; unions or parties. If unions depend on employers for their organizational influence in a policy field, unions become a strong coalitional partner for employers in weakening demands for inclusiveness from the parliamentary arena. Conversely, if unions have influence independent of any coalition with employers, both unions and employers are likely to team up with political parties aligned with their preferences. This makes the level of inclusion resulting from increased state intervention more fluctuating, depending on who holds government power. A comparative study of reforms of Danish and Austrian vocational education institutions corroborates the empirical purchase of the argument.

        While there has been a veritable boom in literature on organized interests, their lobbying strategies, relationships with decision-makers, and their impact on policymaking, only a few studies have explored internal organizational developments and, specifically, the professionalization of interest groups. The present study focuses on the national and transnational factors driving the professionalization of interest groups in Central and Eastern Europe, a region previously neglected in much of the interest group literature. Based on a sample of more than 400 surveyed organizations operating in Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovenia in the healthcare, higher education, and energy sectors, we explore three bundles of factors potentially enhancing the professionalization of interest groups &#8211; organizational funding sources, national and transnational intergroup cooperation and organizations&#8217; standing in the domestic interest group system. Our statistical analyses show that state subsidies and tight policy coordination with the state are crucial drivers of internal organizational professionalization, suggesting rather patronistic and symbiotic relationships between the state and certain organizations. However, our data also support the notion that interorganizational collaboration, both at the national and international levels, may also be key to organizational professionalization, enabling groups that lack close ties with the state to compensate their disadvantage with intensive domestic and international networking. The study is also among the first to link increasing professionalization with organizational population density.

      Zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR) has attracted great attention recently, due to the potential application of sketch-based retrieval under zero-shot scenarios, where the categories of query sketches and gallery photos are not observed in the training stage. However, it is still under insufficient exploration for the general and practical scenario when the query sketches and gallery photos contain both seen and unseen categories. Such a problem is defined as generalized zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (GZS-SBIR), which is the focus of this work. To this end, we propose a novel Augmented Multi-modality Fusion (AMF) framework to generalize seen concepts to unobserved ones efficiently. Specifically, a novel knowledge discovery module named cross-domain augmentation is designed in both visual and semantic space to mimic novel knowledge unseen from the training stage, which is the key to handling the GZS-SBIR challenge. Moreover, a triplet domain alignment module is proposed to couple the cross-domain distribution between photo and sketch in visual space. To enhance the robustness of our model, we explore embedding propagation to refine both visual and semantic features by removing undesired noise. Eventually, visual-semantic fusion representations are concatenated for further domain discrimination and task-specific recognition, which tend to trigger the cross-domain alignment in both visual and semantic feature space. Experimental evaluations are conducted on popular ZS-SBIR benchmarks as well as a new evaluation protocol designed for GZS-SBIR from DomainNet dataset with more diverse sub-domains, and the promising results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution over other baselines.

      Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) is an emerging secure distributed learning paradigm that aggregates user-trained local gradients into a federated model through a cryptographic protocol. Unfortunately, PPFL is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks launched by a Byzantine adversary, who crafts malicious local gradients to harm the accuracy of the federated model. To resist model poisoning attacks, existing defense strategies focus on identifying suspicious local gradients over plaintexts. However, the Byzantine adversary submits encrypted poisonous gradients to circumvent existing defense strategies in PPFL, resulting in encrypted model poisoning. To address the issue, in this paper we design a privacy-preserving defense strategy using two-trapdoor homomorphic encryption (referred to as ShieldFL), which can resist encrypted model poisoning without compromising privacy in PPFL. Specially, we first present the secure cosine similarity method aiming to measure the distance between two encrypted gradients. Then, we propose the Byzantine-tolerance aggregation using cosine similarity, which can achieve robustness for both Independently Identically Distribution (IID) and non-IID data. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets (i.e., MNIST, KDDCup99, and Amazon) show that ShieldFL outperforms existing defense strategies. Especially, ShieldFL can achieve 30%-80% accuracy improvement to defend two state-of-the-art model poisoning attacks in both non-IID and IID settings.

      When public clouds become the platform of choice for MapReduce processing, users are placing higher demands on the privacy of the job data and program. A number of solutions employed trusted hardware to protect MapReduce tasks. However, existing works pointed out that simply protecting individual nodes in the MapReduce cluster with trusted hardware and protecting cross-node communication with encryption still leak information from side-channels. Specifically, attackers can derive data information by observing and manipulating cross-node communication traffic volumes. Although existing works proposed some solutions to prevent such leakage, in this paper, we show that previous solutions still leak critical job information. Additionally, our study shows that previous solutions have limitations from other aspects, including data restriction, partition function restriction, reliability issue, and high overheads. To address all the discovered limitations, we introduced the Strong Shuffle solution. Our analysis and experimental results showed that our solution has reduced the information leakage and addressed other discovered limitations. To support Strong Shuffle, we proposed a variant Bloom Filter, named Group-based Dynamic Bloom Filter (GDBF). Our theoretical analysis showed that GDBF has lower performance and storage overhead than the traditional Scalable Bloom Filter.

</p>

      Cloud storage is more and more prevalent in practice, and thus how to check its integrity becomes increasingly essential. A classical solution is identity-based (ID-based) provable data possession (PDP), which supports certificateless cloud storage auditing without entire user data. However, existing ID-PDP protocols always require that cloud users outsource data blocks, authenticators and a small-sized file tag to the cloud, and make use of the heavy elliptic curve cryptography over bilinear pairing. These disadvantages would result in vast storage, communication, and computation costs, which is unexpected, especially for resource-limited cloud users. To improve the performance, this paper proposes a novel cryptographic primitive: ID-based PDP with compressed cloud storage. In this model, cloud storage auditing can be achieved by using only encrypted data blocks in a self-verified way, and original data blocks can be reconstructed from the outsourced data. Thus, data owners no longer need to store original data blocks on the cloud. We also use some basic algebraic operations to realize a concrete ID-based PDP protocol with compressed cloud storage, which is quite efficient due to no heavy cryptographic operations involved. The proposed protocol can easily be extended to support the other practical functions by using the primitive replacement technique. The proposed protocol is strictly proven to have the properties of correctness, privacy, unforgeability and detectability. Finally, we give plenty of theoretical analysis and experimental results to validate the efficiency of the proposed protocol.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">

      It has been widely observed that deep neural networks are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. Decision-based attacks could generate adversarial examples based solely on top-1 labels returned by the target model. However, they typically make excessive queries and could not bypass detection effectively. To comprehensively assess a decision-based attack, besides its query efficiency, the performance against detection is also a concern. Considering that previous detections consume massive resources and always mistakenly recognize benign video frames as malicious attacks, we design a lightweight detection called boundary detection to overcome the above limitations, whose success reveals serious limitations of existing decision-based attacks. To develop more powerful attacks, we first present f-mixup as a basic method to produce candidate adversarial examples in the frequency domain. Using f-mixup as the building block, we propose f-attack as a complete decision-based attack. With the help of several natural images, f-attack could both work well with limited (hundreds of) queries and bypass detection effectively. Nevertheless, if the attacker could make relatively adequate (thousands of) queries and the target model is not equipped with detection, f-attack will lag behind existing decision-based attacks. We additionally introduce frequency binary search based on f-mixup, which serves as a plug-and-play module for existing decision-based attacks to further improve their query efficiency. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      Semi-supervised few-shot learning aims to improve the model generalization ability by means of both limited labeled data and widely-available unlabeled data. Previous works attempt to model the relations between the few-shot labeled data and extra unlabeled data, by performing a label propagation or pseudo-labeling process using an episodic training strategy. However, the feature distribution represented by the pseudo-labeled data itself is coarse-grained, meaning that there might be a large distribution gap between the pseudo-labeled data and the real query data. To this end, we propose a sample-centric feature generation (SFG) approach for semi-supervised few-shot image classification. Specifically, the few-shot labeled samples from different classes are initially trained to predict pseudo-labels for the potential unlabeled samples. Next, a semi-supervised meta-generator is utilized to produce derivative features centering around each pseudo-labeled sample, enriching the intra-class feature diversity. Meanwhile, the sample-centric generation constrains the generated features to be compact and close to the pseudo-labeled sample, ensuring the inter-class feature discriminability. Further, a reliability assessment (RA) metric is developed to weaken the influence of generated outliers on model learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed feature generation approach on challenging one- and few-shot image classification benchmarks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      The cross-domain image captioning, which is trained on a source domain and generalized to other domains, usually faces the large domain shift problem. Although prior work has attempted to leverage both paired source and unpaired target data to minimize this shift, the performance is still unsatisfactory. One main reason lies in the large discrepancy in language expression between two domains, where diverse language styles are adopted to describe an image from different views, resulting in different semantic descriptions for an image. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a Style-based Cross-domain Image Captioner (SCIC) which incorporates the discriminative style information into the encoder-decoder framework, and interprets an image as a special sentence according to external style instructions. Technically, we design a novel &#8220;Instruction-based LSTM&#8221;, which adds the instruct gate to collect a style instruction, and then outputs a specified format according to that instruction. Two objectives are designed to train I-LSTM: 1) generating correct image descriptions and 2) generating correct styles, thus the model is expected to accurately capture the semantic meanings of an image by the special caption as well as understand the syntactic structure of the caption. We use MS-COCO as the source domain, and Oxford-102, CUB-200, Flickr30k as the target domains. Experimental results demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms the previous methods, and the style information incorporating with I-LSTM significantly improves the performance, with 5% CIDEr improvements at least on all datasets.

</p>

      In this work, we propose a non-linear hyperbolic-parabolic coupled Partial Differential Equation (PDE) based model for image despeckling. Here, a separate equation is used to calculate the edge variable, which improves the quality of edge information in the despeckled images. The existence of the weak solution of the present system is achieved via Schauder fixed point theorem. We used a generalized weighted average finite-difference scheme and the Gauss-Seidel iterative technique to solve the coupled system. Numerical studies are reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach with respect to standard PDE-based and nonlocal methods available in the literature. Numerical experiments are performed over gray-level images degraded by artificial speckle noise. Additionally, we investigate the noise removal efficiency of the proposed algorithm when applied to real synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Ultrasound images. Overall, our study confirms that in most cases, the present model performs better than the other PDE-based models and shows competitive performance with the nonlocal technique. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed despeckling approach is the first work that utilizes the advantage of the non-linear coupled hyperbolic-parabolic PDEs for image despeckling.

      Repeatable, convergent outcomes are prima facie evidence for determinism in evolutionary processes. Among fishes, well-known examples include microevolutionary habitat transitions into the water column, where freshwater populations (e.g., sticklebacks, cichlids, and whitefishes) recurrently diverge toward slender-bodied pelagic forms and deep-bodied benthic forms. However, the consequences of such processes at deeper...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Pnas-RssFeedOfEarlyEditionArticles/~4/FgxKzBIPOmc" width="1">
