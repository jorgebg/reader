      Machine learning abilities have become a vital component for various solutions across industries, applications, and sectors. Many organizations seek to leverage AI-based solutions across their business services to unlock better efficiency and increase productivity. Problems, however, can arise if there is a lack of quality data for AI-model training, scalability, and maintenance. We propose a data-centric federated learning architecture leveraged by a public blockchain and smart contracts to overcome this significant issue. Our proposed solution provides a virtual public marketplace where developers, data scientists, and AI-engineer can publish their models and collaboratively create and access quality data for training. We enhance data quality and integrity through an incentive mechanism that rewards contributors for data contribution and verification. Those combined with the proposed framework helped increase with only one user simulation the training dataset with an average of 100 input daily and the model accuracy by approximately 4\%.

      Healthcare systems are increasingly incorporating Artificial Intelligence into their systems, but it is not a solution for all difficulties. AI's extraordinary potential is being held back by challenges such as a lack of medical datasets for training AI models, adversarial attacks, and a lack of trust due to its black box working style. We explored how blockchain technology can improve the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-based healthcare. This paper has conducted a Systematic Literature Review to explore the state-of-the-art research studies conducted in healthcare applications developed with different AI techniques and Blockchain Technology. This systematic literature review proceeds with three different paths as natural language processing-based healthcare systems, computer vision-based healthcare systems and acoustic AI-based healthcare systems. We found that 1) Defence techniques for adversarial attacks on AI are available for specific kind of attacks and even adversarial training is AI based technique which in further prone to different attacks. 2) Blockchain can address security and privacy issues in healthcare fraternity. 3) Medical data verification and user provenance can be enabled with Blockchain. 4) Blockchain can protect distributed learning on heterogeneous medical data. 5) The issues like single point of failure, non-transparency in healthcare systems can be resolved with Blockchain. Nevertheless, it has been identified that research is at the initial stage. As a result, we have synthesized a conceptual framework using Blockchain Technology for AI-based healthcare applications that considers the needs of each NLP, Computer Vision, and Acoustic AI application. A global solution for all sort of adversarial attacks on AI based healthcare. However, this technique has significant limits and challenges that need to be addressed in future studies.

      Recently issued data privacy regulations like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) grant individuals the right to be forgotten. In the context of machine learning, this requires a model to forget about a training data sample if requested by the data owner (i.e., machine unlearning). As an essential step prior to machine unlearning, it is still a challenge for a data owner to tell whether or not her data have been used by an unauthorized party to train a machine learning model. Membership inference is a recently emerging technique to identify whether a data sample was used to train a target model, and seems to be a promising solution to this challenge. However, straightforward adoption of existing membership inference approaches fails to address the challenge effectively due to being originally designed for attacking membership privacy and suffering from several severe limitations such as low inference accuracy on well-generalized models. In this paper, we propose a novel membership inference approach inspired by the backdoor technology to address the said challenge. Specifically, our approach of Membership Inference via Backdooring (MIB) leverages the key observation that a backdoored model behaves very differently from a clean model when predicting on deliberately marked samples created by a data owner. Appealingly, MIB requires data owners' marking a small number of samples for membership inference and only black-box access to the target model, with theoretical guarantees for inference results. We perform extensive experiments on various datasets and deep neural network architectures, and the results validate the efficacy of our approach, e.g., marking only 0.1% of the training dataset is practically sufficient for effective membership inference.

      Algorithms such as Differentially Private SGD enable training machine learning models with formal privacy guarantees. However, there is a discrepancy between the protection that such algorithms guarantee in theory and the protection they afford in practice. An emerging strand of work empirically estimates the protection afforded by differentially private training as a confidence interval for the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ spent on training a model. Existing approaches derive confidence intervals for $\varepsilon$ from confidence intervals for the false positive and false negative rates of membership inference attacks. Unfortunately, obtaining narrow high-confidence intervals for $\epsilon$ using this method requires an impractically large sample size and training as many models as samples. We propose a novel Bayesian method that greatly reduces sample size, and adapt and validate a heuristic to draw more than one sample per trained model. Our Bayesian method exploits the hypothesis testing interpretation of differential privacy to obtain a posterior for $\varepsilon$ (not just a confidence interval) from the joint posterior of the false positive and false negative rates of membership inference attacks. For the same sample size and confidence, we derive confidence intervals for $\varepsilon$ around 40% narrower than prior work. The heuristic, which we adapt from label-only DP, can be used to further reduce the number of trained models needed to get enough samples by up to 2 orders of magnitude.

      With the enactment of privacy-preserving regulations, e.g., GDPR, federated SVD is proposed to enable SVD-based applications over different data sources without revealing the original data. However, many SVD-based applications, such as principal components analysis in genetic studies dealing with billion-scale data, cannot be well supported by existing federated SVD solutions. The crux is that these solutions, adopting either differential privacy (DP) or homomorphic encryption (HE), suffer from accuracy loss caused by unremovable noise or degraded efficiency due to inflated data.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this paper, we propose FedSVD, a practical lossless federated SVD method over billion-scale data, which can simultaneously achieve lossless accuracy and high efficiency. At the heart of FedSVD is a lossless matrix masking scheme delicately designed for SVD: 1) While adopting the masks to protect private data, FedSVD completely removes them from the final results of SVD to achieve lossless accuracy; and 2) As the masks do not inflate the data, FedSVD avoids extra computation and communication overhead during the factorization to maintain high efficiency. Experiments with real-world datasets show that FedSVD is over 10000 times faster than the HE-based method and has 10 orders of magnitude smaller error than the DP-based solution on SVD tasks. We further build and evaluate FedSVD over three real-world applications: principal components analysis (PCA), linear regression (LR), and latent semantic analysis (LSA), to show its superior performance in practice. On federated LR tasks, compared with two state-of-the-art solutions: FATE [17] and SecureML [19], FedSVD-LR is 100 times faster than SecureML and 10 times faster than FATE.

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and health-care use worldwide. COPD is caused by exposure to inhaled noxious particles, notably tobacco smoke and pollutants. However, the broad range of factors that increase the risk of development and progression of COPD throughout the life course are increasingly being recognised. Innovations in omics and imaging techniques have provided greater insight into disease pathobiology, which might result in advances in COPD prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

      The present article proposes an effective model of synchronous reluctance machines. This model, called the Residual Magnetism (ReMa) model, takes into account not only residual magnetism within the rotor but also that within the stator. Electromotive forces generated by the ReMa model were composed of two frequencies and exhibited similar shapes as those measured in experiments. Resultant equations in a three-phase $(a,b,c)$ frame and in a Park reference frame $(d,q)$ were revealed. The comparison was made with the classical model of synchronous reluctance machine commonly used. Experimental tests were carried out to prove the effectiveness of the ReMa model which was also compared to a classical counterpart in the case where a synchronous reluctance generator was connected to a three-phase diode rectifier.

</p>

<p>
      Recently, model-based predictive current control (MB-PCC) has been presented as a good alternative to classical control algorithms in terms of simplicity and performance reliability. However, MB-PCC suffers from the high dependence on system parameters, which may deteriorate its performance under parameters variations. On the other hand, synchronous reluctance motors (SynRMs) are susceptible to suffer from inductances variations due to the magnetic saturation. Accordingly, in this article a new model-free predictive current control of SynRMs based on a recurrent neural network (RNN-PCC) is developed and proposed. The proposed RNN-PCC relies on the identification of the SynRM currents without considering any parameters. Simulation and experimental results show that both RNN-PCC and MB-PCC have similarly excellent dynamics, while better control performance and tracking errors can be achieved thanks to the proposed RNN-PCC.

      This article presents a new method for estimating the fault location in a voltage-source-converter-interfaced dc system. The proposed dc fault location estimation method evaluates the distance from the fault point to the dc line terminal by estimating the line inductance; hence, it is designated as $L$ location. Since the fault impedance usually only includes resistance, the proposed $L$ location is less affected by the variation of fault resistance. In addition, the ripple caused by the distributed capacitive discharge is excluded from the dc line current when the proposed $L$ location is applied in the dc system with the distributed-parameter transmission line. The cubic curve-fitting method is used to reconstruct the current signal based on the least squares method. The effectiveness of the proposed $L$ location is verified with an OPAL-RT-based multiterminal dc (MTDC) system and experimental point-to-point and MTDC systems. The comparison with the impedance estimation, the voltage-traveling-wave-based location, and the differential and directional protection substantiates the integral performance of the proposed method

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      The wide bandwidth impedance of grid and inverter are the critical parameters for small-signal stability analysis and control optimization of grid-tied inverter systems. The impedance measurement is an effective way to obtain the grid and inverter impedance by injecting a series of perturbations into the measured system. However, previous studies fail to fully consider the adverse grid voltage conditions; including harmonics, unbalance, frequency deviation, voltage sag, and phase jump; which may bring errors to the measured impedance. In this article, a cascaded delayed signal cancellation (CDSC)-based method is proposed to accurately obtain the impedance of the measured system under adverse grid voltage conditions. The proposed CDSC-based method is mainly composed of the perturbation extraction module (PEM) and frequency adaptive module (FAM). Different CDSC blocks are applied to implement the PEM and FAM to extract the injected perturbations adaptively, under various adverse grid voltage conditions. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiment results are presented to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed impedance measurement method.

      This articledemonstrates the developments toward a high-performance monolithic wheeled structure horizontal dual-axis [pitch (X-axis) and roll (Y-axis)] microelectromechanical system (MEMS) gyroscope based on off-plane coupling suppression silicon gratings. Gyroscopes have been fabricated with a silicon-on-glass fabrication process with vacuum sealed in metal packaging. The featured gyroscope operates in split mode with the bandwidths of two axes devices both of &#8764;70 Hz. By unitizing two individual active restraining control loops that adjust the quadrature amplitude via differentially biasing the silicon gratings in real time, the off-plane mechanical couplings of the two sense modes are significantly reduced by &#8764;95 and &#8764;30 times, which enables &#8764;25-fold and &#8764;56-fold improvements in the bias instability (BI) for a typical dual-axis device. Tactical-grade performances are achieved for both the X-axis and Y-axis gyroscopes with angle random walk of 0.02 deg/&#8730;h and 0.045 deg/&#8730;h along with in-run BI of 0.26 deg/h and 0.65 deg/h, respectively, without any temperature compensation. The current preliminary results show great potential to achieve navigation grade precision by employing the mode-matching technique in the future. The use of silicon gratings for out-of-plane coupling reduction also provides an effective way to build a high-performance planar monolithic chip inertial measurement unit.

        Social influence among people is widely understood to be a universal component of the human experience. However, studies of political behavior have generally approached social influence as specific to a type of behavior, such as voting, in a particular national context. There are good reasons to expect that social influence is observable across diverse behaviors and national contexts. In this study, we test this expectation using a two-wave panel survey of national samples in 19 countries. We employ autoregressive models that address some of the endogeneity challenges associated with attempts to measure social influence with survey designs. Our measure of social influence is predictive of diverse political behaviors in many countries with average effects comparable in size to important standard predictors of behavior.

        Governments rely on citizen compliance for official rules to be effective. Yet achieving compliance is often tricky, particular when individual costs are high. Under what conditions will citizens voluntarily respect collective rules? We explore public compliance with SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus) restrictions, focusing on the role of political trust. We anticipate that the effects of trust on compliance will be conditional on the presence of other factors, notably fear of infection. Low levels of fear may provide room for trust to shape compliance; yet high levels of fear may &#8216;crowd out&#8217; the role of trust. We hypothesize that, at the pandemic&#8217;s outset, compliance was likely to be shaped more by fear than by trust. Yet as the pandemic progressed, the impact of fear on compliance was likely to have weakened, and the impact of trust to have strengthened. These hypotheses are tested using longitudinal data from Austria, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

        Little is known about whether and under which conditions populist radical right parties&#8217; (PRRPs&#8217;) nativist welfare politics matters to the voters. I address this gap in the research and test the argument that the electoral appeal of this electoral discourse varies among welfare regimes. The study compares the conservative and social-democratic welfare regimes and focuses on the vote choices of the two core constituencies of PRRPs &#8211; economically exposed and immigration-sceptic voters. The results show that these electorates support PRRPs&#8217; nativist welfare positions for very different reasons in the two welfare regimes. First, in the conservative regime, economically exposed citizens vote for PRRPs, the more they stress nativism and welfare expansion. By contrast, in the social-democratic regime this group of voters is more likely to support positions combining nativism and dismantled welfare benefits. Second, immigrant-sceptic voters in the social-democratic regime support PRRPs who pledge to preserve the welfare state, and increased migration considerably boosts the probability that they do so. By contrast, this group of voters in the conservative regime is more likely to support PRRPs who seek to partly dismantle the welfare state, and the inflow of immigrants is unrelated to these choices. These results have important implications and suggest that welfare regimes moderate public opinion differently in the current age of populism compared to previous eras.

        Can non-citizen enfranchisement policies reduce the turnout gap between citizens with an immigration background and native citizen voters? While increasingly common in practice, there are only a handful of studies on the political consequences of non-citizen enfranchisement on voter mobilisation. Here, we examine the impact of non-citizen voting (NCV) rights on the political participation of citizens with and without an immigration background. Focusing on Switzerland, we use high-quality household panel data (SHP) from 1999 to 2014, leveraging both longitudinal and municipal level variation of enfranchisement laws when identifying their effect on turnout. We show that NCV rights boost political participation overall, and it particularly enhances turnout among citizens with an immigration background. Our analysis adds to existing theoretical explanations and empirical debates on representation and political participation in diverse democratic societies with large immigrant populations.

<div class="abstract">
      <p>
        In 2014, the USA initiated the formation of a multilateral military operation against Daesh in Syria and Iraq. Eventually, more than 70 states joined the anti-Daesh coalition. However, contributions to the military effort have been characterized by great variance, especially among EU member states. While some states took leading roles in the airstrikes, others provided training for Iraqi and Kurdish forces, and still others did not get involved beyond voicing their support for the policy. Against this backdrop, this article makes a two-fold contribution to the literature on military coalitions and security policy. Empirically, the article provides a mapping of the then 28 EU member states&#8217; military engagement in the fight against Daesh in Syria and Iraq. Analytically, fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) is applied to account for the observed pattern of military involvement, using an integrative framework that combines international and domestic factors. The results demonstrate that multiple paths led towards EU military involvement in the anti-Daesh coalition. At the same time, international-level incentives, such as external threat and/or alliance value feature prominently in all three identified paths. The analysis further underscores the value of a configurational perspective, because neither an external threat nor alliance value are sufficient on their own to bring about the outcome. Across the set-theoretic configurations, these conditions either combine with other &#8216;push&#8217; factors or with the absence of constraints against military involvement. In line with the latter, the article highlights the policy relevance of institutional constraints, especially legislative veto rights, since most of those countries that were involved in the airstrikes of the anti-Daesh coalition did not have formal parliamentary involvement on matters of military deployment policy.

      To the Editor In an updated Recommendation Statement, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) in asymptomatic patients aged 50 years or older. When deciding whether to screen patients for AF, we encourage clinicians to consider the potential effect of subclinical AF on minoritized populations, including racial and ethnic minoritized groups such as American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, and Hispanic or Latino populations.

      A new data retrieval approach utilizing selective staining is explored to differentiate &#8220;0&#8221; from &#8220;1&#8221; cells in EEPROM and Flash memory with node sizes of 40 nm and 250 nm. A two-step staining process based on selective oxide etching and copper galvanic displacement deposition is introduced. The underlying mechanism is attributed to the difference in electric field across the tunnel oxide, which originates from the presence or absence of charges stored in the floating gates. With proper sample preparation, the selectively stained and non-stained cells can be characterized with optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, to facilitate direct read-out of data in a time-efficient manner. The physical layout of individual memory cells with respect to the stored data is identified. A systematic data retrieval is achieved with an accuracy of 95% at individual bit level. This selective staining technique marks the data permanently on the chip that allows for subsequent analysis and evidence retention.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      Background clutters pose challenges to defocus blur detection. Existing approaches often produce artifact predictions in background areas with clutter and relatively low confident predictions in boundary areas. In this work, we tackle the above issues from two perspectives. Firstly, inspired by the recent success of self-attention mechanism, we introduce channel-wise and spatial-wise attention modules to attentively aggregate features at different channels and spatial locations to obtain more discriminative features. Secondly, we propose a generative adversarial training strategy to suppress spurious and low reliable predictions. This is achieved by utilizing a discriminator to identify predicted defocus map from ground-truth ones. As such, the defocus network (generator) needs to produce &#8216;realistic&#8217; defocus map to minimize discriminator loss. We further demonstrate that the generative adversarial training allows exploiting additional unlabeled data to improve performance, a.k.a. semi-supervised learning, and we provide the first benchmark on semi-supervised defocus detection. Finally, we demonstrate that the existing evaluation metrics for defocus detection generally fail to quantify the robustness with respect to thresholding. For a fair and practical evaluation, we introduce an effective yet efficient $AUF_beta $ metric. Extensive experiments on three public datasets verify the superiority of the proposed methods compared against state-of-the-art approaches.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      This article investigates the distributed state estimation problem for large-scale power systems with the appearance of bad data. The power system is decomposed into several nonoverlapping agents and these agents interact with each other through transmission lines to form an interconnected multiagent power system (IMAPS). The measurement at each agent is local measurement, and the measurement in transmission line is edge measurement. To obtain an accurate state estimation of each agent in a distributed manner when the measurements are coupled with bad data, a bad data detection process should be designed. The difficulty is how to detect the bad data in edge measurement in a distributed scheme. To solve this problem, the characteristics of the edge measurement residual is analyzed, and a distributed bad data detection strategy is presented based on a novel iterative distributed Kalman-like filter (IDKF). It is proved that the IDKF algorithm can converge in finite steps when the communication graph of the IMAPS is acyclic, and the estimation accuracy is similar to that of the centralized Kalman filter. In addition, the IDKF algorithm shows excellent performance even when bad data appears. Simulation tests conducted on the IEEE 118-bus power system verify the theoretical findings.

      The power produced by a wind turbine depends on environmental conditions, working parameters, and interactions with nearby turbines. However, these aspects are often neglected in the design of data-driven models for wind farms&#8217; performance analysis. In this article, we propose to predict the active power and to provide reliable prediction intervals via ensembles of multivariate polynomial regression models that exploit a higher number of inputs (compared to most approaches in the literature), including operational and thermal variables. We present two main strategies: the former considers the environmental measurements collected at the other wind turbines in the farm as additional modeling information for the turbine under analysis; the latter combines multiple models relative to different operative conditions. We validate our approach on real data from the SCADA system of a wind farm in Italy and obtain a MAE of the order of 1.0% of the rated power of the turbine. Moreover, due to the structure of our approach, we can gain quantitative insights on the covariates most frequently selected depending on the working region of the wind turbines.

Therefore, distributionally robust optimization (DRO) is a good choice because it can provide an adjustable self-scheduling strategy for GENCOs in an uncertain environment, which can balance robustness and economics well compared to strategies derived from robust optimization and stochastic optimization. In this article, a novel moment-based DRO model with conditional value-at-risk is proposed to solve the self-scheduling problem under electricity price uncertainty. The size of the model mainly depends on the system size, and the computational burden increases sharply as the system size increases. For this drawback, two effective approximate models are proposed: one approximate model based on vector splitting (DRA-VS) and another based on the alternate direction multiplier method (DRA-ADMM). Both can greatly reduce calculation time and resources, while ensuring the quality of the solution, and DRA-ADMM only needs the information of the current area in each step of the solution, thus, private information is guaranteed. Simulations of three IEEE test systems are conducted to demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed DRO model and two approximate models.

      Distributed energy sources including renewable energy (RE) sources and electric vehicle (EV) discharging offer opportunities to improve grid performance. Although uncoordinated EV charging can perfectly meet users&#8217; driving needs, it brings great challenges in maintaining the quality of low voltage (LV) distribution grids. Most existing EV control strategies do not take into account the heterogeneous nature of EV charging, including the various users&#8217; travel needs and the intermittent nature of RE sources. This article proposes a hierarchical control method that simultaneously coordinates EV charging by considering a dynamic energy tariff, RE sources, EV hardware characteristics, and particularly the EV&#8217;s driving needs. The proposed local controller sends the EV&#8217;s charging priority and required energy to the central controller based on the EV&#8217;s hardware characteristics and users&#8217; driving needs. The central controller then uses this information along with the energy tariff from the retailer and the present grid performance to control EV&#8217;s charging or discharging power. The efficacy of this hierarchical control method is evaluated using an Australian LV grid. The obtained results show that this method can reduce the neutral current and voltage imbalance with the maximized usage of renewable energy resources while the EV users&#8217; driving needs are met.

<div class="itemdescription">

      Semi-supervised few-shot learning aims to improve the model generalization ability by means of both limited labeled data and widely-available unlabeled data. Previous works attempt to model the relations between the few-shot labeled data and extra unlabeled data, by performing a label propagation or pseudo-labeling process using an episodic training strategy. However, the feature distribution represented by the pseudo-labeled data itself is coarse-grained, meaning that there might be a large distribution gap between the pseudo-labeled data and the real query data. To this end, we propose a sample-centric feature generation (SFG) approach for semi-supervised few-shot image classification. Specifically, the few-shot labeled samples from different classes are initially trained to predict pseudo-labels for the potential unlabeled samples. Next, a semi-supervised meta-generator is utilized to produce derivative features centering around each pseudo-labeled sample, enriching the intra-class feature diversity. Meanwhile, the sample-centric generation constrains the generated features to be compact and close to the pseudo-labeled sample, ensuring the inter-class feature discriminability. Further, a reliability assessment (RA) metric is developed to weaken the influence of generated outliers on model learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed feature generation approach on challenging one- and few-shot image classification benchmarks.

      Protection of the design intellectual property (IP) has become a pertinent need owing to the globalized integrated circuit (IC) supply chain. Logic locking has been perceived as a holistic solution ensuring protection against multiple supply chain entities. The research community has proposed many logic locking techniques, out of which provably-secure logic locking (PSLL) techniques have gathered traction due to their algorithmic and mathematical security guarantees. However, there has been a perpetual cat-and-mouse game between the attackers and the defenders. Although these logic locking techniques are provably secure, they are typically short-lived due to the weaknesses in their hardware/structural implementation that attacks exploit. We attribute this cat-and-mouse game to the lack of a diagnostic tool for PSLL techniques for security-enforcing designers and raise the question, &#8220;Can a designer proactively diagnose the hardware implementation of a PSLL technique for structural vulnerabilities before taking the design to silicon?&#8221; In this work, we first review the recent PSLL techniques to extract generic properties, based on which we develop a first-of-its-kind security diagnostic tool (Valkyrie) that a security-enforcing designer can use to assess the structural vulnerabilities before taking the design to silicon. We also propose a generic circuit-recovery attack, validating the tool results to assure the community that if the tool identifies a vulnerability, it can always be exploited. Thus, our attack acts as a cautionary tale to the designer. We make these claims after verifying the efficacy of our tool and attack on 15 (seven broken and eight unbroken) PSLL techniques for different synthesis tools, technology libraries, and abstraction levels across a dataset of more than 20,000 locked designs. We observe 100% success in all these cases. Our diagnosti- tool (which we open-source) can thus serve as a vehicle to test the structural resilience of the hardware implementation of any newly developed PSLL technique. We envision Valkyrie bringing a much-needed control over the cat-and-mouse game that the PSLL research has been trapped in.

      As cities become smarter, the importance of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) will be increasingly pronounced. To support latency- and time-sensitive applications, there have been attempts to utilize fog-cloud computing in VANETs. There are, however, a number of limitations in existing fog-cloud based VANET deployments, ranging from computation and communication bottlenecks to privacy leakage to costly certificate/ pseudonym management to key escrow, and so on. Therefore, in this paper we propose a privacy-preserving aggregation authentication scheme (PPAAS). The scheme is designed for deployment in a safety warning system for fog-cloud based VANETs. Specifically, the PPAAS scheme is realized using a novel efficient anonymous certificateless aggregation signcryption scheme (CASS) proposed in this paper, and allows a fog node to aggregate signcrypted traffic-related messages from surrounding vehicles into an aggregated ciphertext and unsigncrypt them in a batch. We then evaluate the security of PPAAS and demonstrate that it supports confidentiality, authentication, and (efficient) conditional privacy, and key escrow freeness. In particular, our scheme is the first in the literature to achieve efficient conditional privacy, which avoids the need for costly pseudonym management. We also demonstrate that the scheme is practical, based on our simulation results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">

      This paper presents a new method, named implicit and explicit feature purification (IEFP), for age-invariant face recognition. Facial features extracted from a face image contain the information about the identity, age, and other attributes. For age-invariant face recognition, it is important to remove the irrelevant information, and retain the identity information only, in the facial features. Through the two proposed feature purification mechanisms, our framework can produce facial-feature embeddings that preserve identity information as much as possible and are insensitive to age variations. Specifically, on the one hand, a special network module is devised to implicitly purify the original facial features obtained from a face encoder. On the other hand, to obtain purer facial feature representations for age-invariant face recognition, irrelevant information within the implicitly purified features, such as the age, is further removed. This is realized by using a regularizer, based on information theory, to explicitly minimize the correlation between identity-related features and age-related features. Comprehensive ablation studies show that these two feature purification schemes can work independently, as well as collaboratively, to achieve better performance. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark data sets show that the IEFP method is on par with those competitors learned on far more favorable training samples, and it achieves the best performance in a fair comparison. Furthermore, we provide mathematical interpretation to explain the effectiveness of our approach, and find that it tends to generate low-rank, yet high-dimensional, representations for age-invariant face recognition.

      We propose a privacy-preserving Naive Bayes classifier and apply it to the problem of private text classification. In this setting, a party (Alice) holds a text message, while another party (Bob) holds a classifier. At the end of the protocol, Alice will only learn the result of the classifier applied to her text input and Bob learns nothing. Our solution is based on Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC). Our Rust implementation provides a fast and secure solution for the classification of unstructured text. Applying our solution to the case of spam detection (the solution is generic, and can be used in any other scenario in which the Naive Bayes classifier can be employed), we can classify an SMS as spam or ham in less than 340ms in the case where the dictionary size of Bob&#8217;s model includes all words ( $n = 5200$ ) and Alice&#8217;s SMS has at most $m = 160$ unigrams. In the case with $n = 369$ and $m = 8$ (the average of a spam SMS in the database), our solution takes only 21ms.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      In this paper, we propose a novel method for boundary detection in close-range hyperspectral images. This method can effectively predict the boundaries of objects of similar colour but different materials. To effectively extract the material information in the image, the spatial distribution of the spectral responses of different materials or endmembers is first estimated by hyperspectral unmixing. The resulting abundance map represents the fraction of each endmember spectra at each pixel. The abundance map is used as a supportive feature such that the spectral signature and the abundance vector for each pixel are fused to form a new spectral feature vector. Then different spectral similarity measures are adopted to construct a sparse spectral-spatial affinity matrix that characterizes the similarity between the spectral feature vectors of neighbouring pixels within a local neighborhood. After that, a spectral clustering method is adopted to produce eigenimages. Finally, the boundary map is constructed from the most informative eigenimages. We created a new HSI dataset and use it to compare the proposed method with four alternative methods, one for hyperspectral image and three for RGB image. The results exhibit that our method outperforms the alternatives and can cope with several scenarios that methods based on colour images cannot handle.

      Adaptive prediction is an important tool for efficient compression of non-stationary signals. A common approach to achieve adaptivity is to switch between a set of prediction modes, designed to capture variations in signal statistics. The design poses several challenges including: i) catastrophic instability due to statistical mismatch driven by propagation through the prediction loop, and ii) severe non-convexity of the cost surface that is often riddled with poor local minima. Motivated by these challenges, this paper presents a near-optimal method for designing prediction modes for adaptive compression. The proposed method builds on a stable, open-loop platform, but with a subterfuge that ensures that the design is asymptotically optimized for closed-loop operation. The non-convexity is handled by deterministic annealing, a powerful optimization tool to avoid poor local minima. To demonstrate the impact of the proposed approach on practical applications, we consider adaptive, transform-domain predictor design for enhancing standard video coding. Experimental results validate the benefits of the proposed design in terms of significant performance gains for both predictive compression systems in general and video coding in particular.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">

      Training deep models for RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) often requires a large number of labeled RGB-D images. However, RGB-D data is not easily acquired, which limits the development of RGB-D SOD techniques. To alleviate this issue, we present a Dual-Semi RGB-D Salient Object Detection Network (DS-Net) to leverage unlabeled RGB images for boosting RGB-D saliency detection. We first devise a depth decoupling convolutional neural network (DDCNN), which contains a depth estimation branch and a saliency detection branch. The depth estimation branch is trained with RGB-D images and then used to estimate the pseudo depth maps for all unlabeled RGB images to form the paired data. The saliency detection branch is used to fuse the RGB feature and depth feature to predict the RGB-D saliency. Then, the whole DDCNN is assigned as the backbone in a teacher-student framework for semi-supervised learning. Moreover, we also introduce a consistency loss on the intermediate attention and saliency maps for the unlabeled data, as well as a supervised depth and saliency loss for labeled data. Experimental results on seven widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our DDCNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. We also demonstrate that our semi-supervised DS-Net can further improve the performance, even when using an RGB image with the pseudo depth map.

      Repeatable, convergent outcomes are prima facie evidence for determinism in evolutionary processes. Among fishes, well-known examples include microevolutionary habitat transitions into the water column, where freshwater populations (e.g., sticklebacks, cichlids, and whitefishes) recurrently diverge toward slender-bodied pelagic forms and deep-bodied benthic forms. However, the consequences of such processes at deeper...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Pnas-RssFeedOfEarlyEditionArticles/~4/FgxKzBIPOmc" width="1">
