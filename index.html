<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      We construct a classically verifiable succinct interactive argument for quantum computation (BQP) with communication complexity and verifier runtime that are poly-logarithmic in the runtime of the BQP computation (and polynomial in the security parameter). Our protocol is secure assuming the post-quantum security of indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and Learning with Errors (LWE). This is the first succinct argument for quantum computation in the plain model; prior work (Chia-Chung-Yamakawa, TCC '20) requires both a long common reference string and non-black-box use of a hash function modeled as a random oracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a technical level, we revisit the framework for constructing classically verifiable quantum computation (Mahadev, FOCS '18). We give a self-contained, modular proof of security for Mahadev's protocol, which we believe is of independent interest. Our proof readily generalizes to a setting in which the verifier's first message (which consists of many public keys) is compressed. Next, we formalize this notion of compressed public keys; we view the object as a generalization of constrained/programmable PRFs and instantiate it based on indistinguishability obfuscation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we compile the above protocol into a fully succinct argument using a (sufficiently composable) succinct argument of knowledge for NP. Using our framework, we achieve several additional results, including
    </p>
    <p>
      - Succinct arguments for QMA (given multiple copies of the witness),
    </p>
    <p>
      - Succinct non-interactive arguments for BQP (or QMA) in the quantum random oracle model, and
    </p>
    <p>
      - Succinct batch arguments for BQP (or QMA) assuming post-quantum LWE (without iO).

      Command and control (C&amp;C) is important in an attack. It transfers commands from the attacker to the malware in the compromised hosts. Currently, some attackers use online social networks (OSNs) in C&amp;C tasks. There are two main problems in the C&amp;C on OSNs. First, the process for the malware to find the attacker is reversible. If the malware sample is analyzed by the defender, the attacker would be exposed before publishing the commands. Second, the commands in plain or encrypted form are regarded as abnormal contents by OSNs, which would raise anomalies and trigger restrictions on the attacker. The defender can limit the attacker once it is exposed. In this work, we propose DeepC2, an AI-powered C&amp;C on OSNs, to solve these problems. For the reversible hard-coding, the malware finds the attacker using a neural network model. The attacker's avatars are converted into a batch of feature vectors, and the defender cannot recover the avatars in advance using the model and the feature vectors. To solve the abnormal contents on OSNs, hash collision and text data augmentation are used to embed commands into normal contents. The experiment on Twitter shows that command-embedded tweets can be generated efficiently. The malware can find the attacker covertly on OSNs. Security analysis shows it is hard to recover the attacker's identifiers in advance.

      Smart contract transactions are increasingly interleaved by cross-contract calls. While many tools have been developed to identify a common set of vulnerabilities, the cross-contract vulnerability is overlooked by existing tools. Cross-contract vulnerabilities are exploitable bugs that manifest in the presence of more than two interacting contracts. Existing methods are however limited to analyze a maximum of two contracts at the same time. Detecting cross-contract vulnerabilities is highly non-trivial. With multiple interacting contracts, the search space is much larger than that of a single contract. To address this problem, we present xFuzz, a machine learning guided smart contract fuzzing framework. The machine learning models are trained with novel features (e.g., word vectors and instructions) and are used to filter likely benign program paths. Comparing with existing static tools, machine learning model is proven to be more robust, avoiding directly adopting manually-defined rules in specific tools. We compare xFuzz with three state-of-the-art tools on 7,391 contracts. xFuzz detects 18 exploitable cross-contract vulnerabilities, of which 15 vulnerabilities are exposed for the first time. Furthermore, our approach is shown to be efficient in detecting non-cross-contract vulnerabilities as well -- using less than 20% time as that of other fuzzing tools, xFuzz detects twice as many vulnerabilities.

      Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, are increasingly being used to deliver goods from vendors to customers. To safely conduct these operations at scale, drones are required to broadcast position information as codified in remote identification (remote ID) regulations. However, location broadcast of package delivery drones introduces a privacy risk for customers using these delivery services: Third-party observers may leverage broadcast drone trajectories to link customers with their purchases, potentially resulting in a wide range of privacy risks. We propose a probabilistic definition of privacy risk based on the likelihood of associating a customer to a vendor given a package delivery route. Next, we quantify these risks, enabling drone operators to assess privacy risks when planning delivery routes. We then evaluate the impacts of various factors (e.g., drone capacity) on privacy and consider the trade-offs between privacy and delivery wait times. Finally, we propose heuristics for generating routes with privacy guarantees to avoid exhaustive enumeration of all possible routes and evaluate their performance on several realistic delivery scenarios.

      With the rise of attacks on online accounts in the past years, more and more services offer two-factor authentication for their users. Having factors out of two of the three categories something you know, something you have and something you are should ensure that an attacker cannot compromise two of them at once. Thus, an adversary should not be able to maliciously interact with one's account. However, this is only true if one considers a weak adversary. In particular, since most current solutions only authenticate a session and not individual transactions, they are noneffective if one's device is infected with malware. For online banking, the banking industry has long since identified the need for authenticating transactions. However, specifications of such authentication schemes are not public and implementation details vary wildly from bank to bank with most still being unable to protect against malware. In this work, we present a generic approach to tackle the problem of malicious account takeovers, even in the presence of malware. To this end, we define a new paradigm to improve two-factor authentication that involves the concepts of one-out-of-two security and transaction authentication. Web authentication schemes following this paradigm can protect security-critical transactions against manipulation, even if one of the factors is completely compromised. Analyzing existing authentication schemes, we find that they do not realize one-out-of-two security. We give a blueprint of how to design secure web authentication schemes in general. Based on this blueprint we propose FIDO2 With Two Displays (FIDO2D), a new web authentication scheme based on the FIDO2 standard and prove its security using Tamarin. We hope that our work inspires a new wave of more secure web authentication schemes, which protect security-critical transactions even against attacks with malware.

      The torus (buckle) fracture of the distal radius is one of the most common fractures in children. This fracture is inherently stable and carries an excellent prognosis,1 and several studies have supported the use of a removable splint primarily for symptom relief and discretionary follow-up.2&#8211;5 In The Lancet, Daniel Perry and colleagues6 report the results of a pragmatic randomised trial that was designed to challenge the need for any immobilisation. At 23 emergency departments across the UK, 965 children (379 [39%] female and 586 [61%] male) from age 4 years to 15 years with a torus fracture of the distal radius, were randomly assigned to either an offer of a bandage and no scheduled follow-up (n=489) or rigid immobilisation (cast or splint; n=476) with follow-up as per the standard practice of the treating centre.

      At the midpoint of the 15-year timeline for achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),1 the world is unprepared. The global community arguably has the scientific, technical, and political tools needed to achieve most, if not all, of the 169 SDG targets, yet we are far from the finish line. In 2019, UN Secretary General Ant&#243;nio Guterres warned that global efforts were insufficient and called for radical change.2 Such change never materialised. The COVID-19 pandemic shocked many of the systems needed to achieve the SDGs, revealing deep inequities and the inadequacy of siloed approaches to health and false divides between the education, health, environment, energy, and economic sectors.

      Unsafe abortion contributes substantially to maternal deaths worldwide in countries where safe abortions are not accessible.1 Despite the harms of unsafe abortion, the US Supreme Court draft opinion on Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization showed that the court aims to overturn Roe v Wade and almost 50 years of precedent and the right to safe abortion in the USA.2 If this decision goes into effect, up to 28 states with trigger laws in place, or intentions of passing restrictive legislation, would make abortion effectively illegal and inaccessible.

      Rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) will be increasingly utilized by residential customers due to their economic and environmental benefits. However, the intermittent power produced by PVs and the additional loads required for the PEV charging can cause power quality disturbances in the low-voltage distribution networks (LVDN). An adaptable correlated control (ACC) is proposed for the decoupled optimization of the active and reactive power, where energy cost can be minimized through the local demand-side management (DSM) of residential loads. Further, the optimal allocation of the sparse capacity of inverters for reactive power compensation to maintain the voltage variations and the mitigation of voltage unbalances within the allowable limits is proposed. The proposed ACC provides a supervisory control to observe and modify the voltage quality of the LVDN without the need for real-time collaboration between controllers. The impacts of the integration of installed rooftop PVs and PEV charging for unbalanced three-phase LVDNs are assessed rigorously using a versatile simulation platform. Also, the suitability of the proposed control strategy for DSM and the alleviation of voltage fluctuations and unbalances are assessed.

      To facilitate Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing, smart factories shall flexibly achieve mass manufacture of on-demand individualized products. Reconfigurable multirobot system (MRS)-driven smart factories as a representative paradigm fulfill the above requirements through dynamically adjusting production flows while optimizing productivity and energy efficiency. This article innovates real-time multirobot task allocation to coordinate a heterogeneous MRS so that frequent reconfiguration brought by dynamic production demands can be answered. The challenges brought by frequent production flow adjustment are analyzed and addressed by proposing a hypergraph MRS model and a hypergraph search algorithm. The hypergraph MRS model is tailored to characterize temporal&#8211;spatial features and heterogeneity of the MRS, task assignments of production robots, and transportation paths of transportation robots. The hypergraph search algorithm fulfills the production demands, dual-objective dual-agent optimization of productivity and energy efficiency, and constant time complexity for real-time coordination. Computational experiments show that the proposed approach delivers effective task assignments of optimized MRS productivity and energy efficiency with robust performance.

      Energy Internet (EI) is developing and booming rapidly with the increase of distributed energy resources, which is beneficial to address the severe condition of industrial energy. However, there are inevitable credit crises and utility optimization challenges in EI that need to be settled. In this article, we propose a blockchain-assisted software defined energy Internet (BSDEI), where a distributed energy market smart contract is designed to ensure transactions executed reliably and participants&#8217; accounts dealt accurately. In order to jointly optimize the utilities of operators, retailers, and industrial prosumers in BSDEI, we formulate the whole trading process as a three-stage Stackelberg game, with the proof of existence and uniqueness for the Stackelberg equilibrium. Then, we design a hierarchical distributed policy gradient algorithm to solve the Stackelberg game under incomplete information. We implement a blockchain-based industrial energy trading system using a middleware platform. The smart contract is deployed on the consortium blockchain, providing website interfaces for participants to operate. Furthermore, we conduct experiments for analyzing economic benefits. Our system prototype demonstrates the feasibility of BSDEI and the algorithm exceeds about 18% in total mean reward than comparing algorithms.

      N OWADAYS, billions of devices are connected to the In-ternet, enabling Internet of Things (IoT) systems widely deployed, such as smart city, smart healthcare and intelligent plant, to capture a great quantity of sensing data. Consequently, the data transmission, processing and analysis in IoT applications bring a great pressure to the central server. Fortunately, distributed intelligence becomes one of the potential solutions. Distributed intelligence can greatly relieve server pressures via plenty of terminal devices, and these devices collaboratively perceive and handle the mass data to improve the reliability, s-calability and security of industrial IoT systems. As future IoT system will embrace more wireless sensors and devices, the high-performance computing, high-bandwidth and low-latency communication are excessively required, many new research opportunities and challenges for distributed intelligence over Internet of things have arisen. To promote the development of distributed intelligence technology, this special section (SS) focuses on various technologies and platforms regarding industrial IoT systems. This special section received nearly 50 submitted manuscripts, out of which 10 of them have been accepted after a rigorous peer review. Each manuscript is reviewed by multiple rounds of review with at least three or four reviewers, the problems to be solved and the innovation of each manuscript are mainly concerned. Then the accepted papers are summarized as follows in details. Considering the joint optimization of the offloading decision and resource allocation under limited resource constraints in collaborative edge computing networks with multiple IIoT devices and MEC servers, an improved differential evolution algorithm [7] is proposed to minimize the weighted sum of cost of energy consumption and time delay, which can effectively reduce the system delay and energy consumption. In order to improve the performance of task scheduling in cloud computing- Attiya et al. [1] propose a novel hybrid swarm intelligence method MRFOSSA, which uses a modified Manta-Ray Foraging Optimizer (MRFO) and the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA). MRFOSSA is superior to other methods in terms of makespan time and cloud throughput. The research goal of the paper [5] is to design an intelligent computing offloading strategy for industrial applications in order to optimize costs and mitigate energy losses. Then the paper proposes to combine a fog controller and AI-based learning techniques so that the fog controller can intelligently assign tasks to the most appropriate fog devices and find the appropriate path to the target. Considering the resource utilization efficiency under dynamic overload requests and network states in IIoT, Chen et al. [2] propose DRL-based intelligent SFC orchestration scheme and jointly optimize the VNF deployment and SFC embedment by the improved DDQN algorithm, which can improve the performance of resource utilization rate, execution cost and delay compared with other representative schemes. To solve the problem of resource allocation and energy cost in Internet of Vehicles, Kong et al. [8] design a joint computing and caching framework and formulate the problem as a reinforcement learning problem to minimize the energy cost. On this basis, the optimization algorithm based on DDPG is proposed, which can effectively decrease energy costs. To reduce the query numbers of the object model when constructing adversarial examples, Zhang et al. [10] propose generating adversarial examples with shadow model (GASM), i.e., transfering the query operations to the designed shadow model, which can achieve high attack success rates. Chen et al. [3] revise a Decentralized-Wireless-Federated-Learning algorithm (DWFL) which utilizes the superposition property of the analog scheme. It can solve the problem of single failure, limited bandwidth resource and privacy protection in wireless federated learning algorithm, which can be appli

      Security in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is vital as there are some cases where IIoT devices collect sensory information for crucial social production and life. Thus, designing secure and efficient communication channels is always a research hotspot. However, end devices have memory, computation, and power-supplying capacities limitations. Moreover, perfect forward secrecy (PFS), which means that long-term key exposure still discloses previous session keys, is a critical security property for authentication and key exchange (AKE). This article proposes an AKE protocol named SAKE* for the IIoT environment, where two types of keys (i.e., a master key and an evolution key) guarantee PFS. In addition, the SAKE* protocol merely uses concatenation, XOR, and hash-function operations to achieve lightweight authentication, key exchange, and message integrity. We also compare the SAKE* protocol with seven current and IoT-related authentication protocols regarding security properties and performance. Comparison results indicate that the SAKE* protocol consumes the least computation resource and third-least communication cost among eight AKE protocols while equipping 12 security properties.

      The present article proposes an effective model of synchronous reluctance machines. This model, called the Residual Magnetism (ReMa) model, takes into account not only residual magnetism within the rotor but also that within the stator. Electromotive forces generated by the ReMa model were composed of two frequencies and exhibited similar shapes as those measured in experiments. Resultant equations in a three-phase $(a,b,c)$ frame and in a Park reference frame $(d,q)$ were revealed. The comparison was made with the classical model of synchronous reluctance machine commonly used. Experimental tests were carried out to prove the effectiveness of the ReMa model which was also compared to a classical counterpart in the case where a synchronous reluctance generator was connected to a three-phase diode rectifier.

      An improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on Gaussian distribution model is proposed to realize the autotuning of weighting factors for the cost function design in the model predictive control method. First, the design principle of the weighting factors in model predictive torque control for permanent magnet synchronous motor system is analyzed. Then, using the root mean square of the current error in the two-phase rotating coordinate system and the system switching frequency as references, the objective function of the particles in the PSO is designed by considering the main control goals of reducing the torque ripple, the current total harmonic distortion, and the switching frequency. The Gaussian individual optimal distribution model is used to update the particle position on the structure of the conventional PSO algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method can solve the problem of weighting factors design as it reduces the switching frequency of the system while achieving excellent steady-state performance.

      This article presents a new method for estimating the fault location in a voltage-source-converter-interfaced dc system. The proposed dc fault location estimation method evaluates the distance from the fault point to the dc line terminal by estimating the line inductance; hence, it is designated as $L$ location. Since the fault impedance usually only includes resistance, the proposed $L$ location is less affected by the variation of fault resistance. In addition, the ripple caused by the distributed capacitive discharge is excluded from the dc line current when the proposed $L$ location is applied in the dc system with the distributed-parameter transmission line. The cubic curve-fitting method is used to reconstruct the current signal based on the least squares method. The effectiveness of the proposed $L$ location is verified with an OPAL-RT-based multiterminal dc (MTDC) system and experimental point-to-point and MTDC systems. The comparison with the impedance estimation, the voltage-traveling-wave-based location, and the differential and directional protection substantiates the integral performance of the proposed method

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      The wide bandwidth impedance of grid and inverter are the critical parameters for small-signal stability analysis and control optimization of grid-tied inverter systems. The impedance measurement is an effective way to obtain the grid and inverter impedance by injecting a series of perturbations into the measured system. However, previous studies fail to fully consider the adverse grid voltage conditions; including harmonics, unbalance, frequency deviation, voltage sag, and phase jump; which may bring errors to the measured impedance. In this article, a cascaded delayed signal cancellation (CDSC)-based method is proposed to accurately obtain the impedance of the measured system under adverse grid voltage conditions. The proposed CDSC-based method is mainly composed of the perturbation extraction module (PEM) and frequency adaptive module (FAM). Different CDSC blocks are applied to implement the PEM and FAM to extract the injected perturbations adaptively, under various adverse grid voltage conditions. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiment results are presented to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed impedance measurement method.

      This articledemonstrates the developments toward a high-performance monolithic wheeled structure horizontal dual-axis [pitch (X-axis) and roll (Y-axis)] microelectromechanical system (MEMS) gyroscope based on off-plane coupling suppression silicon gratings. Gyroscopes have been fabricated with a silicon-on-glass fabrication process with vacuum sealed in metal packaging. The featured gyroscope operates in split mode with the bandwidths of two axes devices both of &#8764;70 Hz. By unitizing two individual active restraining control loops that adjust the quadrature amplitude via differentially biasing the silicon gratings in real time, the off-plane mechanical couplings of the two sense modes are significantly reduced by &#8764;95 and &#8764;30 times, which enables &#8764;25-fold and &#8764;56-fold improvements in the bias instability (BI) for a typical dual-axis device. Tactical-grade performances are achieved for both the X-axis and Y-axis gyroscopes with angle random walk of 0.02 deg/&#8730;h and 0.045 deg/&#8730;h along with in-run BI of 0.26 deg/h and 0.65 deg/h, respectively, without any temperature compensation. The current preliminary results show great potential to achieve navigation grade precision by employing the mode-matching technique in the future. The use of silicon gratings for out-of-plane coupling reduction also provides an effective way to build a high-performance planar monolithic chip inertial measurement unit.

        Little is known about whether and under which conditions populist radical right parties&#8217; (PRRPs&#8217;) nativist welfare politics matters to the voters. I address this gap in the research and test the argument that the electoral appeal of this electoral discourse varies among welfare regimes. The study compares the conservative and social-democratic welfare regimes and focuses on the vote choices of the two core constituencies of PRRPs &#8211; economically exposed and immigration-sceptic voters. The results show that these electorates support PRRPs&#8217; nativist welfare positions for very different reasons in the two welfare regimes. First, in the conservative regime, economically exposed citizens vote for PRRPs, the more they stress nativism and welfare expansion. By contrast, in the social-democratic regime this group of voters is more likely to support positions combining nativism and dismantled welfare benefits. Second, immigrant-sceptic voters in the social-democratic regime support PRRPs who pledge to preserve the welfare state, and increased migration considerably boosts the probability that they do so. By contrast, this group of voters in the conservative regime is more likely to support PRRPs who seek to partly dismantle the welfare state, and the inflow of immigrants is unrelated to these choices. These results have important implications and suggest that welfare regimes moderate public opinion differently in the current age of populism compared to previous eras.

        Can non-citizen enfranchisement policies reduce the turnout gap between citizens with an immigration background and native citizen voters? While increasingly common in practice, there are only a handful of studies on the political consequences of non-citizen enfranchisement on voter mobilisation. Here, we examine the impact of non-citizen voting (NCV) rights on the political participation of citizens with and without an immigration background. Focusing on Switzerland, we use high-quality household panel data (SHP) from 1999 to 2014, leveraging both longitudinal and municipal level variation of enfranchisement laws when identifying their effect on turnout. We show that NCV rights boost political participation overall, and it particularly enhances turnout among citizens with an immigration background. Our analysis adds to existing theoretical explanations and empirical debates on representation and political participation in diverse democratic societies with large immigrant populations.

      <p>
        In 2014, the USA initiated the formation of a multilateral military operation against Daesh in Syria and Iraq. Eventually, more than 70 states joined the anti-Daesh coalition. However, contributions to the military effort have been characterized by great variance, especially among EU member states. While some states took leading roles in the airstrikes, others provided training for Iraqi and Kurdish forces, and still others did not get involved beyond voicing their support for the policy. Against this backdrop, this article makes a two-fold contribution to the literature on military coalitions and security policy. Empirically, the article provides a mapping of the then 28 EU member states&#8217; military engagement in the fight against Daesh in Syria and Iraq. Analytically, fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) is applied to account for the observed pattern of military involvement, using an integrative framework that combines international and domestic factors. The results demonstrate that multiple paths led towards EU military involvement in the anti-Daesh coalition. At the same time, international-level incentives, such as external threat and/or alliance value feature prominently in all three identified paths. The analysis further underscores the value of a configurational perspective, because neither an external threat nor alliance value are sufficient on their own to bring about the outcome. Across the set-theoretic configurations, these conditions either combine with other &#8216;push&#8217; factors or with the absence of constraints against military involvement. In line with the latter, the article highlights the policy relevance of institutional constraints, especially legislative veto rights, since most of those countries that were involved in the airstrikes of the anti-Daesh coalition did not have formal parliamentary involvement on matters of military deployment policy.

      <p>
        How do coalitional dynamics matter for the capacity of states to maintain social inclusion in coordinated models of capitalism? Taking its departure in scholarship emphasizing the influence of employers on the extent of state intervention in post-industrial economies, this paper argues that employer influence depends on which actors they team up with &#8211; unions or parties. If unions depend on employers for their organizational influence in a policy field, unions become a strong coalitional partner for employers in weakening demands for inclusiveness from the parliamentary arena. Conversely, if unions have influence independent of any coalition with employers, both unions and employers are likely to team up with political parties aligned with their preferences. This makes the level of inclusion resulting from increased state intervention more fluctuating, depending on who holds government power. A comparative study of reforms of Danish and Austrian vocational education institutions corroborates the empirical purchase of the argument.

      A new data retrieval approach utilizing selective staining is explored to differentiate &#8220;0&#8221; from &#8220;1&#8221; cells in EEPROM and Flash memory with node sizes of 40 nm and 250 nm. A two-step staining process based on selective oxide etching and copper galvanic displacement deposition is introduced. The underlying mechanism is attributed to the difference in electric field across the tunnel oxide, which originates from the presence or absence of charges stored in the floating gates. With proper sample preparation, the selectively stained and non-stained cells can be characterized with optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, to facilitate direct read-out of data in a time-efficient manner. The physical layout of individual memory cells with respect to the stored data is identified. A systematic data retrieval is achieved with an accuracy of 95% at individual bit level. This selective staining technique marks the data permanently on the chip that allows for subsequent analysis and evidence retention.

      Background clutters pose challenges to defocus blur detection. Existing approaches often produce artifact predictions in background areas with clutter and relatively low confident predictions in boundary areas. In this work, we tackle the above issues from two perspectives. Firstly, inspired by the recent success of self-attention mechanism, we introduce channel-wise and spatial-wise attention modules to attentively aggregate features at different channels and spatial locations to obtain more discriminative features. Secondly, we propose a generative adversarial training strategy to suppress spurious and low reliable predictions. This is achieved by utilizing a discriminator to identify predicted defocus map from ground-truth ones. As such, the defocus network (generator) needs to produce &#8216;realistic&#8217; defocus map to minimize discriminator loss. We further demonstrate that the generative adversarial training allows exploiting additional unlabeled data to improve performance, a.k.a. semi-supervised learning, and we provide the first benchmark on semi-supervised defocus detection. Finally, we demonstrate that the existing evaluation metrics for defocus detection generally fail to quantify the robustness with respect to thresholding. For a fair and practical evaluation, we introduce an effective yet efficient $AUF_beta $ metric. Extensive experiments on three public datasets verify the superiority of the proposed methods compared against state-of-the-art approaches.

</p>

      Existing heterogeneous face synthesis (HFS) methods focus on performing accurate image-to-image translation across domains, while they cannot effectively remove the nuisance facial variations such as poses, expressions or occlusions. To address such challenges, this paper studies a new practical heterogeneous prototype learning (HPL) problem. To be specific, given a face image contaminated by facial variations from a source domain, HPL aims to reconstruct the variation-free prototype in a specified target domain. To tackle HPL, we propose a unified and end-to-end framework named bidirectional heterogeneous prototype learning (BHPL). As a bidirectional learning framework, BHPL is able to simultaneously reconstruct the heterogeneous prototypes across source-to-target as well as target-to-source domains. Furthermore, BHPL is capable of learning the identity prototype features for the contaminated face images from both source and target domains in order to perform robust heterogeneous face recognition. BHPL consists of an encoder-decoder structural generator and two dual-task discriminators, which play an adversarial game such that the generator learns the identity prototype feature and generates the cross-domain identity-preserved prototype for each input face image from both domains, and the discriminators accurately predict face identity and distinguish real versus fake prototypes. Empirically studies on multiple heterogeneous face datasets containing facial variations demonstrate the effectiveness of BHPL.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">

      In our daily life, a large number of activities require identity verification, e.g., ePassport gates. Most of those verification systems recognize who you are by matching the ID document photo (ID face) to your live face image (spot face). The ID vs. Spot (IvS) face recognition is different from general face recognition where each dataset usually contains a small number of subjects and sufficient images for each subject. In IvS face recognition, the datasets usually contain massive class numbers (million or more) while each class only has two image samples (one ID face and one spot face), which makes it very challenging to train an effective model (e.g., excessive demand on GPU memory if conducting the classification on such massive classes, hardly capture the effective features for bisample data of each identity, etc.). To avoid the excessive demand on GPU memory, a two-stage training method is developed, where we first train the model on the dataset in general face recognition (e.g., MS-Celeb-1M) and then employ the metric learning losses (e.g., triplet and quadruplet losses) to learn the features on IvS data with million classes. To extract more effective features for IvS face recognition, we propose two novel algorithms to enhance the network by selecting harder samples for training. Firstly, a Cross-Batch Hard Example Mining (CB-HEM) is proposed to select the hard triplets from not only the current mini-batch but also past dozens of mini-batches (for convenience, we use batch to denote a mini-batch in the following), which can significantly expand the space of sample selection. Secondly, a Pseudo Large Batch (PLB) is proposed to virtually increase the batch size with a fixed GPU memory. The proposed PLB and CB-HEM can be employed simultaneously to train the network, which dramatically expands the selecting space by hundreds of times, where the very hard sample pairs especially the hard negative pairs can be selected for training to enhance the discriminative c- pability. Extensive comparative evaluations conducted on multiple IvS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      Semi-supervised few-shot learning aims to improve the model generalization ability by means of both limited labeled data and widely-available unlabeled data. Previous works attempt to model the relations between the few-shot labeled data and extra unlabeled data, by performing a label propagation or pseudo-labeling process using an episodic training strategy. However, the feature distribution represented by the pseudo-labeled data itself is coarse-grained, meaning that there might be a large distribution gap between the pseudo-labeled data and the real query data. To this end, we propose a sample-centric feature generation (SFG) approach for semi-supervised few-shot image classification. Specifically, the few-shot labeled samples from different classes are initially trained to predict pseudo-labels for the potential unlabeled samples. Next, a semi-supervised meta-generator is utilized to produce derivative features centering around each pseudo-labeled sample, enriching the intra-class feature diversity. Meanwhile, the sample-centric generation constrains the generated features to be compact and close to the pseudo-labeled sample, ensuring the inter-class feature discriminability. Further, a reliability assessment (RA) metric is developed to weaken the influence of generated outliers on model learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed feature generation approach on challenging one- and few-shot image classification benchmarks.

      As cities become smarter, the importance of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) will be increasingly pronounced. To support latency- and time-sensitive applications, there have been attempts to utilize fog-cloud computing in VANETs. There are, however, a number of limitations in existing fog-cloud based VANET deployments, ranging from computation and communication bottlenecks to privacy leakage to costly certificate/ pseudonym management to key escrow, and so on. Therefore, in this paper we propose a privacy-preserving aggregation authentication scheme (PPAAS). The scheme is designed for deployment in a safety warning system for fog-cloud based VANETs. Specifically, the PPAAS scheme is realized using a novel efficient anonymous certificateless aggregation signcryption scheme (CASS) proposed in this paper, and allows a fog node to aggregate signcrypted traffic-related messages from surrounding vehicles into an aggregated ciphertext and unsigncrypt them in a batch. We then evaluate the security of PPAAS and demonstrate that it supports confidentiality, authentication, and (efficient) conditional privacy, and key escrow freeness. In particular, our scheme is the first in the literature to achieve efficient conditional privacy, which avoids the need for costly pseudonym management. We also demonstrate that the scheme is practical, based on our simulation results.

      This paper presents a new method, named implicit and explicit feature purification (IEFP), for age-invariant face recognition. Facial features extracted from a face image contain the information about the identity, age, and other attributes. For age-invariant face recognition, it is important to remove the irrelevant information, and retain the identity information only, in the facial features. Through the two proposed feature purification mechanisms, our framework can produce facial-feature embeddings that preserve identity information as much as possible and are insensitive to age variations. Specifically, on the one hand, a special network module is devised to implicitly purify the original facial features obtained from a face encoder. On the other hand, to obtain purer facial feature representations for age-invariant face recognition, irrelevant information within the implicitly purified features, such as the age, is further removed. This is realized by using a regularizer, based on information theory, to explicitly minimize the correlation between identity-related features and age-related features. Comprehensive ablation studies show that these two feature purification schemes can work independently, as well as collaboratively, to achieve better performance. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark data sets show that the IEFP method is on par with those competitors learned on far more favorable training samples, and it achieves the best performance in a fair comparison. Furthermore, we provide mathematical interpretation to explain the effectiveness of our approach, and find that it tends to generate low-rank, yet high-dimensional, representations for age-invariant face recognition.

      We propose a privacy-preserving Naive Bayes classifier and apply it to the problem of private text classification. In this setting, a party (Alice) holds a text message, while another party (Bob) holds a classifier. At the end of the protocol, Alice will only learn the result of the classifier applied to her text input and Bob learns nothing. Our solution is based on Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC). Our Rust implementation provides a fast and secure solution for the classification of unstructured text. Applying our solution to the case of spam detection (the solution is generic, and can be used in any other scenario in which the Naive Bayes classifier can be employed), we can classify an SMS as spam or ham in less than 340ms in the case where the dictionary size of Bob&#8217;s model includes all words ( $n = 5200$ ) and Alice&#8217;s SMS has at most $m = 160$ unigrams. In the case with $n = 369$ and $m = 8$ (the average of a spam SMS in the database), our solution takes only 21ms.

      In this paper, we propose a novel method for boundary detection in close-range hyperspectral images. This method can effectively predict the boundaries of objects of similar colour but different materials. To effectively extract the material information in the image, the spatial distribution of the spectral responses of different materials or endmembers is first estimated by hyperspectral unmixing. The resulting abundance map represents the fraction of each endmember spectra at each pixel. The abundance map is used as a supportive feature such that the spectral signature and the abundance vector for each pixel are fused to form a new spectral feature vector. Then different spectral similarity measures are adopted to construct a sparse spectral-spatial affinity matrix that characterizes the similarity between the spectral feature vectors of neighbouring pixels within a local neighborhood. After that, a spectral clustering method is adopted to produce eigenimages. Finally, the boundary map is constructed from the most informative eigenimages. We created a new HSI dataset and use it to compare the proposed method with four alternative methods, one for hyperspectral image and three for RGB image. The results exhibit that our method outperforms the alternatives and can cope with several scenarios that methods based on colour images cannot handle.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">

      Adaptive prediction is an important tool for efficient compression of non-stationary signals. A common approach to achieve adaptivity is to switch between a set of prediction modes, designed to capture variations in signal statistics. The design poses several challenges including: i) catastrophic instability due to statistical mismatch driven by propagation through the prediction loop, and ii) severe non-convexity of the cost surface that is often riddled with poor local minima. Motivated by these challenges, this paper presents a near-optimal method for designing prediction modes for adaptive compression. The proposed method builds on a stable, open-loop platform, but with a subterfuge that ensures that the design is asymptotically optimized for closed-loop operation. The non-convexity is handled by deterministic annealing, a powerful optimization tool to avoid poor local minima. To demonstrate the impact of the proposed approach on practical applications, we consider adaptive, transform-domain predictor design for enhancing standard video coding. Experimental results validate the benefits of the proposed design in terms of significant performance gains for both predictive compression systems in general and video coding in particular.
