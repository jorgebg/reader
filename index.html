      The privacy of machine learning models has become a significant concern in many emerging Machine-Learning-as-a-Service applications, where prediction services based on well-trained models are offered to users via pay-per-query. The lack of a defense mechanism can impose a high risk on the privacy of the server's model since an adversary could efficiently steal the model by querying only a few `good' data points. The interplay between a server's defense and an adversary's attack inevitably leads to an arms race dilemma, as commonly seen in Adversarial Machine Learning. To study the fundamental tradeoffs between model utility from a benign user's view and privacy from an adversary's view, we develop new metrics to quantify such tradeoffs, analyze their theoretical properties, and develop an optimization problem to understand the optimal adversarial attack and defense strategies. The developed concepts and theory match the empirical findings on the `equilibrium' between privacy and utility. In terms of optimization, the key ingredient that enables our results is a unified representation of the attack-defense problem as a min-max bi-level problem. The developed results will be demonstrated by examples and experiments.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

      In a secret single leader election protocol (SSLE), one of the system members is chosen as a leader and no other member can know who the leader is, unless she decides to reveal herself. Leader-election oracles are known to be instrumental in designing efficient consensus protocols, and one can expect that secret leader election may help in developing long-lived blockchain systems that are secure with respect to the adaptive adversary. In this paper, we introduce secret leader sortition (SLS) that we believe to perfectly match progress and security expectations of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains. An SLS protocol produces an unpredictable permutation of system members that can be fed to an accompanying blockchain protocol in order to ensure deterministic finality. We describe Homomorphic Sortition, an SLS protocol based on Threshold Fully Homomorphic Encryption (ThFHE). An interesting novelty of our protocol is a cryptographic hash function evaluation under ThFHE and, somewhat surprisingly, we show that all ThFHE stimuli required for our protocol can be efficiently and proactively constructed in a parallelizable fashion. In contrast to existing secret leader election protocols, our SLS solution is purely asynchronous and it fairly leverages the stake distribution among the system members: the probability distribution for each position in the permutation is proportional to the stakes of remaining candidates. As we demonstrate, our SLS protocol seamlessly partners with a large family of PoS blockchain implementations.

      Federated learning may be subject to both global aggregation attacks and distributed poisoning attacks. Blockchain technology along with incentive and penalty mechanisms have been suggested to counter these. In this paper, we explore verifiable off-chain computations using zero-knowledge proofs as an alternative to incentive and penalty mechanisms in blockchain-based federated learning. In our solution, learning nodes, in addition to their computational duties, act as off-chain provers submitting proofs to attest computational correctness of parameters that can be verified on the blockchain. We demonstrate and evaluate our solution through a health monitoring use case and proof-of-concept implementation leveraging the ZoKrates language and tools for smart contract-based on-chain model management. Our research introduces verifiability of correctness of learning processes, thus advancing blockchain-based federated learning.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      Federated recommender system (FRS), which enables many local devices to train a shared model jointly without transmitting local raw data, has become a prevalent recommendation paradigm with privacy-preserving advantages. However, previous work on FRS performs similarity search via inner product in continuous embedding space, which causes an efficiency bottleneck when the scale of items is extremely large. We argue that such a scheme in federated settings ignores the limited capacities in resource-constrained user devices (i.e., storage space, computational overhead, and communication bandwidth), and makes it harder to be deployed in large-scale recommender systems. Besides, it has been shown that the transmission of local gradients in real-valued form between server and clients may leak users' private information. To this end, we propose a lightweight federated recommendation framework with privacy-preserving matrix factorization, LightFR, that is able to generate high-quality binary codes by exploiting learning to hash techniques under federated settings, and thus enjoys both fast online inference and economic memory consumption. Moreover, we devise an efficient federated discrete optimization algorithm to collaboratively train model parameters between the server and clients, which can effectively prevent real-valued gradient attacks from malicious parties. Through extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, we show that our LightFR model outperforms several state-of-the-art FRS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy, inference efficiency and data privacy.

      Copy detection patterns (CDP) are an attractive technology that allows manufacturers to defend their products against counterfeiting. The main assumption behind the protection mechanism of CDP is that these codes printed with the smallest symbol size (1x1) on an industrial printer cannot be copied or cloned with sufficient accuracy due to data processing inequality. However, previous works have shown that Machine Learning (ML) based attacks can produce high-quality fakes, resulting in decreased accuracy of authentication based on traditional feature-based authentication systems. While Deep Learning (DL) can be used as a part of the authentication system, to the best of our knowledge, none of the previous works has studied the performance of a DL-based authentication system against ML-based attacks on CDP with 1x1 symbol size. In this work, we study such a performance assuming a supervised learning (SL) setting.

      Christopher J L Murray and colleagues1 provide a compelling contribution to the understanding of the burden of disease attributable to bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in 2019. Focusing on 23 bacterial pathogens, they used two-stage spatiotemporal modelling to estimate this burden to be larger than diseases such as HIV and malaria, with the highest rates in sub-Saharan Africa. This new information should raise this issue higher on the global health agenda. They also, however, highlight the scarcity of high-quality data for infectious diseases and antibiotic consumption, with the authors having to rely on antibiotics sales data for an indication of antibiotic consumption.

      Christopher J L Murray and colleagues1 report on the dramatically high burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) worldwide, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. The authors also emphasise the insufficient data on the prevalence of bacterial infections and AMR in low-resource settings. Although the figures presented are striking, they do not sufficiently depict the suffering of patients living in these locations and the frustration of clinicians unable to treat an infection that is typically easily curable elsewhere.

      In Reply Dr Wirta&#8217;s Letter discusses varenicline nasal spray as a potential treatment option for dry eye disease. This drug, which was approved after submission of our clinical update, is an exciting addition to the current armamentarium of therapies for dry eye disease. The goal of our article was to provide an overview of the pathophysiology of dry eye disease, an approach to evaluating patients, and a review of current treatment strategies for clinicians practicing outside the field of ophthalmology. Therefore, we felt that discussion of pipeline treatments and those under investigation was beyond the scope of our article. Additionally, we agree that effective management of dry eye disease requires recognition of the multifactorial and complex nature of this condition and that treatment strategies must be tailored for each individual patient.

However, the intermittent power produced by PVs and the additional loads required for the PEV charging can cause power quality disturbances in the low-voltage distribution networks (LVDN). An adaptable correlated control (ACC) is proposed for the decoupled optimization of the active and reactive power, where energy cost can be minimized through the local demand-side management (DSM) of residential loads. Further, the optimal allocation of the sparse capacity of inverters for reactive power compensation to maintain the voltage variations and the mitigation of voltage unbalances within the allowable limits is proposed. The proposed ACC provides a supervisory control to observe and modify the voltage quality of the LVDN without the need for real-time collaboration between controllers. The impacts of the integration of installed rooftop PVs and PEV charging for unbalanced three-phase LVDNs are assessed rigorously using a versatile simulation platform. Also, the suitability of the proposed control strategy for DSM and the alleviation of voltage fluctuations and unbalances are assessed.

      Energy Internet (EI) is developing and booming rapidly with the increase of distributed energy resources, which is beneficial to address the severe condition of industrial energy. However, there are inevitable credit crises and utility optimization challenges in EI that need to be settled. In this article, we propose a blockchain-assisted software defined energy Internet (BSDEI), where a distributed energy market smart contract is designed to ensure transactions executed reliably and participants&#8217; accounts dealt accurately. In order to jointly optimize the utilities of operators, retailers, and industrial prosumers in BSDEI, we formulate the whole trading process as a three-stage Stackelberg game, with the proof of existence and uniqueness for the Stackelberg equilibrium. Then, we design a hierarchical distributed policy gradient algorithm to solve the Stackelberg game under incomplete information. We implement a blockchain-based industrial energy trading system using a middleware platform. The smart contract is deployed on the consortium blockchain, providing website interfaces for participants to operate. Furthermore, we conduct experiments for analyzing economic benefits. Our system prototype demonstrates the feasibility of BSDEI and the algorithm exceeds about 18% in total mean reward than comparing algorithms.

      N OWADAYS, billions of devices are connected to the In-ternet, enabling Internet of Things (IoT) systems widely deployed, such as smart city, smart healthcare and intelligent plant, to capture a great quantity of sensing data. Consequently, the data transmission, processing and analysis in IoT applications bring a great pressure to the central server. Fortunately, distributed intelligence becomes one of the potential solutions. Distributed intelligence can greatly relieve server pressures via plenty of terminal devices, and these devices collaboratively perceive and handle the mass data to improve the reliability, s-calability and security of industrial IoT systems. As future IoT system will embrace more wireless sensors and devices, the high-performance computing, high-bandwidth and low-latency communication are excessively required, many new research opportunities and challenges for distributed intelligence over Internet of things have arisen. To promote the development of distributed intelligence technology, this special section (SS) focuses on various technologies and platforms regarding industrial IoT systems. This special section received nearly 50 submitted manuscripts, out of which 10 of them have been accepted after a rigorous peer review. Each manuscript is reviewed by multiple rounds of review with at least three or four reviewers, the problems to be solved and the innovation of each manuscript are mainly concerned. Then the accepted papers are summarized as follows in details. Considering the joint optimization of the offloading decision and resource allocation under limited resource constraints in collaborative edge computing networks with multiple IIoT devices and MEC servers, an improved differential evolution algorithm [7] is proposed to minimize the weighted sum of cost of energy consumption and time delay, which can effectively reduce the system delay and energy consumption. In order to improve the performance of task scheduling in cloud computing- Attiya et al. [1] propose a novel hybrid swarm intelligence method MRFOSSA, which uses a modified Manta-Ray Foraging Optimizer (MRFO) and the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA). MRFOSSA is superior to other methods in terms of makespan time and cloud throughput. The research goal of the paper [5] is to design an intelligent computing offloading strategy for industrial applications in order to optimize costs and mitigate energy losses. Then the paper proposes to combine a fog controller and AI-based learning techniques so that the fog controller can intelligently assign tasks to the most appropriate fog devices and find the appropriate path to the target. Considering the resource utilization efficiency under dynamic overload requests and network states in IIoT, Chen et al. [2] propose DRL-based intelligent SFC orchestration scheme and jointly optimize the VNF deployment and SFC embedment by the improved DDQN algorithm, which can improve the performance of resource utilization rate, execution cost and delay compared with other representative schemes. To solve the problem of resource allocation and energy cost in Internet of Vehicles, Kong et al. [8] design a joint computing and caching framework and formulate the problem as a reinforcement learning problem to minimize the energy cost. On this basis, the optimization algorithm based on DDPG is proposed, which can effectively decrease energy costs. To reduce the query numbers of the object model when constructing adversarial examples, Zhang et al. [10] propose generating adversarial examples with shadow model (GASM), i.e., transfering the query operations to the designed shadow model, which can achieve high attack success rates. Chen et al. [3] revise a Decentralized-Wireless-Federated-Learning algorithm (DWFL) which utilizes the superposition property of the analog scheme. It can solve the problem of single failure, limited bandwidth resource and privacy protection in wireless federated learning algorithm, which can be appli

      This article studies decentralized federated learning algorithms in wireless IoT networks. The traditional parameter server architecture for federated learning faces some problems such as low fault tolerance, large communication overhead and inaccessibility of private data. To solve these problems, we propose a decentralized wireless federated learning algorithm called DWFL. The algorithm works in a system where the workers are organized in a peer-to-peer and server-less manner, and the workers exchange their privacy preserving data with the analog transmission scheme over wireless channels in parallel. With rigorous analysis, we show that DWFL satisfies $(epsilon,delta)$-differential privacy and the privacy budget per worker scales as $mathcal {O}(frac{1}{sqrt{N}})$, in contrast with the constant budget in the orthogonal transmission approach. Furthermore, DWFL converges at the same rate of $mathcal {O}(sqrt{frac{1}{TN}})$ as the best known centralized algorithm with a central parameter server. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our algorithm DWFL also performs well in real settings.

      Security in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is vital as there are some cases where IIoT devices collect sensory information for crucial social production and life. Thus, designing secure and efficient communication channels is always a research hotspot. However, end devices have memory, computation, and power-supplying capacities limitations. Moreover, perfect forward secrecy (PFS), which means that long-term key exposure still discloses previous session keys, is a critical security property for authentication and key exchange (AKE). This article proposes an AKE protocol named SAKE* for the IIoT environment, where two types of keys (i.e., a master key and an evolution key) guarantee PFS. In addition, the SAKE* protocol merely uses concatenation, XOR, and hash-function operations to achieve lightweight authentication, key exchange, and message integrity. We also compare the SAKE* protocol with seven current and IoT-related authentication protocols regarding security properties and performance. Comparison results indicate that the SAKE* protocol consumes the least computation resource and third-least communication cost among eight AKE protocols while equipping 12 security properties.

      The present article proposes an effective model of synchronous reluctance machines. This model, called the Residual Magnetism (ReMa) model, takes into account not only residual magnetism within the rotor but also that within the stator. Electromotive forces generated by the ReMa model were composed of two frequencies and exhibited similar shapes as those measured in experiments. Resultant equations in a three-phase $(a,b,c)$ frame and in a Park reference frame $(d,q)$ were revealed. The comparison was made with the classical model of synchronous reluctance machine commonly used. Experimental tests were carried out to prove the effectiveness of the ReMa model which was also compared to a classical counterpart in the case where a synchronous reluctance generator was connected to a three-phase diode rectifier.

      An improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on Gaussian distribution model is proposed to realize the autotuning of weighting factors for the cost function design in the model predictive control method. First, the design principle of the weighting factors in model predictive torque control for permanent magnet synchronous motor system is analyzed. Then, using the root mean square of the current error in the two-phase rotating coordinate system and the system switching frequency as references, the objective function of the particles in the PSO is designed by considering the main control goals of reducing the torque ripple, the current total harmonic distortion, and the switching frequency. The Gaussian individual optimal distribution model is used to update the particle position on the structure of the conventional PSO algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method can solve the problem of weighting factors design as it reduces the switching frequency of the system while achieving excellent steady-state performance.

</p>

      Recently, model-based predictive current control (MB-PCC) has been presented as a good alternative to classical control algorithms in terms of simplicity and performance reliability. However, MB-PCC suffers from the high dependence on system parameters, which may deteriorate its performance under parameters variations. On the other hand, synchronous reluctance motors (SynRMs) are susceptible to suffer from inductances variations due to the magnetic saturation. Accordingly, in this article a new model-free predictive current control of SynRMs based on a recurrent neural network (RNN-PCC) is developed and proposed. The proposed RNN-PCC relies on the identification of the SynRM currents without considering any parameters. Simulation and experimental results show that both RNN-PCC and MB-PCC have similarly excellent dynamics, while better control performance and tracking errors can be achieved thanks to the proposed RNN-PCC.

      Due to a short-time gap breakdown in electrical discharge machining (EDM), a high dynamic response and flexible discharge current control ability are required for a pulse power generator. Therefore, a one-cycle control(OCC) of output current for a buck-type EDM pulse power generator is proposed. Considering the inductor current operating state, a full-range OCC current control is presented, and the Taylor expansion method is used for the duty cycle calculation. A duty cycle optimization strategy is proposed for transient states. Based on the small signal modeling, the dynamic response ability of the system is analyzed. The discharge current can switch from many transient states to a steady state in a few switching cycles without a current overshoot, and follow the average current reference well in the steady state.

</p>

      The wide bandwidth impedance of grid and inverter are the critical parameters for small-signal stability analysis and control optimization of grid-tied inverter systems. The impedance measurement is an effective way to obtain the grid and inverter impedance by injecting a series of perturbations into the measured system. However, previous studies fail to fully consider the adverse grid voltage conditions; including harmonics, unbalance, frequency deviation, voltage sag, and phase jump; which may bring errors to the measured impedance. In this article, a cascaded delayed signal cancellation (CDSC)-based method is proposed to accurately obtain the impedance of the measured system under adverse grid voltage conditions. The proposed CDSC-based method is mainly composed of the perturbation extraction module (PEM) and frequency adaptive module (FAM). Different CDSC blocks are applied to implement the PEM and FAM to extract the injected perturbations adaptively, under various adverse grid voltage conditions. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiment results are presented to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed impedance measurement method.

        Social influence among people is widely understood to be a universal component of the human experience. However, studies of political behavior have generally approached social influence as specific to a type of behavior, such as voting, in a particular national context. There are good reasons to expect that social influence is observable across diverse behaviors and national contexts. In this study, we test this expectation using a two-wave panel survey of national samples in 19 countries. We employ autoregressive models that address some of the endogeneity challenges associated with attempts to measure social influence with survey designs. Our measure of social influence is predictive of diverse political behaviors in many countries with average effects comparable in size to important standard predictors of behavior.

        Little is known about whether and under which conditions populist radical right parties&#8217; (PRRPs&#8217;) nativist welfare politics matters to the voters. I address this gap in the research and test the argument that the electoral appeal of this electoral discourse varies among welfare regimes. The study compares the conservative and social-democratic welfare regimes and focuses on the vote choices of the two core constituencies of PRRPs &#8211; economically exposed and immigration-sceptic voters. The results show that these electorates support PRRPs&#8217; nativist welfare positions for very different reasons in the two welfare regimes. First, in the conservative regime, economically exposed citizens vote for PRRPs, the more they stress nativism and welfare expansion. By contrast, in the social-democratic regime this group of voters is more likely to support positions combining nativism and dismantled welfare benefits. Second, immigrant-sceptic voters in the social-democratic regime support PRRPs who pledge to preserve the welfare state, and increased migration considerably boosts the probability that they do so. By contrast, this group of voters in the conservative regime is more likely to support PRRPs who seek to partly dismantle the welfare state, and the inflow of immigrants is unrelated to these choices. These results have important implications and suggest that welfare regimes moderate public opinion differently in the current age of populism compared to previous eras.

        Can non-citizen enfranchisement policies reduce the turnout gap between citizens with an immigration background and native citizen voters? While increasingly common in practice, there are only a handful of studies on the political consequences of non-citizen enfranchisement on voter mobilisation. Here, we examine the impact of non-citizen voting (NCV) rights on the political participation of citizens with and without an immigration background. Focusing on Switzerland, we use high-quality household panel data (SHP) from 1999 to 2014, leveraging both longitudinal and municipal level variation of enfranchisement laws when identifying their effect on turnout. We show that NCV rights boost political participation overall, and it particularly enhances turnout among citizens with an immigration background. Our analysis adds to existing theoretical explanations and empirical debates on representation and political participation in diverse democratic societies with large immigrant populations.

        In 2014, the USA initiated the formation of a multilateral military operation against Daesh in Syria and Iraq. Eventually, more than 70 states joined the anti-Daesh coalition. However, contributions to the military effort have been characterized by great variance, especially among EU member states. While some states took leading roles in the airstrikes, others provided training for Iraqi and Kurdish forces, and still others did not get involved beyond voicing their support for the policy. Against this backdrop, this article makes a two-fold contribution to the literature on military coalitions and security policy. Empirically, the article provides a mapping of the then 28 EU member states&#8217; military engagement in the fight against Daesh in Syria and Iraq. Analytically, fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) is applied to account for the observed pattern of military involvement, using an integrative framework that combines international and domestic factors. The results demonstrate that multiple paths led towards EU military involvement in the anti-Daesh coalition. At the same time, international-level incentives, such as external threat and/or alliance value feature prominently in all three identified paths. The analysis further underscores the value of a configurational perspective, because neither an external threat nor alliance value are sufficient on their own to bring about the outcome. Across the set-theoretic configurations, these conditions either combine with other &#8216;push&#8217; factors or with the absence of constraints against military involvement. In line with the latter, the article highlights the policy relevance of institutional constraints, especially legislative veto rights, since most of those countries that were involved in the airstrikes of the anti-Daesh coalition did not have formal parliamentary involvement on matters of military deployment policy.

      A new data retrieval approach utilizing selective staining is explored to differentiate &#8220;0&#8221; from &#8220;1&#8221; cells in EEPROM and Flash memory with node sizes of 40 nm and 250 nm. A two-step staining process based on selective oxide etching and copper galvanic displacement deposition is introduced. The underlying mechanism is attributed to the difference in electric field across the tunnel oxide, which originates from the presence or absence of charges stored in the floating gates. With proper sample preparation, the selectively stained and non-stained cells can be characterized with optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, to facilitate direct read-out of data in a time-efficient manner. The physical layout of individual memory cells with respect to the stored data is identified. A systematic data retrieval is achieved with an accuracy of 95% at individual bit level. This selective staining technique marks the data permanently on the chip that allows for subsequent analysis and evidence retention.

</p>

<p>
      Background clutters pose challenges to defocus blur detection. Existing approaches often produce artifact predictions in background areas with clutter and relatively low confident predictions in boundary areas. In this work, we tackle the above issues from two perspectives. Firstly, inspired by the recent success of self-attention mechanism, we introduce channel-wise and spatial-wise attention modules to attentively aggregate features at different channels and spatial locations to obtain more discriminative features. Secondly, we propose a generative adversarial training strategy to suppress spurious and low reliable predictions. This is achieved by utilizing a discriminator to identify predicted defocus map from ground-truth ones. As such, the defocus network (generator) needs to produce &#8216;realistic&#8217; defocus map to minimize discriminator loss. We further demonstrate that the generative adversarial training allows exploiting additional unlabeled data to improve performance, a.k.a. semi-supervised learning, and we provide the first benchmark on semi-supervised defocus detection. Finally, we demonstrate that the existing evaluation metrics for defocus detection generally fail to quantify the robustness with respect to thresholding. For a fair and practical evaluation, we introduce an effective yet efficient $AUF_beta $ metric. Extensive experiments on three public datasets verify the superiority of the proposed methods compared against state-of-the-art approaches.

      Existing heterogeneous face synthesis (HFS) methods focus on performing accurate image-to-image translation across domains, while they cannot effectively remove the nuisance facial variations such as poses, expressions or occlusions. To address such challenges, this paper studies a new practical heterogeneous prototype learning (HPL) problem. To be specific, given a face image contaminated by facial variations from a source domain, HPL aims to reconstruct the variation-free prototype in a specified target domain. To tackle HPL, we propose a unified and end-to-end framework named bidirectional heterogeneous prototype learning (BHPL). As a bidirectional learning framework, BHPL is able to simultaneously reconstruct the heterogeneous prototypes across source-to-target as well as target-to-source domains. Furthermore, BHPL is capable of learning the identity prototype features for the contaminated face images from both source and target domains in order to perform robust heterogeneous face recognition. BHPL consists of an encoder-decoder structural generator and two dual-task discriminators, which play an adversarial game such that the generator learns the identity prototype feature and generates the cross-domain identity-preserved prototype for each input face image from both domains, and the discriminators accurately predict face identity and distinguish real versus fake prototypes. Empirically studies on multiple heterogeneous face datasets containing facial variations demonstrate the effectiveness of BHPL.

      Immutability has been widely accepted as a fundamental property protecting the security of blockchain technology. However, this property impedes the development of blockchain because of the abuse of blockchain storage and legal obligations. To mitigate this issue, a novel construction of blockchain, called redactable blockchain, was introduced. It enables a central authority to issue the rewriting privilege to a particular party who can rewrite a registered object, e.g., a block or a transaction, in a controlled way. Unfortunately, the central authority must be fully trusted and is an obvious target suffering from various attacks. In this paper, we introduce a redactable blockchain controlled at a fine-grained level in a decentralized setting. In our solution, the rewriting privilege is issued by multiple authorities for reducing the vulnerability of the centralized setting. To formalize our solution, we introduce a novel cryptographic notion, called decentralized policy-based chameleon hash (DPCH), with the formal definition and security model. By applying several simple cryptographic tools, such as chameleon hash, digital signature, and multi-authority attribute-based encryption, we present the generic construction of DPCH along with rigorous security proofs. By applying RSA-based chameleon hash and BLS short signature, we give a practical instantiation of DPCH with performance evaluation. The comprehensive evaluation shows that our solution has superior performance than the state-of-the-art solution.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      Semi-supervised few-shot learning aims to improve the model generalization ability by means of both limited labeled data and widely-available unlabeled data. Previous works attempt to model the relations between the few-shot labeled data and extra unlabeled data, by performing a label propagation or pseudo-labeling process using an episodic training strategy. However, the feature distribution represented by the pseudo-labeled data itself is coarse-grained, meaning that there might be a large distribution gap between the pseudo-labeled data and the real query data. To this end, we propose a sample-centric feature generation (SFG) approach for semi-supervised few-shot image classification. Specifically, the few-shot labeled samples from different classes are initially trained to predict pseudo-labels for the potential unlabeled samples. Next, a semi-supervised meta-generator is utilized to produce derivative features centering around each pseudo-labeled sample, enriching the intra-class feature diversity. Meanwhile, the sample-centric generation constrains the generated features to be compact and close to the pseudo-labeled sample, ensuring the inter-class feature discriminability. Further, a reliability assessment (RA) metric is developed to weaken the influence of generated outliers on model learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed feature generation approach on challenging one- and few-shot image classification benchmarks.

      As cities become smarter, the importance of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) will be increasingly pronounced. To support latency- and time-sensitive applications, there have been attempts to utilize fog-cloud computing in VANETs. There are, however, a number of limitations in existing fog-cloud based VANET deployments, ranging from computation and communication bottlenecks to privacy leakage to costly certificate/ pseudonym management to key escrow, and so on. Therefore, in this paper we propose a privacy-preserving aggregation authentication scheme (PPAAS). The scheme is designed for deployment in a safety warning system for fog-cloud based VANETs. Specifically, the PPAAS scheme is realized using a novel efficient anonymous certificateless aggregation signcryption scheme (CASS) proposed in this paper, and allows a fog node to aggregate signcrypted traffic-related messages from surrounding vehicles into an aggregated ciphertext and unsigncrypt them in a batch. We then evaluate the security of PPAAS and demonstrate that it supports confidentiality, authentication, and (efficient) conditional privacy, and key escrow freeness. In particular, our scheme is the first in the literature to achieve efficient conditional privacy, which avoids the need for costly pseudonym management. We also demonstrate that the scheme is practical, based on our simulation results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">

      This paper presents a new method, named implicit and explicit feature purification (IEFP), for age-invariant face recognition. Facial features extracted from a face image contain the information about the identity, age, and other attributes. For age-invariant face recognition, it is important to remove the irrelevant information, and retain the identity information only, in the facial features. Through the two proposed feature purification mechanisms, our framework can produce facial-feature embeddings that preserve identity information as much as possible and are insensitive to age variations. Specifically, on the one hand, a special network module is devised to implicitly purify the original facial features obtained from a face encoder. On the other hand, to obtain purer facial feature representations for age-invariant face recognition, irrelevant information within the implicitly purified features, such as the age, is further removed. This is realized by using a regularizer, based on information theory, to explicitly minimize the correlation between identity-related features and age-related features. Comprehensive ablation studies show that these two feature purification schemes can work independently, as well as collaboratively, to achieve better performance. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark data sets show that the IEFP method is on par with those competitors learned on far more favorable training samples, and it achieves the best performance in a fair comparison. Furthermore, we provide mathematical interpretation to explain the effectiveness of our approach, and find that it tends to generate low-rank, yet high-dimensional, representations for age-invariant face recognition.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      In this paper, we propose a novel method for boundary detection in close-range hyperspectral images. This method can effectively predict the boundaries of objects of similar colour but different materials. To effectively extract the material information in the image, the spatial distribution of the spectral responses of different materials or endmembers is first estimated by hyperspectral unmixing. The resulting abundance map represents the fraction of each endmember spectra at each pixel. The abundance map is used as a supportive feature such that the spectral signature and the abundance vector for each pixel are fused to form a new spectral feature vector. Then different spectral similarity measures are adopted to construct a sparse spectral-spatial affinity matrix that characterizes the similarity between the spectral feature vectors of neighbouring pixels within a local neighborhood. After that, a spectral clustering method is adopted to produce eigenimages. Finally, the boundary map is constructed from the most informative eigenimages. We created a new HSI dataset and use it to compare the proposed method with four alternative methods, one for hyperspectral image and three for RGB image. The results exhibit that our method outperforms the alternatives and can cope with several scenarios that methods based on colour images cannot handle.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">

      Adaptive prediction is an important tool for efficient compression of non-stationary signals. A common approach to achieve adaptivity is to switch between a set of prediction modes, designed to capture variations in signal statistics. The design poses several challenges including: i) catastrophic instability due to statistical mismatch driven by propagation through the prediction loop, and ii) severe non-convexity of the cost surface that is often riddled with poor local minima. Motivated by these challenges, this paper presents a near-optimal method for designing prediction modes for adaptive compression. The proposed method builds on a stable, open-loop platform, but with a subterfuge that ensures that the design is asymptotically optimized for closed-loop operation. The non-convexity is handled by deterministic annealing, a powerful optimization tool to avoid poor local minima. To demonstrate the impact of the proposed approach on practical applications, we consider adaptive, transform-domain predictor design for enhancing standard video coding. Experimental results validate the benefits of the proposed design in terms of significant performance gains for both predictive compression systems in general and video coding in particular.

<div class="itemdescription">

      Existing Quality Assessment (QA) algorithms consider identifying &#8220;black-holes&#8221; to assess perceptual quality of 3D-synthesized views. However, advancements in rendering and inpainting techniques have made black-hole artifacts near obsolete. Further, 3D-synthesized views frequently suffer from stretching artifacts due to occlusion that in turn affect perceptual quality. Existing QA algorithms are found to be inefficient in identifying these artifacts, as has been seen by their performance on the IETR dataset. We found, empirically, that there is a relationship between the number of blocks with stretching artifacts in view and the overall perceptual quality. Building on this observation, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based algorithm that identifies the blocks with stretching artifacts and incorporates the number of blocks with the stretching artifacts to predict the quality of 3D-synthesized views. To address the challenge with existing 3D-synthesized views dataset, which has few samples, we collect images from other related datasets to increase the sample size and increase generalization while training our proposed CNN-based algorithm. The proposed algorithm identifies blocks with stretching distortions and subsequently fuses them to predict perceptual quality without reference, achieving improvement in performance compared to existing no-reference QA algorithms that are not trained on the IETR dataset. The proposed algorithm can also identify the blocks with stretching artifacts efficiently, which can further be used in downstream applications to improve the quality of 3D views.

      Repeatable, convergent outcomes are prima facie evidence for determinism in evolutionary processes. Among fishes, well-known examples include microevolutionary habitat transitions into the water column, where freshwater populations (e.g., sticklebacks, cichlids, and whitefishes) recurrently diverge toward slender-bodied pelagic forms and deep-bodied benthic forms. However, the consequences of such processes at deeper...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Pnas-RssFeedOfEarlyEditionArticles/~4/FgxKzBIPOmc" width="1">
