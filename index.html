      The transition from paper-based information to Electronic-Health-Records (EHRs) has driven various advancements in the modern healthcare-industry. In many cases, patients need to share their EHR with healthcare professionals. Given the sensitive and security-critical nature of EHRs, it is essential to consider the security and privacy issues of storing and sharing EHR. However, existing security solutions excessively encrypt the whole database, thus requiring the entire database to be decrypted for each access request, which is a time-consuming process. On the other hand, the use of EHR for medical research (e.g., development of precision-medicine, diagnostics-techniques), as well as optimisation of practices in healthcare organisations, requires the EHR to be analysed, and for that, they should be easily accessible without compromising the privacy of the patient. In this paper, we propose an efficient technique called E-Tenon that not only securely keeps all EHR publicly accessible but also provides the desirable security features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in which an Open Database is used for protecting EHR. The proposed E-Tenon empowers patients to securely share their EHR under multi-level, fine-grained access policies defined by themselves. Analyses show that our system outperforms existing solutions in terms of computational-complexity.

      In federated learning (FL), a set of participants share updates computed on their local data with an aggregator server that combines updates into a global model. However, reconciling accuracy with privacy and security is a challenge to FL. On the one hand, good updates sent by honest participants may reveal their private local information, whereas poisoned updates sent by malicious participants may compromise the model's availability and/or integrity. On the other hand, enhancing privacy via update distortion damages accuracy, whereas doing so via update aggregation damages security because it does not allow the server to filter out individual poisoned updates. To tackle the accuracy-privacy-security conflict, we propose {\em fragmented federated learning} (FFL), in which participants randomly exchange and mix fragments of their updates before sending them to the server. To achieve privacy, we design a lightweight protocol that allows participants to privately exchange and mix encrypted fragments of their updates so that the server can neither obtain individual updates nor link them to their originators. To achieve security, we design a reputation-based defense tailored for FFL that builds trust in participants and their mixed updates based on the quality of the fragments they exchange and the mixed updates they send. Since the exchanged fragments' parameters keep their original coordinates and attackers can be neutralized, the server can correctly reconstruct a global model from the received mixed updates without accuracy loss. Experiments on four real data sets show that FFL can prevent semi-honest servers from mounting privacy attacks, can effectively counter poisoning attacks and can keep the accuracy of the global model.

      In this paper, we study the problem of the 1-of-2 string oblivious transfer (OT) between Alice and Bob in the presence of a passive eavesdropper Eve. The eavesdropper Eve is not allowed to get any information about the private data of Alice and Bob. When Alice and Bob are honest-but-curious users, we propose a protocol to achieve 1-private (neither Alice nor Bob would collude with Eve) OT capacity of the binary broadcast symmetric erasure channel, in which the channel provides dependent erasure patterns to Bob and Eve. We find that when the erasure probabilities satisfy certain conditions, the derived lower and upper bounds on the wiretapped OT capacity meet. Our results generalize and improve upon the results on wiretapped OT capacity by Mishra et al. Finally, we propose a protocol for a larger class of wiretapped channels and derive a lower bound on the wiretapped OT capacity.

      IoT data markets in public and private institutions have become increasingly relevant in recent years because of their potential to improve data availability and unlock new business models. However, exchanging data in markets bears considerable challenges related to disclosing sensitive information. Despite considerable research focused on different aspects of privacy-enhancing data markets for the IoT, none of the solutions proposed so far seems to find a practical adoption. Thus, this study aims to organize the state-of-the-art solutions, analyze and scope the technologies that have been suggested in this context, and structure the remaining challenges to determine areas where future research is required. To accomplish this goal, we conducted a systematic literature review on privacy enhancement in data markets for the IoT, covering 50 publications dated up to July 2020, and provided updates with 24 publications dated up to May 2022. Our results indicate that most research in this area has emerged only recently, and no IoT data market architecture has established itself as canonical. Existing solutions frequently lack the required combination of anonymization and secure computation technologies. Furthermore, there is no consensus on the appropriate use of blockchain technology for IoT data markets and a low degree of leveraging existing libraries or reusing generic data market architectures. We also identified significant challenges remaining, such as the copy problem and the recursive enforcement problem that-while solutions have been suggested to some extent-are often not sufficiently addressed in proposed designs. We conclude that privacy-enhancing technologies need further improvements to positively impact data markets so that, ultimately, the value of data is preserved through data scarcity and users' privacy and businesses-critical information are protected.

      This work presents a systematic study of navigational tracking, the latest development in the cat-and-mouse game between browsers and online trackers. Navigational tracking allows trackers to 'aggregate users' activities and behaviors across sites by modifying their navigation requests. This technique is particularly important because it circumvents the increasing efforts by browsers to partition or block third-party storage, which was previously necessary for most cross-website tracking. While previous work has studied specific navigational tracking techniques (i.e. "bounce tracking"), our work is the first effort to systematically study and measure the entire category of navigational tracking techniques. We describe and measure the frequency of two different navigational tracking techniques on the Web, and find that navigational tracking is present on slightly more than ten percent of all navigations that we made. Our contributions include identifying 214 domains belonging to at least 104 organizations tracking users across sites through link decoration techniques using direct or indirect navigation flows. We identify a further 23 domains belonging to at least 16 organizations tracking users through bounce tracking (i.e. bouncing users through unrelated third parties to generate user profiles). We also improve on prior techniques for differenting user identifiers from non-sensitive information, which is necessary to detect one class of navigational tracking. We discuss how our findings can used to protect users from navigational tracking, and commit to releasing both our complete dataset and our measurement pipeline

      COVID-19 vaccines have already prevented millions of deaths during the current pandemic.1 Given the strong association between increasing age and severe COVID-19 outcomes, adults were prioritised for vaccination when the first COVID-19 vaccines were authorised at the end of 2020.2 For children, BNT162b2 (Pfizer&#8211;BioNTech), an mRNA-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, was authorised in May, 2021, for adolescents aged 12&#8211;15 years and in December, 2021, for those aged 5&#8211;11 years. In The Lancet, Chiara Sacco and colleagues3 report the effectiveness of BNT162b2 in children aged 5&#8211;11 years after the omicron variant (B.1.1.529) emerged in Italy.

      Devolution is about how parliaments and governments make decisions. In the UK, separate legislatures and executives in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have many powers to make laws and deliver public services. One of the dominant institutions in Scotland, which is seen as both identifiably British and a source of pride to most people, is the National Health Service (NHS).1 Although governed separately within Scotland, the NHS is founded on a set of values that span the UK: the principle that everyone is entitled to care and treatment free at the point of use.

      Weakly supervised action localization is a challenging task with extensive applications, which aims to identify actions and the corresponding temporal intervals with only video-level annotations available. This paper analyzes the order-sensitive and location-insensitive properties of actions, and embodies them into a self-augmented learning framework to improve the weakly supervised action localization performance. To be specific, we propose a novel two-branch network architecture with intra/inter-action shuffling, referred to as ActShufNet. The intra-action shuffling branch lays out a self-supervised order prediction task to augment the video representation with inner-video relevance, whereas the inter-action shuffling branch imposes a reorganizing strategy on the existing action contents to augment the training set without resorting to any external resources. Furthermore, the global-local adversarial training is presented to enhance the model&#8217;s robustness to irrelevant noises. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets, and the results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

      Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a popular technique for sequence alignment, and is the de facto standard for dynamic signature verification. In this paper, we go a significant step further to enhance DTW with the capability of deep representation learning, and propose an end-to-end trainable Deep soft-DTW (DsDTW) model for dynamic signature verification. Specifically, we design a convolutional recurrent adaptive network (CRAN) to process dynamic signatures, and utilize it to provide robust and discriminative local representations as inputs for DTW. As DTW is not fully differentiable with regard to its inputs, we introduce its smoothed formulation, soft-DTW, and incorporate the soft-DTW distances of signature pairs into the loss function for optimization. Because soft-DTW is differentiable, the proposed DsDTW is end-to-end trainable, and achieves an elegant integration of CRAN deep learning model and traditional DTW mechanism. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several public benchmarks, and has won first place in the ICDAR 2021 competition for online signature verification. Source codes of DsDTW is available at https://github.com/KAKAFEI123/DsDTW.

      Rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) will be increasingly utilized by residential customers due to their economic and environmental benefits. However, the intermittent power produced by PVs and the additional loads required for the PEV charging can cause power quality disturbances in the low-voltage distribution networks (LVDN). An adaptable correlated control (ACC) is proposed for the decoupled optimization of the active and reactive power, where energy cost can be minimized through the local demand-side management (DSM) of residential loads. Further, the optimal allocation of the sparse capacity of inverters for reactive power compensation to maintain the voltage variations and the mitigation of voltage unbalances within the allowable limits is proposed. The proposed ACC provides a supervisory control to observe and modify the voltage quality of the LVDN without the need for real-time collaboration between controllers. The impacts of the integration of installed rooftop PVs and PEV charging for unbalanced three-phase LVDNs are assessed rigorously using a versatile simulation platform. Also, the suitability of the proposed control strategy for DSM and the alleviation of voltage fluctuations and unbalances are assessed.

      In industrial processes, data-driven soft sensors have played an important role for the effective process control, optimization, and monitoring. Deep learning technique has been widely used in soft sensor field in recent years for its excellent feature representation capability in spatial and temporal scales. However, the shortcomings for deep learning technique seriously hinder its application in industrial processes. For example, the knowledge cannot be added into the model, and the model prediction could not be well explained. To solve those problems, the graph mining, convolution, and explanation framework is proposed for knowledge automation in this article. Based on the equivalence analysis of the self-attention mechanism (SAM) and graph convolution (GC) operation, the spatial SAM is adopted for knowledge discovery from data directly. After that, the GC layer considering the relationship between process variables can utilize the knowledge for constructing soft sensor models. Besides, to explain which knowledge contributes to the final model prediction, the graph neural network explainer is designed for explaining the model output. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the framework are evaluated on an industrial process, in which the knowledge discovered from the data is of great consistence with the prior knowledge, and the final explanation indicated that most of the knowledge is consistent with the prior knowledge contributed to the prediction.

      N OWADAYS, billions of devices are connected to the In-ternet, enabling Internet of Things (IoT) systems widely deployed, such as smart city, smart healthcare and intelligent plant, to capture a great quantity of sensing data. Consequently, the data transmission, processing and analysis in IoT applications bring a great pressure to the central server. Fortunately, distributed intelligence becomes one of the potential solutions. Distributed intelligence can greatly relieve server pressures via plenty of terminal devices, and these devices collaboratively perceive and handle the mass data to improve the reliability, s-calability and security of industrial IoT systems. As future IoT system will embrace more wireless sensors and devices, the high-performance computing, high-bandwidth and low-latency communication are excessively required, many new research opportunities and challenges for distributed intelligence over Internet of things have arisen. To promote the development of distributed intelligence technology, this special section (SS) focuses on various technologies and platforms regarding industrial IoT systems. This special section received nearly 50 submitted manuscripts, out of which 10 of them have been accepted after a rigorous peer review. Each manuscript is reviewed by multiple rounds of review with at least three or four reviewers, the problems to be solved and the innovation of each manuscript are mainly concerned. Then the accepted papers are summarized as follows in details. Considering the joint optimization of the offloading decision and resource allocation under limited resource constraints in collaborative edge computing networks with multiple IIoT devices and MEC servers, an improved differential evolution algorithm [7] is proposed to minimize the weighted sum of cost of energy consumption and time delay, which can effectively reduce the system delay and energy consumption. In order to improve the performance of task scheduling in cloud computing- Attiya et al. [1] propose a novel hybrid swarm intelligence method MRFOSSA, which uses a modified Manta-Ray Foraging Optimizer (MRFO) and the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA). MRFOSSA is superior to other methods in terms of makespan time and cloud throughput. The research goal of the paper [5] is to design an intelligent computing offloading strategy for industrial applications in order to optimize costs and mitigate energy losses. Then the paper proposes to combine a fog controller and AI-based learning techniques so that the fog controller can intelligently assign tasks to the most appropriate fog devices and find the appropriate path to the target. Considering the resource utilization efficiency under dynamic overload requests and network states in IIoT, Chen et al. [2] propose DRL-based intelligent SFC orchestration scheme and jointly optimize the VNF deployment and SFC embedment by the improved DDQN algorithm, which can improve the performance of resource utilization rate, execution cost and delay compared with other representative schemes. To solve the problem of resource allocation and energy cost in Internet of Vehicles, Kong et al. [8] design a joint computing and caching framework and formulate the problem as a reinforcement learning problem to minimize the energy cost. On this basis, the optimization algorithm based on DDPG is proposed, which can effectively decrease energy costs. To reduce the query numbers of the object model when constructing adversarial examples, Zhang et al. [10] propose generating adversarial examples with shadow model (GASM), i.e., transfering the query operations to the designed shadow model, which can achieve high attack success rates. Chen et al. [3] revise a Decentralized-Wireless-Federated-Learning algorithm (DWFL) which utilizes the superposition property of the analog scheme. It can solve the problem of single failure, limited bandwidth resource and privacy protection in wireless federated learning algorithm, which can be appli

      The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a fast-growing network of Internet-connected sensing and actuating devices aimed to enhance manufacturing and industrial operations. This interconnection generates a high volume of data over the IIoT network and raises serious security (e.g., the rapid evolution of hacking techniques), privacy (e.g., adversaries performing data poisoning and inference attacks), and scalability issues. To mitigate the aforementioned challenges, this article presents, a new privacy-preserved threat intelligence framework (P2TIF) to protect confidential information and to identify cyber-threats in IIoT environments. There are two major elements in the proposed P2TIF framework. First, a scalable blockchain module that enables secure communication of IIoT data and prevents data poisoning attacks. Second, a deep learning module that transforms actual data into a new format and protects data from inference attacks using a deep variational autoencoder (DVAE) technique. The encoded data are then employed by a threat detection system using attention-based deep gated recurrent neural network (A-DGRNN) to recognize malicious patterns in IIoT environments. The proposed framework is validated using two different network data sources, i.e., ToN-IoT and IoT-Botnet. Security analysis and experimental results revealed the high efficiency and scalability of the proposed P2TIF framework.

      Security in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is vital as there are some cases where IIoT devices collect sensory information for crucial social production and life. Thus, designing secure and efficient communication channels is always a research hotspot. However, end devices have memory, computation, and power-supplying capacities limitations. Moreover, perfect forward secrecy (PFS), which means that long-term key exposure still discloses previous session keys, is a critical security property for authentication and key exchange (AKE). This article proposes an AKE protocol named SAKE* for the IIoT environment, where two types of keys (i.e., a master key and an evolution key) guarantee PFS. In addition, the SAKE* protocol merely uses concatenation, XOR, and hash-function operations to achieve lightweight authentication, key exchange, and message integrity. We also compare the SAKE* protocol with seven current and IoT-related authentication protocols regarding security properties and performance. Comparison results indicate that the SAKE* protocol consumes the least computation resource and third-least communication cost among eight AKE protocols while equipping 12 security properties.

      With the loss of a large number of space vectors under switch open-circuit faults, the neutral point potential (NPP) control of T-type three-level converters is faced with a huge challenge. It becomes harsh to balance the NPP and maintain the symmetry of line voltages under switch open-circuit faults simultaneously. In order to improve the NPP control performance and stable operation of T-type three-level converters, this article presents a hybrid modulation strategy that can enhance the NPP control ability even under switch open-circuit faults. Through a carrier-based analysis tool, two candidate modulation strategies are first evaluated from the perspective of the adjustment range of the neutral point current. The first one maintains the conventional three-level modulation in two nonfault phase arms. The second one degrades the mode of modulation from three-level modulation to two-level modulation in two nonfault phase arms. By making full use of the NPP oscillation characteristics of the two candidate methods, a hybrid modulation strategy based on transition duty-cycle and enabled bridge-arm adjustment is put forward to achieve a comprehensive optimal control performance. Numerical analysis and experiments are carried on to prove the correctness and feasibility of the proposed method.

</p>

<p>
      An improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on Gaussian distribution model is proposed to realize the autotuning of weighting factors for the cost function design in the model predictive control method. First, the design principle of the weighting factors in model predictive torque control for permanent magnet synchronous motor system is analyzed. Then, using the root mean square of the current error in the two-phase rotating coordinate system and the system switching frequency as references, the objective function of the particles in the PSO is designed by considering the main control goals of reducing the torque ripple, the current total harmonic distortion, and the switching frequency. The Gaussian individual optimal distribution model is used to update the particle position on the structure of the conventional PSO algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method can solve the problem of weighting factors design as it reduces the switching frequency of the system while achieving excellent steady-state performance.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      In this article, a fully soft switched interleaved bidirectional buck/boost converter with high voltage conversion ratio (VCR) and no pulsating current at low voltage source is proposed. Winding cross-coupled inductors technique is employed in order to increase VCR and mitigate current ripple at low voltage side. Moreover, soft switching conditions for all semiconductor devices are provided and the leakage inductances energy of coupled inductors are absorbed in both high step-up/down operating modes. Furthermore, the reverse recovery problem of all diodes is removed due to zero current switching turn off. All the mentioned advantages are achieved for a bidirectional converter with two interleaved phases in both high step-up/down operating modes by only one clamp circuit consisting of a clamp capacitor and two active switches. Also, the body diodes of the main switches are utilized as the main diodes to reduce the element count. The converter performance is validated by theoretical analysis and an 800 W prototype circuit in both operating modes.

      Due to a short-time gap breakdown in electrical discharge machining (EDM), a high dynamic response and flexible discharge current control ability are required for a pulse power generator. Therefore, a one-cycle control(OCC) of output current for a buck-type EDM pulse power generator is proposed. Considering the inductor current operating state, a full-range OCC current control is presented, and the Taylor expansion method is used for the duty cycle calculation. A duty cycle optimization strategy is proposed for transient states. Based on the small signal modeling, the dynamic response ability of the system is analyzed. The discharge current can switch from many transient states to a steady state in a few switching cycles without a current overshoot, and follow the average current reference well in the steady state.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      The wide bandwidth impedance of grid and inverter are the critical parameters for small-signal stability analysis and control optimization of grid-tied inverter systems. The impedance measurement is an effective way to obtain the grid and inverter impedance by injecting a series of perturbations into the measured system. However, previous studies fail to fully consider the adverse grid voltage conditions; including harmonics, unbalance, frequency deviation, voltage sag, and phase jump; which may bring errors to the measured impedance. In this article, a cascaded delayed signal cancellation (CDSC)-based method is proposed to accurately obtain the impedance of the measured system under adverse grid voltage conditions. The proposed CDSC-based method is mainly composed of the perturbation extraction module (PEM) and frequency adaptive module (FAM). Different CDSC blocks are applied to implement the PEM and FAM to extract the injected perturbations adaptively, under various adverse grid voltage conditions. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiment results are presented to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed impedance measurement method.

        Governments rely on citizen compliance for official rules to be effective. Yet achieving compliance is often tricky, particular when individual costs are high. Under what conditions will citizens voluntarily respect collective rules? We explore public compliance with SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus) restrictions, focusing on the role of political trust. We anticipate that the effects of trust on compliance will be conditional on the presence of other factors, notably fear of infection. Low levels of fear may provide room for trust to shape compliance; yet high levels of fear may &#8216;crowd out&#8217; the role of trust. We hypothesize that, at the pandemic&#8217;s outset, compliance was likely to be shaped more by fear than by trust. Yet as the pandemic progressed, the impact of fear on compliance was likely to have weakened, and the impact of trust to have strengthened. These hypotheses are tested using longitudinal data from Austria, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

        Little is known about whether and under which conditions populist radical right parties&#8217; (PRRPs&#8217;) nativist welfare politics matters to the voters. I address this gap in the research and test the argument that the electoral appeal of this electoral discourse varies among welfare regimes. The study compares the conservative and social-democratic welfare regimes and focuses on the vote choices of the two core constituencies of PRRPs &#8211; economically exposed and immigration-sceptic voters. The results show that these electorates support PRRPs&#8217; nativist welfare positions for very different reasons in the two welfare regimes. First, in the conservative regime, economically exposed citizens vote for PRRPs, the more they stress nativism and welfare expansion. By contrast, in the social-democratic regime this group of voters is more likely to support positions combining nativism and dismantled welfare benefits. Second, immigrant-sceptic voters in the social-democratic regime support PRRPs who pledge to preserve the welfare state, and increased migration considerably boosts the probability that they do so. By contrast, this group of voters in the conservative regime is more likely to support PRRPs who seek to partly dismantle the welfare state, and the inflow of immigrants is unrelated to these choices. These results have important implications and suggest that welfare regimes moderate public opinion differently in the current age of populism compared to previous eras.

      <p>
        In 2014, the USA initiated the formation of a multilateral military operation against Daesh in Syria and Iraq. Eventually, more than 70 states joined the anti-Daesh coalition. However, contributions to the military effort have been characterized by great variance, especially among EU member states. While some states took leading roles in the airstrikes, others provided training for Iraqi and Kurdish forces, and still others did not get involved beyond voicing their support for the policy. Against this backdrop, this article makes a two-fold contribution to the literature on military coalitions and security policy. Empirically, the article provides a mapping of the then 28 EU member states&#8217; military engagement in the fight against Daesh in Syria and Iraq. Analytically, fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) is applied to account for the observed pattern of military involvement, using an integrative framework that combines international and domestic factors. The results demonstrate that multiple paths led towards EU military involvement in the anti-Daesh coalition. At the same time, international-level incentives, such as external threat and/or alliance value feature prominently in all three identified paths. The analysis further underscores the value of a configurational perspective, because neither an external threat nor alliance value are sufficient on their own to bring about the outcome. Across the set-theoretic configurations, these conditions either combine with other &#8216;push&#8217; factors or with the absence of constraints against military involvement. In line with the latter, the article highlights the policy relevance of institutional constraints, especially legislative veto rights, since most of those countries that were involved in the airstrikes of the anti-Daesh coalition did not have formal parliamentary involvement on matters of military deployment policy.

      <p>
        How do coalitional dynamics matter for the capacity of states to maintain social inclusion in coordinated models of capitalism? Taking its departure in scholarship emphasizing the influence of employers on the extent of state intervention in post-industrial economies, this paper argues that employer influence depends on which actors they team up with &#8211; unions or parties. If unions depend on employers for their organizational influence in a policy field, unions become a strong coalitional partner for employers in weakening demands for inclusiveness from the parliamentary arena. Conversely, if unions have influence independent of any coalition with employers, both unions and employers are likely to team up with political parties aligned with their preferences. This makes the level of inclusion resulting from increased state intervention more fluctuating, depending on who holds government power. A comparative study of reforms of Danish and Austrian vocational education institutions corroborates the empirical purchase of the argument.

      <p>
        While there has been a veritable boom in literature on organized interests, their lobbying strategies, relationships with decision-makers, and their impact on policymaking, only a few studies have explored internal organizational developments and, specifically, the professionalization of interest groups. The present study focuses on the national and transnational factors driving the professionalization of interest groups in Central and Eastern Europe, a region previously neglected in much of the interest group literature. Based on a sample of more than 400 surveyed organizations operating in Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovenia in the healthcare, higher education, and energy sectors, we explore three bundles of factors potentially enhancing the professionalization of interest groups &#8211; organizational funding sources, national and transnational intergroup cooperation and organizations&#8217; standing in the domestic interest group system. Our statistical analyses show that state subsidies and tight policy coordination with the state are crucial drivers of internal organizational professionalization, suggesting rather patronistic and symbiotic relationships between the state and certain organizations. However, our data also support the notion that interorganizational collaboration, both at the national and international levels, may also be key to organizational professionalization, enabling groups that lack close ties with the state to compensate their disadvantage with intensive domestic and international networking. The study is also among the first to link increasing professionalization with organizational population density.

      Zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR) has attracted great attention recently, due to the potential application of sketch-based retrieval under zero-shot scenarios, where the categories of query sketches and gallery photos are not observed in the training stage. However, it is still under insufficient exploration for the general and practical scenario when the query sketches and gallery photos contain both seen and unseen categories. Such a problem is defined as generalized zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (GZS-SBIR), which is the focus of this work. To this end, we propose a novel Augmented Multi-modality Fusion (AMF) framework to generalize seen concepts to unobserved ones efficiently. Specifically, a novel knowledge discovery module named cross-domain augmentation is designed in both visual and semantic space to mimic novel knowledge unseen from the training stage, which is the key to handling the GZS-SBIR challenge. Moreover, a triplet domain alignment module is proposed to couple the cross-domain distribution between photo and sketch in visual space. To enhance the robustness of our model, we explore embedding propagation to refine both visual and semantic features by removing undesired noise. Eventually, visual-semantic fusion representations are concatenated for further domain discrimination and task-specific recognition, which tend to trigger the cross-domain alignment in both visual and semantic feature space. Experimental evaluations are conducted on popular ZS-SBIR benchmarks as well as a new evaluation protocol designed for GZS-SBIR from DomainNet dataset with more diverse sub-domains, and the promising results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution over other baselines.

<p>
      Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) is an emerging secure distributed learning paradigm that aggregates user-trained local gradients into a federated model through a cryptographic protocol. Unfortunately, PPFL is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks launched by a Byzantine adversary, who crafts malicious local gradients to harm the accuracy of the federated model. To resist model poisoning attacks, existing defense strategies focus on identifying suspicious local gradients over plaintexts. However, the Byzantine adversary submits encrypted poisonous gradients to circumvent existing defense strategies in PPFL, resulting in encrypted model poisoning. To address the issue, in this paper we design a privacy-preserving defense strategy using two-trapdoor homomorphic encryption (referred to as ShieldFL), which can resist encrypted model poisoning without compromising privacy in PPFL. Specially, we first present the secure cosine similarity method aiming to measure the distance between two encrypted gradients. Then, we propose the Byzantine-tolerance aggregation using cosine similarity, which can achieve robustness for both Independently Identically Distribution (IID) and non-IID data. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets (i.e., MNIST, KDDCup99, and Amazon) show that ShieldFL outperforms existing defense strategies. Especially, ShieldFL can achieve 30%-80% accuracy improvement to defend two state-of-the-art model poisoning attacks in both non-IID and IID settings.

      When public clouds become the platform of choice for MapReduce processing, users are placing higher demands on the privacy of the job data and program. A number of solutions employed trusted hardware to protect MapReduce tasks. However, existing works pointed out that simply protecting individual nodes in the MapReduce cluster with trusted hardware and protecting cross-node communication with encryption still leak information from side-channels. Specifically, attackers can derive data information by observing and manipulating cross-node communication traffic volumes. Although existing works proposed some solutions to prevent such leakage, in this paper, we show that previous solutions still leak critical job information. Additionally, our study shows that previous solutions have limitations from other aspects, including data restriction, partition function restriction, reliability issue, and high overheads. To address all the discovered limitations, we introduced the Strong Shuffle solution. Our analysis and experimental results showed that our solution has reduced the information leakage and addressed other discovered limitations. To support Strong Shuffle, we proposed a variant Bloom Filter, named Group-based Dynamic Bloom Filter (GDBF). Our theoretical analysis showed that GDBF has lower performance and storage overhead than the traditional Scalable Bloom Filter.

      We propose a universal background subtraction framework based on the Arithmetic Distribution Neural Network (ADNN) for learning the distributions of temporal pixels. In our ADNN model, the arithmetic distribution operations are utilized to introduce the arithmetic distribution layers, including the product distribution layer and the sum distribution layer. Furthermore, in order to improve the accuracy of the proposed approach, an improved Bayesian refinement model based on neighboring information, with a GPU implementation, is incorporated. In the forward pass and backpropagation of the proposed arithmetic distribution layers, histograms are considered as probability density functions rather than matrices. Thus, the proposed approach is able to utilize the probability information of the histogram and achieve promising results with a very simple architecture compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. Evaluations using standard benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art traditional and deep learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to propose network layers based on arithmetic distribution operations for learning distributions during background subtraction.

</p>

      Cloud storage is more and more prevalent in practice, and thus how to check its integrity becomes increasingly essential. A classical solution is identity-based (ID-based) provable data possession (PDP), which supports certificateless cloud storage auditing without entire user data. However, existing ID-PDP protocols always require that cloud users outsource data blocks, authenticators and a small-sized file tag to the cloud, and make use of the heavy elliptic curve cryptography over bilinear pairing. These disadvantages would result in vast storage, communication, and computation costs, which is unexpected, especially for resource-limited cloud users. To improve the performance, this paper proposes a novel cryptographic primitive: ID-based PDP with compressed cloud storage. In this model, cloud storage auditing can be achieved by using only encrypted data blocks in a self-verified way, and original data blocks can be reconstructed from the outsourced data. Thus, data owners no longer need to store original data blocks on the cloud. We also use some basic algebraic operations to realize a concrete ID-based PDP protocol with compressed cloud storage, which is quite efficient due to no heavy cryptographic operations involved. The proposed protocol can easily be extended to support the other practical functions by using the primitive replacement technique. The proposed protocol is strictly proven to have the properties of correctness, privacy, unforgeability and detectability. Finally, we give plenty of theoretical analysis and experimental results to validate the efficiency of the proposed protocol.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      It has been widely observed that deep neural networks are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. Decision-based attacks could generate adversarial examples based solely on top-1 labels returned by the target model. However, they typically make excessive queries and could not bypass detection effectively. To comprehensively assess a decision-based attack, besides its query efficiency, the performance against detection is also a concern. Considering that previous detections consume massive resources and always mistakenly recognize benign video frames as malicious attacks, we design a lightweight detection called boundary detection to overcome the above limitations, whose success reveals serious limitations of existing decision-based attacks. To develop more powerful attacks, we first present f-mixup as a basic method to produce candidate adversarial examples in the frequency domain. Using f-mixup as the building block, we propose f-attack as a complete decision-based attack. With the help of several natural images, f-attack could both work well with limited (hundreds of) queries and bypass detection effectively. Nevertheless, if the attacker could make relatively adequate (thousands of) queries and the target model is not equipped with detection, f-attack will lag behind existing decision-based attacks. We additionally introduce frequency binary search based on f-mixup, which serves as a plug-and-play module for existing decision-based attacks to further improve their query efficiency. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      Semi-supervised few-shot learning aims to improve the model generalization ability by means of both limited labeled data and widely-available unlabeled data. Previous works attempt to model the relations between the few-shot labeled data and extra unlabeled data, by performing a label propagation or pseudo-labeling process using an episodic training strategy. However, the feature distribution represented by the pseudo-labeled data itself is coarse-grained, meaning that there might be a large distribution gap between the pseudo-labeled data and the real query data. To this end, we propose a sample-centric feature generation (SFG) approach for semi-supervised few-shot image classification. Specifically, the few-shot labeled samples from different classes are initially trained to predict pseudo-labels for the potential unlabeled samples. Next, a semi-supervised meta-generator is utilized to produce derivative features centering around each pseudo-labeled sample, enriching the intra-class feature diversity. Meanwhile, the sample-centric generation constrains the generated features to be compact and close to the pseudo-labeled sample, ensuring the inter-class feature discriminability. Further, a reliability assessment (RA) metric is developed to weaken the influence of generated outliers on model learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed feature generation approach on challenging one- and few-shot image classification benchmarks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      In this paper, we make the first benchmark effort to elaborate on the superiority of using RAW images in the low light enhancement and develop a novel alternative route to utilize RAW images in a more flexible and practical way. Inspired by a full consideration on the typical image processing pipeline, we are inspired to develop a new evaluation framework, Factorized Enhancement Model (FEM), which decomposes the properties of RAW images into measurable factors and provides a tool for exploring how properties of RAW images affect the enhancement performance empirically. The empirical benchmark results show that the Linearity of data and Exposure Time recorded in meta-data play the most critical role, which brings distinct performance gains in various measures over the approaches taking the sRGB images as input. With the insights obtained from the benchmark results in mind, a RAW-guiding Exposure Enhancement Network (REENet) is developed, which makes trade-offs between the advantages and inaccessibility of RAW images in real applications in a way of using RAW images only in the training phase. REENet projects sRGB images into linear RAW domains to apply constraints with corresponding RAW images to reduce the difficulty of modeling training. After that, in the testing phase, our REENet does not rely on RAW images. Experimental results demonstrate not only the superiority of REENet to state-of-the-art sRGB-based methods and but also the effectiveness of the RAW guidance and all components.

      Repeatable, convergent outcomes are prima facie evidence for determinism in evolutionary processes. Among fishes, well-known examples include microevolutionary habitat transitions into the water column, where freshwater populations (e.g., sticklebacks, cichlids, and whitefishes) recurrently diverge toward slender-bodied pelagic forms and deep-bodied benthic forms. However, the consequences of such processes at deeper...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Pnas-RssFeedOfEarlyEditionArticles/~4/FgxKzBIPOmc" width="1">
