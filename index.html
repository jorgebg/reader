      This article addresses the problem of formulating efficient and reliable operational preservation policies that ensure bit-level information integrity over long periods, and in the presence of a diverse range of real-world technical, legal, organizational, and economic threats. We develop a systematic, quantitative prediction framework that combines formal modeling, discrete-event-based simulation, hierarchical modeling, and then use empirically calibrated sensitivity analysis to identify effective strategies. The framework offers flexibility for the modeling of a wide range of preservation policies and threats. Since this framework is open source and easily deployed in a cloud computing environment, it can be used to produce analysis based on independent estimates of scenario-specific costs, reliability, and risks.

      Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is an identity model centered on the user. The user maintains and controls their data in this model. When a service provider requests data from the user, the user sends it directly to the service provider, bypassing third-party intermediaries. Thus, SSI reduces identity providers' involvement in the identification, authentication, and authorization, thereby increasing user privacy. Additionally, users can share portions of their personal information with service providers, significantly improving user privacy. This identity model has drawn the attention of researchers and organizations worldwide, resulting in an increase in both scientific and non-scientific literature on the subject. This study conducts a comprehensive and rigorous systematic review of the literature and a systematic mapping of theoretical and practical advances in SSI. We identified and analyzed evidence from reviewed materials to address four research questions, resulting in a novel SSI taxonomy used to categorize and review publications. Additionally, open challenges are discussed, along with recommendations for future work.

      Federated recommendation addresses the data silo and privacy problems altogether for recommender systems. Current federated recommender systems mainly utilize cryptographic or obfuscation methods to protect the original ratings from leakage. However, the former comes with extra communication and computation costs, and the latter damages model accuracy. Neither of them could simultaneously satisfy the real-time feedback and accurate personalization requirements of recommender systems. In this paper, we proposed federated masked matrix factorization (FedMMF) to protect the data privacy in federated recommender systems without sacrificing efficiency and effectiveness. In more details, we introduce the new idea of personalized mask generated only from local data and apply it in FedMMF. On the one hand, personalized mask offers protection for participants' private data without effectiveness loss. On the other hand, combined with the adaptive secure aggregation protocol, personalized mask could further improve efficiency. Theoretically, we provide security analysis for personalized mask. Empirically, we also show the superiority of the designed model on different real-world data sets.

      Federated learning (FL) has rapidly risen in popularity due to its promise of privacy and efficiency. Previous works have exposed privacy vulnerabilities in the FL pipeline by recovering user data from gradient updates. However, existing attacks fail to address realistic settings because they either 1) require toy settings with very small batch sizes, or 2) require unrealistic and conspicuous architecture modifications. We introduce a new strategy that dramatically elevates existing attacks to operate on batches of arbitrarily large size, and without architectural modifications. Our model-agnostic strategy only requires modifications to the model parameters sent to the user, which is a realistic threat model in many scenarios. We demonstrate the strategy in challenging large-scale settings, obtaining high-fidelity data extraction in both cross-device and cross-silo federated learning.

      We received positive feedback and inquiries on the previous version of HTTPA [11](HTTPA/1). As a result, we present a major revision of the HTTPA protocol (HTTPA/2) to protect sensitive data in HTTPA transactions from cyber attacks. Comparatively, the previous work [11] is mainly focused on how to include remote attestation (RA) and secret provisioning to the HTTP protocol with Transport Layer Security (TLS) protection across the Internet, which is great, but it comes at a price. In contrast, HTTPA/2 is not necessary to rely on the TLS protocol, such as TLS 1.3 [20], for secure communication over the Internet. The design of HTTPA/2 follows the SIGMA model [13] to establish a trusted (attested) and secure communication context between endpoints at layer 7 (L7) of the OSI model. Different from connection-based protocols, HTTPA/2 is transaction-based in which the TEE is considered to be a new type of requested resource over the Internet. In addition to protecting sensitive data transmitted to TEE-based services (TServices), HTTPA/2 can potentially be used to optimize the end-to-end performance of Internet or cloud backend traffic, thus saving energy and reducing the operational costs of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). We envision that HTTPA/2 will further enable confidential web services and trustworthy AI applications in the future.

<p>
      To the Editor A recent article suggested that the use of non&#8211;vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) within 7 days of intravenous alteplase was not associated with an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. However, we are concerned that some readers may interpret these results as an endorsement of the use of alteplase in patients with acute stroke who were taking NOACs, irrespective of the time frame of last use. Based on dose-finding studies, the drug half-life is 12 hours for apixaban, 11 to 13 hours for rivaroxaban, 10 to 14 hours for edoxaban, and 12 to 17 hours for dabigatran in patients with normal kidney function, meaning that within 48 hours (4 to 5 half-lives), there would be limited residual anticoagulant effect.

      In Reply Dr Wirta&#8217;s Letter discusses varenicline nasal spray as a potential treatment option for dry eye disease. This drug, which was approved after submission of our clinical update, is an exciting addition to the current armamentarium of therapies for dry eye disease. The goal of our article was to provide an overview of the pathophysiology of dry eye disease, an approach to evaluating patients, and a review of current treatment strategies for clinicians practicing outside the field of ophthalmology. Therefore, we felt that discussion of pipeline treatments and those under investigation was beyond the scope of our article. Additionally, we agree that effective management of dry eye disease requires recognition of the multifactorial and complex nature of this condition and that treatment strategies must be tailored for each individual patient.

      In Reply In response to the comments by Drs Lin and Chen, we would first like to underscore that the Prague OHCA Study did not enroll any patients with ROSC. Patients with early ROSC (n&#8201;=&#8201;1263) were not considered for study inclusion, as outlined in Figure 1 of our article. Our study randomized patients after at least of 5 minutes of initial advanced cardiac life support. However, the median time from collapse to randomization was 25 minutes, and the median duration of resuscitation was 52.5 minutes. The initial period of 25 minutes before randomization included approximately 8 to 10 minutes for the emergency medical service crews to reach the scene and 15 to 17 minutes of initial resuscitation.

<p>
      Rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) will be increasingly utilized by residential customers due to their economic and environmental benefits. However, the intermittent power produced by PVs and the additional loads required for the PEV charging can cause power quality disturbances in the low-voltage distribution networks (LVDN). An adaptable correlated control (ACC) is proposed for the decoupled optimization of the active and reactive power, where energy cost can be minimized through the local demand-side management (DSM) of residential loads. Further, the optimal allocation of the sparse capacity of inverters for reactive power compensation to maintain the voltage variations and the mitigation of voltage unbalances within the allowable limits is proposed. The proposed ACC provides a supervisory control to observe and modify the voltage quality of the LVDN without the need for real-time collaboration between controllers. The impacts of the integration of installed rooftop PVs and PEV charging for unbalanced three-phase LVDNs are assessed rigorously using a versatile simulation platform. Also, the suitability of the proposed control strategy for DSM and the alleviation of voltage fluctuations and unbalances are assessed.

      Energy Internet (EI) is developing and booming rapidly with the increase of distributed energy resources, which is beneficial to address the severe condition of industrial energy. However, there are inevitable credit crises and utility optimization challenges in EI that need to be settled. In this article, we propose a blockchain-assisted software defined energy Internet (BSDEI), where a distributed energy market smart contract is designed to ensure transactions executed reliably and participants&#8217; accounts dealt accurately. In order to jointly optimize the utilities of operators, retailers, and industrial prosumers in BSDEI, we formulate the whole trading process as a three-stage Stackelberg game, with the proof of existence and uniqueness for the Stackelberg equilibrium. Then, we design a hierarchical distributed policy gradient algorithm to solve the Stackelberg game under incomplete information. We implement a blockchain-based industrial energy trading system using a middleware platform. The smart contract is deployed on the consortium blockchain, providing website interfaces for participants to operate. Furthermore, we conduct experiments for analyzing economic benefits. Our system prototype demonstrates the feasibility of BSDEI and the algorithm exceeds about 18% in total mean reward than comparing algorithms.

      N OWADAYS, billions of devices are connected to the In-ternet, enabling Internet of Things (IoT) systems widely deployed, such as smart city, smart healthcare and intelligent plant, to capture a great quantity of sensing data. Consequently, the data transmission, processing and analysis in IoT applications bring a great pressure to the central server. Fortunately, distributed intelligence becomes one of the potential solutions. Distributed intelligence can greatly relieve server pressures via plenty of terminal devices, and these devices collaboratively perceive and handle the mass data to improve the reliability, s-calability and security of industrial IoT systems. As future IoT system will embrace more wireless sensors and devices, the high-performance computing, high-bandwidth and low-latency communication are excessively required, many new research opportunities and challenges for distributed intelligence over Internet of things have arisen. To promote the development of distributed intelligence technology, this special section (SS) focuses on various technologies and platforms regarding industrial IoT systems. This special section received nearly 50 submitted manuscripts, out of which 10 of them have been accepted after a rigorous peer review. Each manuscript is reviewed by multiple rounds of review with at least three or four reviewers, the problems to be solved and the innovation of each manuscript are mainly concerned. Then the accepted papers are summarized as follows in details. Considering the joint optimization of the offloading decision and resource allocation under limited resource constraints in collaborative edge computing networks with multiple IIoT devices and MEC servers, an improved differential evolution algorithm [7] is proposed to minimize the weighted sum of cost of energy consumption and time delay, which can effectively reduce the system delay and energy consumption. In order to improve the performance of task scheduling in cloud computing- Attiya et al. [1] propose a novel hybrid swarm intelligence method MRFOSSA, which uses a modified Manta-Ray Foraging Optimizer (MRFO) and the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA). MRFOSSA is superior to other methods in terms of makespan time and cloud throughput. The research goal of the paper [5] is to design an intelligent computing offloading strategy for industrial applications in order to optimize costs and mitigate energy losses. Then the paper proposes to combine a fog controller and AI-based learning techniques so that the fog controller can intelligently assign tasks to the most appropriate fog devices and find the appropriate path to the target. Considering the resource utilization efficiency under dynamic overload requests and network states in IIoT, Chen et al. [2] propose DRL-based intelligent SFC orchestration scheme and jointly optimize the VNF deployment and SFC embedment by the improved DDQN algorithm, which can improve the performance of resource utilization rate, execution cost and delay compared with other representative schemes. To solve the problem of resource allocation and energy cost in Internet of Vehicles, Kong et al. [8] design a joint computing and caching framework and formulate the problem as a reinforcement learning problem to minimize the energy cost. On this basis, the optimization algorithm based on DDPG is proposed, which can effectively decrease energy costs. To reduce the query numbers of the object model when constructing adversarial examples, Zhang et al. [10] propose generating adversarial examples with shadow model (GASM), i.e., transfering the query operations to the designed shadow model, which can achieve high attack success rates. Chen et al. [3] revise a Decentralized-Wireless-Federated-Learning algorithm (DWFL) which utilizes the superposition property of the analog scheme. It can solve the problem of single failure, limited bandwidth resource and privacy protection in wireless federated learning algorithm, which can be appli

      Saliency prediction models aim to mimic the human visual system&#8217;s attention process, and the research has made significant progress due to recent advancements in deep convolution neural networks. However, the high memory requirements and intensive computational demands make these approaches less suitable for Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, and there is a need for an improved computational efficiency and reduced memory footprint to facilitate distributed IoT intelligence. This article proposes a pseudoknowledge distillation (PKD) training method for creating a compact real-time saliency prediction model. The proposed method can effectively transfer knowledge from computationally expensive once-for-all (OFA-595) as a single teacher model and a combination of OFA-595 and EfficientNet-B7 as a multiteacher model to an early exit evolutionary algorithm network student model by utilizing knowledge distillation and pseudolabeling. Five saliency benchmark datasets are used to demonstrate PKD&#8217;s improved prediction performance and its reduced inference time without modifying the original student model.

      Security in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is vital as there are some cases where IIoT devices collect sensory information for crucial social production and life. Thus, designing secure and efficient communication channels is always a research hotspot. However, end devices have memory, computation, and power-supplying capacities limitations. Moreover, perfect forward secrecy (PFS), which means that long-term key exposure still discloses previous session keys, is a critical security property for authentication and key exchange (AKE). This article proposes an AKE protocol named SAKE* for the IIoT environment, where two types of keys (i.e., a master key and an evolution key) guarantee PFS. In addition, the SAKE* protocol merely uses concatenation, XOR, and hash-function operations to achieve lightweight authentication, key exchange, and message integrity. We also compare the SAKE* protocol with seven current and IoT-related authentication protocols regarding security properties and performance. Comparison results indicate that the SAKE* protocol consumes the least computation resource and third-least communication cost among eight AKE protocols while equipping 12 security properties.

      The present article proposes an effective model of synchronous reluctance machines. This model, called the Residual Magnetism (ReMa) model, takes into account not only residual magnetism within the rotor but also that within the stator. Electromotive forces generated by the ReMa model were composed of two frequencies and exhibited similar shapes as those measured in experiments. Resultant equations in a three-phase $(a,b,c)$ frame and in a Park reference frame $(d,q)$ were revealed. The comparison was made with the classical model of synchronous reluctance machine commonly used. Experimental tests were carried out to prove the effectiveness of the ReMa model which was also compared to a classical counterpart in the case where a synchronous reluctance generator was connected to a three-phase diode rectifier.

</p>

      Recently, model-based predictive current control (MB-PCC) has been presented as a good alternative to classical control algorithms in terms of simplicity and performance reliability. However, MB-PCC suffers from the high dependence on system parameters, which may deteriorate its performance under parameters variations. On the other hand, synchronous reluctance motors (SynRMs) are susceptible to suffer from inductances variations due to the magnetic saturation. Accordingly, in this article a new model-free predictive current control of SynRMs based on a recurrent neural network (RNN-PCC) is developed and proposed. The proposed RNN-PCC relies on the identification of the SynRM currents without considering any parameters. Simulation and experimental results show that both RNN-PCC and MB-PCC have similarly excellent dynamics, while better control performance and tracking errors can be achieved thanks to the proposed RNN-PCC.

</p>

      The wide bandwidth impedance of grid and inverter are the critical parameters for small-signal stability analysis and control optimization of grid-tied inverter systems. The impedance measurement is an effective way to obtain the grid and inverter impedance by injecting a series of perturbations into the measured system. However, previous studies fail to fully consider the adverse grid voltage conditions; including harmonics, unbalance, frequency deviation, voltage sag, and phase jump; which may bring errors to the measured impedance. In this article, a cascaded delayed signal cancellation (CDSC)-based method is proposed to accurately obtain the impedance of the measured system under adverse grid voltage conditions. The proposed CDSC-based method is mainly composed of the perturbation extraction module (PEM) and frequency adaptive module (FAM). Different CDSC blocks are applied to implement the PEM and FAM to extract the injected perturbations adaptively, under various adverse grid voltage conditions. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiment results are presented to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed impedance measurement method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      Pole-zero cancellation technique has drawn much attention to tackle the filter resonance of the LCL-type grid-connected inverter for simplifying the stability-oriented design. However, its potential stability risk was rarely concerned. As one representative of this technique, the weighted average current (WAC) control is assessed. It is found that the LCL resonance in the state variable WAC is cancelled out by pole-zero cancellation, but the ones in some uncontrollable or unobservable state variables such as the grid current are still inherited, resulting in harmonic instability. From this perspective, this article appeals that this technique should be cautiously used or even avoided. An extended WAC control which avoids pole-zero cancellation is proposed accordingly. The theoretical expectations are finally validated by simulation and experimental results.

<p>
      This articledemonstrates the developments toward a high-performance monolithic wheeled structure horizontal dual-axis [pitch (X-axis) and roll (Y-axis)] microelectromechanical system (MEMS) gyroscope based on off-plane coupling suppression silicon gratings. Gyroscopes have been fabricated with a silicon-on-glass fabrication process with vacuum sealed in metal packaging. The featured gyroscope operates in split mode with the bandwidths of two axes devices both of &#8764;70 Hz. By unitizing two individual active restraining control loops that adjust the quadrature amplitude via differentially biasing the silicon gratings in real time, the off-plane mechanical couplings of the two sense modes are significantly reduced by &#8764;95 and &#8764;30 times, which enables &#8764;25-fold and &#8764;56-fold improvements in the bias instability (BI) for a typical dual-axis device. Tactical-grade performances are achieved for both the X-axis and Y-axis gyroscopes with angle random walk of 0.02 deg/&#8730;h and 0.045 deg/&#8730;h along with in-run BI of 0.26 deg/h and 0.65 deg/h, respectively, without any temperature compensation. The current preliminary results show great potential to achieve navigation grade precision by employing the mode-matching technique in the future. The use of silicon gratings for out-of-plane coupling reduction also provides an effective way to build a high-performance planar monolithic chip inertial measurement unit.

      <p>
        Governments rely on citizen compliance for official rules to be effective. Yet achieving compliance is often tricky, particular when individual costs are high. Under what conditions will citizens voluntarily respect collective rules? We explore public compliance with SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus) restrictions, focusing on the role of political trust. We anticipate that the effects of trust on compliance will be conditional on the presence of other factors, notably fear of infection. Low levels of fear may provide room for trust to shape compliance; yet high levels of fear may &#8216;crowd out&#8217; the role of trust. We hypothesize that, at the pandemic&#8217;s outset, compliance was likely to be shaped more by fear than by trust. Yet as the pandemic progressed, the impact of fear on compliance was likely to have weakened, and the impact of trust to have strengthened. These hypotheses are tested using longitudinal data from Austria, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

      <p>
        Little is known about whether and under which conditions populist radical right parties&#8217; (PRRPs&#8217;) nativist welfare politics matters to the voters. I address this gap in the research and test the argument that the electoral appeal of this electoral discourse varies among welfare regimes. The study compares the conservative and social-democratic welfare regimes and focuses on the vote choices of the two core constituencies of PRRPs &#8211; economically exposed and immigration-sceptic voters. The results show that these electorates support PRRPs&#8217; nativist welfare positions for very different reasons in the two welfare regimes. First, in the conservative regime, economically exposed citizens vote for PRRPs, the more they stress nativism and welfare expansion. By contrast, in the social-democratic regime this group of voters is more likely to support positions combining nativism and dismantled welfare benefits. Second, immigrant-sceptic voters in the social-democratic regime support PRRPs who pledge to preserve the welfare state, and increased migration considerably boosts the probability that they do so. By contrast, this group of voters in the conservative regime is more likely to support PRRPs who seek to partly dismantle the welfare state, and the inflow of immigrants is unrelated to these choices. These results have important implications and suggest that welfare regimes moderate public opinion differently in the current age of populism compared to previous eras.

<div class="abstract">
      <p>
        In 2014, the USA initiated the formation of a multilateral military operation against Daesh in Syria and Iraq. Eventually, more than 70 states joined the anti-Daesh coalition. However, contributions to the military effort have been characterized by great variance, especially among EU member states. While some states took leading roles in the airstrikes, others provided training for Iraqi and Kurdish forces, and still others did not get involved beyond voicing their support for the policy. Against this backdrop, this article makes a two-fold contribution to the literature on military coalitions and security policy. Empirically, the article provides a mapping of the then 28 EU member states&#8217; military engagement in the fight against Daesh in Syria and Iraq. Analytically, fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) is applied to account for the observed pattern of military involvement, using an integrative framework that combines international and domestic factors. The results demonstrate that multiple paths led towards EU military involvement in the anti-Daesh coalition. At the same time, international-level incentives, such as external threat and/or alliance value feature prominently in all three identified paths. The analysis further underscores the value of a configurational perspective, because neither an external threat nor alliance value are sufficient on their own to bring about the outcome. Across the set-theoretic configurations, these conditions either combine with other &#8216;push&#8217; factors or with the absence of constraints against military involvement. In line with the latter, the article highlights the policy relevance of institutional constraints, especially legislative veto rights, since most of those countries that were involved in the airstrikes of the anti-Daesh coalition did not have formal parliamentary involvement on matters of military deployment policy.

<div class="itemdescription">
<div class="abstract">
      <p>
        How do coalitional dynamics matter for the capacity of states to maintain social inclusion in coordinated models of capitalism? Taking its departure in scholarship emphasizing the influence of employers on the extent of state intervention in post-industrial economies, this paper argues that employer influence depends on which actors they team up with &#8211; unions or parties. If unions depend on employers for their organizational influence in a policy field, unions become a strong coalitional partner for employers in weakening demands for inclusiveness from the parliamentary arena. Conversely, if unions have influence independent of any coalition with employers, both unions and employers are likely to team up with political parties aligned with their preferences. This makes the level of inclusion resulting from increased state intervention more fluctuating, depending on who holds government power. A comparative study of reforms of Danish and Austrian vocational education institutions corroborates the empirical purchase of the argument.

      Background clutters pose challenges to defocus blur detection. Existing approaches often produce artifact predictions in background areas with clutter and relatively low confident predictions in boundary areas. In this work, we tackle the above issues from two perspectives. Firstly, inspired by the recent success of self-attention mechanism, we introduce channel-wise and spatial-wise attention modules to attentively aggregate features at different channels and spatial locations to obtain more discriminative features. Secondly, we propose a generative adversarial training strategy to suppress spurious and low reliable predictions. This is achieved by utilizing a discriminator to identify predicted defocus map from ground-truth ones. As such, the defocus network (generator) needs to produce &#8216;realistic&#8217; defocus map to minimize discriminator loss. We further demonstrate that the generative adversarial training allows exploiting additional unlabeled data to improve performance, a.k.a. semi-supervised learning, and we provide the first benchmark on semi-supervised defocus detection. Finally, we demonstrate that the existing evaluation metrics for defocus detection generally fail to quantify the robustness with respect to thresholding. For a fair and practical evaluation, we introduce an effective yet efficient $AUF_beta $ metric. Extensive experiments on three public datasets verify the superiority of the proposed methods compared against state-of-the-art approaches.

      Existing heterogeneous face synthesis (HFS) methods focus on performing accurate image-to-image translation across domains, while they cannot effectively remove the nuisance facial variations such as poses, expressions or occlusions. To address such challenges, this paper studies a new practical heterogeneous prototype learning (HPL) problem. To be specific, given a face image contaminated by facial variations from a source domain, HPL aims to reconstruct the variation-free prototype in a specified target domain. To tackle HPL, we propose a unified and end-to-end framework named bidirectional heterogeneous prototype learning (BHPL). As a bidirectional learning framework, BHPL is able to simultaneously reconstruct the heterogeneous prototypes across source-to-target as well as target-to-source domains. Furthermore, BHPL is capable of learning the identity prototype features for the contaminated face images from both source and target domains in order to perform robust heterogeneous face recognition. BHPL consists of an encoder-decoder structural generator and two dual-task discriminators, which play an adversarial game such that the generator learns the identity prototype feature and generates the cross-domain identity-preserved prototype for each input face image from both domains, and the discriminators accurately predict face identity and distinguish real versus fake prototypes. Empirically studies on multiple heterogeneous face datasets containing facial variations demonstrate the effectiveness of BHPL.

      Cellular networks have been successfully evolved over the decades. Especially, Long-Term Evolution (LTE) has been exceedingly successful and the security threats against LTE systems have increased rapidly. Particularly, tracking LTE user devices has been shown to be effective as the temporary user identifiers (IDs) are easily extracted and used to locate targeted devices by passive eavesdroppers. We notice that naive approaches, such as frequent updates of temporary user IDs, are insufficient to mitigate user-tracking attacks since the new and old temporary IDs for the same user device are easily linkable by adversaries who can measure the wireless channel characteristics between the user device and herself. In this paper, we propose an opportunistic uplink power control scheme to minimize the probability of successful user tracking by an adversary whose location is unknown. We devise the notion of average inference error probability in order to measure the level of users&#8217; location privacy. Moreover, we derive the closed-form expression of the approximated average inference error probability and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average inference error probability under a constraint of an allowable power budget for each user. Against a passive adversary, our proposed power control scheme effectively degrades an adversary&#8217;s inference ability by 50% when 10 users are scheduled in each transmission time slot, which will lead to almost 100% inference error at the adversary over multiple time slots.

      As cities become smarter, the importance of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) will be increasingly pronounced. To support latency- and time-sensitive applications, there have been attempts to utilize fog-cloud computing in VANETs. There are, however, a number of limitations in existing fog-cloud based VANET deployments, ranging from computation and communication bottlenecks to privacy leakage to costly certificate/ pseudonym management to key escrow, and so on. Therefore, in this paper we propose a privacy-preserving aggregation authentication scheme (PPAAS). The scheme is designed for deployment in a safety warning system for fog-cloud based VANETs. Specifically, the PPAAS scheme is realized using a novel efficient anonymous certificateless aggregation signcryption scheme (CASS) proposed in this paper, and allows a fog node to aggregate signcrypted traffic-related messages from surrounding vehicles into an aggregated ciphertext and unsigncrypt them in a batch. We then evaluate the security of PPAAS and demonstrate that it supports confidentiality, authentication, and (efficient) conditional privacy, and key escrow freeness. In particular, our scheme is the first in the literature to achieve efficient conditional privacy, which avoids the need for costly pseudonym management. We also demonstrate that the scheme is practical, based on our simulation results.

      This paper presents a new method, named implicit and explicit feature purification (IEFP), for age-invariant face recognition. Facial features extracted from a face image contain the information about the identity, age, and other attributes. For age-invariant face recognition, it is important to remove the irrelevant information, and retain the identity information only, in the facial features. Through the two proposed feature purification mechanisms, our framework can produce facial-feature embeddings that preserve identity information as much as possible and are insensitive to age variations. Specifically, on the one hand, a special network module is devised to implicitly purify the original facial features obtained from a face encoder. On the other hand, to obtain purer facial feature representations for age-invariant face recognition, irrelevant information within the implicitly purified features, such as the age, is further removed. This is realized by using a regularizer, based on information theory, to explicitly minimize the correlation between identity-related features and age-related features. Comprehensive ablation studies show that these two feature purification schemes can work independently, as well as collaboratively, to achieve better performance. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark data sets show that the IEFP method is on par with those competitors learned on far more favorable training samples, and it achieves the best performance in a fair comparison. Furthermore, we provide mathematical interpretation to explain the effectiveness of our approach, and find that it tends to generate low-rank, yet high-dimensional, representations for age-invariant face recognition.

      We propose a privacy-preserving Naive Bayes classifier and apply it to the problem of private text classification. In this setting, a party (Alice) holds a text message, while another party (Bob) holds a classifier. At the end of the protocol, Alice will only learn the result of the classifier applied to her text input and Bob learns nothing. Our solution is based on Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC). Our Rust implementation provides a fast and secure solution for the classification of unstructured text. Applying our solution to the case of spam detection (the solution is generic, and can be used in any other scenario in which the Naive Bayes classifier can be employed), we can classify an SMS as spam or ham in less than 340ms in the case where the dictionary size of Bob&#8217;s model includes all words ( $n = 5200$ ) and Alice&#8217;s SMS has at most $m = 160$ unigrams. In the case with $n = 369$ and $m = 8$ (the average of a spam SMS in the database), our solution takes only 21ms.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">

      In this paper, we propose a novel method for boundary detection in close-range hyperspectral images. This method can effectively predict the boundaries of objects of similar colour but different materials. To effectively extract the material information in the image, the spatial distribution of the spectral responses of different materials or endmembers is first estimated by hyperspectral unmixing. The resulting abundance map represents the fraction of each endmember spectra at each pixel. The abundance map is used as a supportive feature such that the spectral signature and the abundance vector for each pixel are fused to form a new spectral feature vector. Then different spectral similarity measures are adopted to construct a sparse spectral-spatial affinity matrix that characterizes the similarity between the spectral feature vectors of neighbouring pixels within a local neighborhood. After that, a spectral clustering method is adopted to produce eigenimages. Finally, the boundary map is constructed from the most informative eigenimages. We created a new HSI dataset and use it to compare the proposed method with four alternative methods, one for hyperspectral image and three for RGB image. The results exhibit that our method outperforms the alternatives and can cope with several scenarios that methods based on colour images cannot handle.

      Adaptive prediction is an important tool for efficient compression of non-stationary signals. A common approach to achieve adaptivity is to switch between a set of prediction modes, designed to capture variations in signal statistics. The design poses several challenges including: i) catastrophic instability due to statistical mismatch driven by propagation through the prediction loop, and ii) severe non-convexity of the cost surface that is often riddled with poor local minima. Motivated by these challenges, this paper presents a near-optimal method for designing prediction modes for adaptive compression. The proposed method builds on a stable, open-loop platform, but with a subterfuge that ensures that the design is asymptotically optimized for closed-loop operation. The non-convexity is handled by deterministic annealing, a powerful optimization tool to avoid poor local minima. To demonstrate the impact of the proposed approach on practical applications, we consider adaptive, transform-domain predictor design for enhancing standard video coding. Experimental results validate the benefits of the proposed design in terms of significant performance gains for both predictive compression systems in general and video coding in particular.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      In this paper, we make the first benchmark effort to elaborate on the superiority of using RAW images in the low light enhancement and develop a novel alternative route to utilize RAW images in a more flexible and practical way. Inspired by a full consideration on the typical image processing pipeline, we are inspired to develop a new evaluation framework, Factorized Enhancement Model (FEM), which decomposes the properties of RAW images into measurable factors and provides a tool for exploring how properties of RAW images affect the enhancement performance empirically. The empirical benchmark results show that the Linearity of data and Exposure Time recorded in meta-data play the most critical role, which brings distinct performance gains in various measures over the approaches taking the sRGB images as input. With the insights obtained from the benchmark results in mind, a RAW-guiding Exposure Enhancement Network (REENet) is developed, which makes trade-offs between the advantages and inaccessibility of RAW images in real applications in a way of using RAW images only in the training phase. REENet projects sRGB images into linear RAW domains to apply constraints with corresponding RAW images to reduce the difficulty of modeling training. After that, in the testing phase, our REENet does not rely on RAW images. Experimental results demonstrate not only the superiority of REENet to state-of-the-art sRGB-based methods and but also the effectiveness of the RAW guidance and all components.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      Existing Quality Assessment (QA) algorithms consider identifying &#8220;black-holes&#8221; to assess perceptual quality of 3D-synthesized views. However, advancements in rendering and inpainting techniques have made black-hole artifacts near obsolete. Further, 3D-synthesized views frequently suffer from stretching artifacts due to occlusion that in turn affect perceptual quality. Existing QA algorithms are found to be inefficient in identifying these artifacts, as has been seen by their performance on the IETR dataset. We found, empirically, that there is a relationship between the number of blocks with stretching artifacts in view and the overall perceptual quality. Building on this observation, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based algorithm that identifies the blocks with stretching artifacts and incorporates the number of blocks with the stretching artifacts to predict the quality of 3D-synthesized views. To address the challenge with existing 3D-synthesized views dataset, which has few samples, we collect images from other related datasets to increase the sample size and increase generalization while training our proposed CNN-based algorithm. The proposed algorithm identifies blocks with stretching distortions and subsequently fuses them to predict perceptual quality without reference, achieving improvement in performance compared to existing no-reference QA algorithms that are not trained on the IETR dataset. The proposed algorithm can also identify the blocks with stretching artifacts efficiently, which can further be used in downstream applications to improve the quality of 3D views.

      Two-dimensional "nanosheets" made of bonds between metal atoms and organic molecules are attractive candidates for photoelectric conversion, but get corroded easily. In a new study, scientists from Japan and Taiwan present a new nanosheet design using iron and benzene hexathiol that exhibits record stability to air exposure for 60 days, signaling the commercial optoelectronic applications of these 2D materials in the future.

      Repeatable, convergent outcomes are prima facie evidence for determinism in evolutionary processes. Among fishes, well-known examples include microevolutionary habitat transitions into the water column, where freshwater populations (e.g., sticklebacks, cichlids, and whitefishes) recurrently diverge toward slender-bodied pelagic forms and deep-bodied benthic forms. However, the consequences of such processes at deeper...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Pnas-RssFeedOfEarlyEditionArticles/~4/FgxKzBIPOmc" width="1">
