      Intel SGX enables memory isolation and static integrity verification of code and data stored in user-space memory regions called enclaves. SGX effectively shields the execution of enclaves from the underlying untrusted OS. Attackers cannot tamper nor examine enclaves' content. However, these properties equally challenge defenders as they are precluded from any provenance analysis to infer intrusions inside SGX enclaves. In this work, we propose SgxMonitor, a novel provenance analysis to monitor and identify anomalous executions of enclave code. To this end, we design a technique to extract contextual runtime information from an enclave and propose a novel model to represent enclaves' intrusions. Our experiments show that not only SgxMonitor incurs an overhead comparable to traditional provenance tools, but it also exhibits macro-benchmarks' overheads and slowdowns that marginally affect real use cases deployment. Our evaluation shows SgxMonitor successfully identifies enclave intrusions carried out by the state of the art attacks while reporting no false positives and negatives during normal enclaves executions, thus supporting the use of SgxMonitor in realistic scenarios.

<p>
      Deploying robust machine learning models has to account for concept drifts arising due to the dynamically changing and non-stationary nature of data. Addressing drifts is particularly imperative in the security domain due to the ever-evolving threat landscape and lack of sufficiently labeled training data at the deployment time leading to performance degradation. Recently proposed concept drift detection methods in literature tackle this problem by identifying the changes in feature/data distributions and periodically retraining the models to learn new concepts. While these types of strategies should absolutely be conducted when possible, they are not robust towards attacker-induced drifts and suffer from a delay in detecting new attacks. We aim to address these shortcomings in this work. we propose a robust drift detector that not only identifies drifted samples but also discovers new classes as they arrive in an on-line fashion. We evaluate the proposed method with two security-relevant data sets -- network intrusion data set released in 2018 and APT Command and Control dataset combined with web categorization data. Our evaluation shows that our drifting detection method is not only highly accurate but also robust towards adversarial drifts and discovers new classes from drifted samples.

      We study the privacy implications of training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with sensitive training datasets. Considering membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether or not specific data records have been used in training a given machine learning model, we provide empirical evidence that a neural network's architecture impacts its vulnerability to MIAs. In particular, we demonstrate that RNNs are subject to a higher attack accuracy than feed-forward neural network (FFNN) counterparts. Additionally, we study the effectiveness of two prominent mitigation methods for preempting MIAs, namely weight regularization and differential privacy. For the former, we empirically demonstrate that RNNs may only benefit from weight regularization marginally as opposed to FFNNs. For the latter, we find that enforcing differential privacy through either of the following two methods leads to a less favorable privacy-utility trade-off in RNNs than alternative FFNNs: (i) adding Gaussian noise to the gradients calculated during training as a part of the so-called DP-SGD algorithm and (ii) adding Gaussian noise to the trainable parameters as a part of a post-training mechanism that we propose. As a result, RNNs can also be less amenable to mitigation methods, bringing us to the conclusion that the privacy risks pertaining to the recurrent architecture are higher than the feed-forward counterparts.

      Algorithms such as Differentially Private SGD enable training machine learning models with formal privacy guarantees. However, there is a discrepancy between the protection that such algorithms guarantee in theory and the protection they afford in practice. An emerging strand of work empirically estimates the protection afforded by differentially private training as a confidence interval for the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ spent on training a model. Existing approaches derive confidence intervals for $\varepsilon$ from confidence intervals for the false positive and false negative rates of membership inference attacks. Unfortunately, obtaining narrow high-confidence intervals for $\epsilon$ using this method requires an impractically large sample size and training as many models as samples. We propose a novel Bayesian method that greatly reduces sample size, and adapt and validate a heuristic to draw more than one sample per trained model. Our Bayesian method exploits the hypothesis testing interpretation of differential privacy to obtain a posterior for $\varepsilon$ (not just a confidence interval) from the joint posterior of the false positive and false negative rates of membership inference attacks. For the same sample size and confidence, we derive confidence intervals for $\varepsilon$ around 40% narrower than prior work. The heuristic, which we adapt from label-only DP, can be used to further reduce the number of trained models needed to get enough samples by up to 2 orders of magnitude.

      Cyber security risk assessments provide a pivotal starting point towards the understanding of existing risk exposure, through which suitable mitigation strategies can be formed. Where risk is viewed as a product of threat, vulnerability, and impact, understanding each element is of equal importance. This can be a challenge in Industrial Control System (ICS) environments, where adopted technologies are typically not only bespoke, but interact directly with the physical world. To date, existing vulnerability identification has focused on traditional vulnerability categories. While this provides risk assessors with a baseline understanding, and the ability to hypothesize on potential resulting impacts, it is high level, operating at a level of abstraction that would be viewed as incomplete within a traditional information system context. The work presented in this paper takes the understanding of ICS device vulnerabilities one step further. It offers a tool, PLC-VBS, that helps identify Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) vulnerabilities, specifically within logic used to monitor, control, and automate operational processes. PLC-VBS gives risk assessors a more coherent picture about the potential impact should the identified vulnerabilities be exploited; this applies specifically to operational process elements.

      Prior to emergence of the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant, and at the time of the issuance of the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine, the efficacy of 2 doses of the 30-&#181;g vaccine in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age and of the 10-&#181;g dose in children 5 to 11 years of age were 100% (95% CI, 75.3%-100%) and 90.7% (95% CI, 67.7%-98.3%), respectively. However, 2 studies published in this issue of JAMA demonstrate that the estimated vaccine effectiveness among children and adolescents with Omicron is considerably lower than in the initial studies, and protection wanes rapidly, especially with the novel SARS-CoV-2 variants.

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and health-care use worldwide. COPD is caused by exposure to inhaled noxious particles, notably tobacco smoke and pollutants. However, the broad range of factors that increase the risk of development and progression of COPD throughout the life course are increasingly being recognised. Innovations in omics and imaging techniques have provided greater insight into disease pathobiology, which might result in advances in COPD prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

      An improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on Gaussian distribution model is proposed to realize the autotuning of weighting factors for the cost function design in the model predictive control method. First, the design principle of the weighting factors in model predictive torque control for permanent magnet synchronous motor system is analyzed. Then, using the root mean square of the current error in the two-phase rotating coordinate system and the system switching frequency as references, the objective function of the particles in the PSO is designed by considering the main control goals of reducing the torque ripple, the current total harmonic distortion, and the switching frequency. The Gaussian individual optimal distribution model is used to update the particle position on the structure of the conventional PSO algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method can solve the problem of weighting factors design as it reduces the switching frequency of the system while achieving excellent steady-state performance.

      Recently, model-based predictive current control (MB-PCC) has been presented as a good alternative to classical control algorithms in terms of simplicity and performance reliability. However, MB-PCC suffers from the high dependence on system parameters, which may deteriorate its performance under parameters variations. On the other hand, synchronous reluctance motors (SynRMs) are susceptible to suffer from inductances variations due to the magnetic saturation. Accordingly, in this article a new model-free predictive current control of SynRMs based on a recurrent neural network (RNN-PCC) is developed and proposed. The proposed RNN-PCC relies on the identification of the SynRM currents without considering any parameters. Simulation and experimental results show that both RNN-PCC and MB-PCC have similarly excellent dynamics, while better control performance and tracking errors can be achieved thanks to the proposed RNN-PCC.

      Due to a short-time gap breakdown in electrical discharge machining (EDM), a high dynamic response and flexible discharge current control ability are required for a pulse power generator. Therefore, a one-cycle control(OCC) of output current for a buck-type EDM pulse power generator is proposed. Considering the inductor current operating state, a full-range OCC current control is presented, and the Taylor expansion method is used for the duty cycle calculation. A duty cycle optimization strategy is proposed for transient states. Based on the small signal modeling, the dynamic response ability of the system is analyzed. The discharge current can switch from many transient states to a steady state in a few switching cycles without a current overshoot, and follow the average current reference well in the steady state.

The impedance measurement is an effective way to obtain the grid and inverter impedance by injecting a series of perturbations into the measured system. However, previous studies fail to fully consider the adverse grid voltage conditions; including harmonics, unbalance, frequency deviation, voltage sag, and phase jump; which may bring errors to the measured impedance. In this article, a cascaded delayed signal cancellation (CDSC)-based method is proposed to accurately obtain the impedance of the measured system under adverse grid voltage conditions. The proposed CDSC-based method is mainly composed of the perturbation extraction module (PEM) and frequency adaptive module (FAM). Different CDSC blocks are applied to implement the PEM and FAM to extract the injected perturbations adaptively, under various adverse grid voltage conditions. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiment results are presented to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed impedance measurement method.

      This articledemonstrates the developments toward a high-performance monolithic wheeled structure horizontal dual-axis [pitch (X-axis) and roll (Y-axis)] microelectromechanical system (MEMS) gyroscope based on off-plane coupling suppression silicon gratings. Gyroscopes have been fabricated with a silicon-on-glass fabrication process with vacuum sealed in metal packaging. The featured gyroscope operates in split mode with the bandwidths of two axes devices both of &#8764;70 Hz. By unitizing two individual active restraining control loops that adjust the quadrature amplitude via differentially biasing the silicon gratings in real time, the off-plane mechanical couplings of the two sense modes are significantly reduced by &#8764;95 and &#8764;30 times, which enables &#8764;25-fold and &#8764;56-fold improvements in the bias instability (BI) for a typical dual-axis device. Tactical-grade performances are achieved for both the X-axis and Y-axis gyroscopes with angle random walk of 0.02 deg/&#8730;h and 0.045 deg/&#8730;h along with in-run BI of 0.26 deg/h and 0.65 deg/h, respectively, without any temperature compensation. The current preliminary results show great potential to achieve navigation grade precision by employing the mode-matching technique in the future. The use of silicon gratings for out-of-plane coupling reduction also provides an effective way to build a high-performance planar monolithic chip inertial measurement unit.

        Social influence among people is widely understood to be a universal component of the human experience. However, studies of political behavior have generally approached social influence as specific to a type of behavior, such as voting, in a particular national context. There are good reasons to expect that social influence is observable across diverse behaviors and national contexts. In this study, we test this expectation using a two-wave panel survey of national samples in 19 countries. We employ autoregressive models that address some of the endogeneity challenges associated with attempts to measure social influence with survey designs. Our measure of social influence is predictive of diverse political behaviors in many countries with average effects comparable in size to important standard predictors of behavior.

        Governments rely on citizen compliance for official rules to be effective. Yet achieving compliance is often tricky, particular when individual costs are high. Under what conditions will citizens voluntarily respect collective rules? We explore public compliance with SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus) restrictions, focusing on the role of political trust. We anticipate that the effects of trust on compliance will be conditional on the presence of other factors, notably fear of infection. Low levels of fear may provide room for trust to shape compliance; yet high levels of fear may &#8216;crowd out&#8217; the role of trust. We hypothesize that, at the pandemic&#8217;s outset, compliance was likely to be shaped more by fear than by trust. Yet as the pandemic progressed, the impact of fear on compliance was likely to have weakened, and the impact of trust to have strengthened. These hypotheses are tested using longitudinal data from Austria, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

        Can non-citizen enfranchisement policies reduce the turnout gap between citizens with an immigration background and native citizen voters? While increasingly common in practice, there are only a handful of studies on the political consequences of non-citizen enfranchisement on voter mobilisation. Here, we examine the impact of non-citizen voting (NCV) rights on the political participation of citizens with and without an immigration background. Focusing on Switzerland, we use high-quality household panel data (SHP) from 1999 to 2014, leveraging both longitudinal and municipal level variation of enfranchisement laws when identifying their effect on turnout. We show that NCV rights boost political participation overall, and it particularly enhances turnout among citizens with an immigration background. Our analysis adds to existing theoretical explanations and empirical debates on representation and political participation in diverse democratic societies with large immigrant populations.

        In 2014, the USA initiated the formation of a multilateral military operation against Daesh in Syria and Iraq. Eventually, more than 70 states joined the anti-Daesh coalition. However, contributions to the military effort have been characterized by great variance, especially among EU member states. While some states took leading roles in the airstrikes, others provided training for Iraqi and Kurdish forces, and still others did not get involved beyond voicing their support for the policy. Against this backdrop, this article makes a two-fold contribution to the literature on military coalitions and security policy. Empirically, the article provides a mapping of the then 28 EU member states&#8217; military engagement in the fight against Daesh in Syria and Iraq. Analytically, fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) is applied to account for the observed pattern of military involvement, using an integrative framework that combines international and domestic factors. The results demonstrate that multiple paths led towards EU military involvement in the anti-Daesh coalition. At the same time, international-level incentives, such as external threat and/or alliance value feature prominently in all three identified paths. The analysis further underscores the value of a configurational perspective, because neither an external threat nor alliance value are sufficient on their own to bring about the outcome. Across the set-theoretic configurations, these conditions either combine with other &#8216;push&#8217; factors or with the absence of constraints against military involvement. In line with the latter, the article highlights the policy relevance of institutional constraints, especially legislative veto rights, since most of those countries that were involved in the airstrikes of the anti-Daesh coalition did not have formal parliamentary involvement on matters of military deployment policy.

      A new data retrieval approach utilizing selective staining is explored to differentiate &#8220;0&#8221; from &#8220;1&#8221; cells in EEPROM and Flash memory with node sizes of 40 nm and 250 nm. A two-step staining process based on selective oxide etching and copper galvanic displacement deposition is introduced. The underlying mechanism is attributed to the difference in electric field across the tunnel oxide, which originates from the presence or absence of charges stored in the floating gates. With proper sample preparation, the selectively stained and non-stained cells can be characterized with optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, to facilitate direct read-out of data in a time-efficient manner. The physical layout of individual memory cells with respect to the stored data is identified. A systematic data retrieval is achieved with an accuracy of 95% at individual bit level. This selective staining technique marks the data permanently on the chip that allows for subsequent analysis and evidence retention.

</p>

      Background clutters pose challenges to defocus blur detection. Existing approaches often produce artifact predictions in background areas with clutter and relatively low confident predictions in boundary areas. In this work, we tackle the above issues from two perspectives. Firstly, inspired by the recent success of self-attention mechanism, we introduce channel-wise and spatial-wise attention modules to attentively aggregate features at different channels and spatial locations to obtain more discriminative features. Secondly, we propose a generative adversarial training strategy to suppress spurious and low reliable predictions. This is achieved by utilizing a discriminator to identify predicted defocus map from ground-truth ones. As such, the defocus network (generator) needs to produce &#8216;realistic&#8217; defocus map to minimize discriminator loss. We further demonstrate that the generative adversarial training allows exploiting additional unlabeled data to improve performance, a.k.a. semi-supervised learning, and we provide the first benchmark on semi-supervised defocus detection. Finally, we demonstrate that the existing evaluation metrics for defocus detection generally fail to quantify the robustness with respect to thresholding. For a fair and practical evaluation, we introduce an effective yet efficient $AUF_beta $ metric. Extensive experiments on three public datasets verify the superiority of the proposed methods compared against state-of-the-art approaches.

      Three-dimensional (3-D) tracking in point cloud is a core competence of autonomous robots to perceive and forecast the environment. How to initialize bounding box seeds and optimize their position and orientation are very crucial for 3-D object tracking in point clouds. Nevertheless, existing methods mainly resort to developing a powerful classifier based on the initial bounding box seeds. In this article, we propose an end-to-end deep supervised descent method (SDM), which seamlessly integrates multiple seeds generation for the initialization of seeds and sequential updates for the estimation of accurate result. Specifically, we start with transforming the SDM iterative process into a trainable recurrent module. It explicitly learns a series of descent directions in the parameter space, to gradually optimize the initial seeds. Moreover, to alleviate drifting of this process, we initialize multiple seeds based on aggregated point sets generated by the deep Hough voting. Besides, a discrimination module is introduced to determine the bounding box with the highest score as the final result. Importantly, a specific multitask loss is proposed to train our model in an end-to-end way. Experiments on KITTI, PandaSet, and Waymo datasets show that our method could achieve significant improvements (up to 11.2% in success ratio) as compared to state-of-the-art trackers.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">

      This article investigates the distributed state estimation problem for large-scale power systems with the appearance of bad data. The power system is decomposed into several nonoverlapping agents and these agents interact with each other through transmission lines to form an interconnected multiagent power system (IMAPS). The measurement at each agent is local measurement, and the measurement in transmission line is edge measurement. To obtain an accurate state estimation of each agent in a distributed manner when the measurements are coupled with bad data, a bad data detection process should be designed. The difficulty is how to detect the bad data in edge measurement in a distributed scheme. To solve this problem, the characteristics of the edge measurement residual is analyzed, and a distributed bad data detection strategy is presented based on a novel iterative distributed Kalman-like filter (IDKF). It is proved that the IDKF algorithm can converge in finite steps when the communication graph of the IMAPS is acyclic, and the estimation accuracy is similar to that of the centralized Kalman filter. In addition, the IDKF algorithm shows excellent performance even when bad data appears. Simulation tests conducted on the IEEE 118-bus power system verify the theoretical findings.

      The power produced by a wind turbine depends on environmental conditions, working parameters, and interactions with nearby turbines. However, these aspects are often neglected in the design of data-driven models for wind farms&#8217; performance analysis. In this article, we propose to predict the active power and to provide reliable prediction intervals via ensembles of multivariate polynomial regression models that exploit a higher number of inputs (compared to most approaches in the literature), including operational and thermal variables. We present two main strategies: the former considers the environmental measurements collected at the other wind turbines in the farm as additional modeling information for the turbine under analysis; the latter combines multiple models relative to different operative conditions. We validate our approach on real data from the SCADA system of a wind farm in Italy and obtain a MAE of the order of 1.0% of the rated power of the turbine. Moreover, due to the structure of our approach, we can gain quantitative insights on the covariates most frequently selected depending on the working region of the wind turbines.

      Distributed energy sources including renewable energy (RE) sources and electric vehicle (EV) discharging offer opportunities to improve grid performance. Although uncoordinated EV charging can perfectly meet users&#8217; driving needs, it brings great challenges in maintaining the quality of low voltage (LV) distribution grids. Most existing EV control strategies do not take into account the heterogeneous nature of EV charging, including the various users&#8217; travel needs and the intermittent nature of RE sources. This article proposes a hierarchical control method that simultaneously coordinates EV charging by considering a dynamic energy tariff, RE sources, EV hardware characteristics, and particularly the EV&#8217;s driving needs. The proposed local controller sends the EV&#8217;s charging priority and required energy to the central controller based on the EV&#8217;s hardware characteristics and users&#8217; driving needs. The central controller then uses this information along with the energy tariff from the retailer and the present grid performance to control EV&#8217;s charging or discharging power. The efficacy of this hierarchical control method is evaluated using an Australian LV grid. The obtained results show that this method can reduce the neutral current and voltage imbalance with the maximized usage of renewable energy resources while the EV users&#8217; driving needs are met.

      Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to enhance the generalization capability of a certain model from a source domain to a target domain. Present UDA models focus on alleviating the domain shift by minimizing the feature discrepancy between the source domain and the target domain but usually ignore the class confusion problem. In this work, we propose an Inter-class Separation and Intra-class Aggregation (ISIA) mechanism. It encourages the cross-domain representative consistency between the same categories and differentiation among diverse categories. In this way, the features belonging to the same categories are aligned together and the confusable categories are separated. By measuring the align complexity of each category, we design an Adaptive-weighted Instance Matching (AIM) strategy to further optimize the instance-level adaptation. Based on our proposed methods, we also raise a hierarchical unsupervised domain adaptation framework for cross-domain semantic segmentation task. Through performing the image-level, feature-level, category-level and instance-level alignment, our method achieves a stronger generalization performance of the model from the source domain to the target domain. In two typical cross-domain semantic segmentation tasks, i.e., GTA $5rightarrow $ Cityscapes and SYNTHIA $rightarrow $ Cityscapes, our method achieves the state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy. We also build two cross-domain semantic segmentation datasets based on the publicly available data, i.e., remote sensing building segmentation and road segmentation, for domain adaptive segmentation. Our code, models and datasets are available at https://github.com/HibiscusYB/BAFFT.

      Cellular networks have been successfully evolved over the decades. Especially, Long-Term Evolution (LTE) has been exceedingly successful and the security threats against LTE systems have increased rapidly. Particularly, tracking LTE user devices has been shown to be effective as the temporary user identifiers (IDs) are easily extracted and used to locate targeted devices by passive eavesdroppers. We notice that naive approaches, such as frequent updates of temporary user IDs, are insufficient to mitigate user-tracking attacks since the new and old temporary IDs for the same user device are easily linkable by adversaries who can measure the wireless channel characteristics between the user device and herself. In this paper, we propose an opportunistic uplink power control scheme to minimize the probability of successful user tracking by an adversary whose location is unknown. We devise the notion of average inference error probability in order to measure the level of users&#8217; location privacy. Moreover, we derive the closed-form expression of the approximated average inference error probability and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average inference error probability under a constraint of an allowable power budget for each user. Against a passive adversary, our proposed power control scheme effectively degrades an adversary&#8217;s inference ability by 50% when 10 users are scheduled in each transmission time slot, which will lead to almost 100% inference error at the adversary over multiple time slots.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">

      Semi-supervised few-shot learning aims to improve the model generalization ability by means of both limited labeled data and widely-available unlabeled data. Previous works attempt to model the relations between the few-shot labeled data and extra unlabeled data, by performing a label propagation or pseudo-labeling process using an episodic training strategy. However, the feature distribution represented by the pseudo-labeled data itself is coarse-grained, meaning that there might be a large distribution gap between the pseudo-labeled data and the real query data. To this end, we propose a sample-centric feature generation (SFG) approach for semi-supervised few-shot image classification. Specifically, the few-shot labeled samples from different classes are initially trained to predict pseudo-labels for the potential unlabeled samples. Next, a semi-supervised meta-generator is utilized to produce derivative features centering around each pseudo-labeled sample, enriching the intra-class feature diversity. Meanwhile, the sample-centric generation constrains the generated features to be compact and close to the pseudo-labeled sample, ensuring the inter-class feature discriminability. Further, a reliability assessment (RA) metric is developed to weaken the influence of generated outliers on model learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed feature generation approach on challenging one- and few-shot image classification benchmarks.

      As cities become smarter, the importance of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) will be increasingly pronounced. To support latency- and time-sensitive applications, there have been attempts to utilize fog-cloud computing in VANETs. There are, however, a number of limitations in existing fog-cloud based VANET deployments, ranging from computation and communication bottlenecks to privacy leakage to costly certificate/ pseudonym management to key escrow, and so on. Therefore, in this paper we propose a privacy-preserving aggregation authentication scheme (PPAAS). The scheme is designed for deployment in a safety warning system for fog-cloud based VANETs. Specifically, the PPAAS scheme is realized using a novel efficient anonymous certificateless aggregation signcryption scheme (CASS) proposed in this paper, and allows a fog node to aggregate signcrypted traffic-related messages from surrounding vehicles into an aggregated ciphertext and unsigncrypt them in a batch. We then evaluate the security of PPAAS and demonstrate that it supports confidentiality, authentication, and (efficient) conditional privacy, and key escrow freeness. In particular, our scheme is the first in the literature to achieve efficient conditional privacy, which avoids the need for costly pseudonym management. We also demonstrate that the scheme is practical, based on our simulation results.

</p>

      This paper presents a new method, named implicit and explicit feature purification (IEFP), for age-invariant face recognition. Facial features extracted from a face image contain the information about the identity, age, and other attributes. For age-invariant face recognition, it is important to remove the irrelevant information, and retain the identity information only, in the facial features. Through the two proposed feature purification mechanisms, our framework can produce facial-feature embeddings that preserve identity information as much as possible and are insensitive to age variations. Specifically, on the one hand, a special network module is devised to implicitly purify the original facial features obtained from a face encoder. On the other hand, to obtain purer facial feature representations for age-invariant face recognition, irrelevant information within the implicitly purified features, such as the age, is further removed. This is realized by using a regularizer, based on information theory, to explicitly minimize the correlation between identity-related features and age-related features. Comprehensive ablation studies show that these two feature purification schemes can work independently, as well as collaboratively, to achieve better performance. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark data sets show that the IEFP method is on par with those competitors learned on far more favorable training samples, and it achieves the best performance in a fair comparison. Furthermore, we provide mathematical interpretation to explain the effectiveness of our approach, and find that it tends to generate low-rank, yet high-dimensional, representations for age-invariant face recognition.

      We propose a privacy-preserving Naive Bayes classifier and apply it to the problem of private text classification. In this setting, a party (Alice) holds a text message, while another party (Bob) holds a classifier. At the end of the protocol, Alice will only learn the result of the classifier applied to her text input and Bob learns nothing. Our solution is based on Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC). Our Rust implementation provides a fast and secure solution for the classification of unstructured text. Applying our solution to the case of spam detection (the solution is generic, and can be used in any other scenario in which the Naive Bayes classifier can be employed), we can classify an SMS as spam or ham in less than 340ms in the case where the dictionary size of Bob&#8217;s model includes all words ( $n = 5200$ ) and Alice&#8217;s SMS has at most $m = 160$ unigrams. In the case with $n = 369$ and $m = 8$ (the average of a spam SMS in the database), our solution takes only 21ms.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      In this paper, we propose a novel method for boundary detection in close-range hyperspectral images. This method can effectively predict the boundaries of objects of similar colour but different materials. To effectively extract the material information in the image, the spatial distribution of the spectral responses of different materials or endmembers is first estimated by hyperspectral unmixing. The resulting abundance map represents the fraction of each endmember spectra at each pixel. The abundance map is used as a supportive feature such that the spectral signature and the abundance vector for each pixel are fused to form a new spectral feature vector. Then different spectral similarity measures are adopted to construct a sparse spectral-spatial affinity matrix that characterizes the similarity between the spectral feature vectors of neighbouring pixels within a local neighborhood. After that, a spectral clustering method is adopted to produce eigenimages. Finally, the boundary map is constructed from the most informative eigenimages. We created a new HSI dataset and use it to compare the proposed method with four alternative methods, one for hyperspectral image and three for RGB image. The results exhibit that our method outperforms the alternatives and can cope with several scenarios that methods based on colour images cannot handle.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">

      Adaptive prediction is an important tool for efficient compression of non-stationary signals. A common approach to achieve adaptivity is to switch between a set of prediction modes, designed to capture variations in signal statistics. The design poses several challenges including: i) catastrophic instability due to statistical mismatch driven by propagation through the prediction loop, and ii) severe non-convexity of the cost surface that is often riddled with poor local minima. Motivated by these challenges, this paper presents a near-optimal method for designing prediction modes for adaptive compression. The proposed method builds on a stable, open-loop platform, but with a subterfuge that ensures that the design is asymptotically optimized for closed-loop operation. The non-convexity is handled by deterministic annealing, a powerful optimization tool to avoid poor local minima. To demonstrate the impact of the proposed approach on practical applications, we consider adaptive, transform-domain predictor design for enhancing standard video coding. Experimental results validate the benefits of the proposed design in terms of significant performance gains for both predictive compression systems in general and video coding in particular.
