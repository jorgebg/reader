      In this paper, we deal with a general distributed constrained online learning problem with privacy over time-varying networks, where a class of nondecomposable objective functions are considered. Under this setting, each node only controls a part of the global decision variable, and the goal of all nodes is to collaboratively minimize the global objective over a time horizon $T$ while guarantees the security of the transmitted information. For such problems, we first design a novel generic algorithm framework, named as DPSDA, of differentially private distributed online learning using the Laplace mechanism and the stochastic variants of dual averaging method. Then, we propose two algorithms, named as DPSDA-C and DPSDA-PS, under this framework. Theoretical results show that both algorithms attain an expected regret upper bound in $\mathcal{O}( \sqrt{T} )$ when the objective function is convex, which matches the best utility achievable by cutting-edge algorithms. Finally, numerical experiment results on both real-world and randomly generated datasets verify the effectiveness of our algorithms.

      Due to the rising concerns on privacy protection, how to build machine learning (ML) models over different data sources with security guarantees is gaining more popularity. Vertical federated learning (VFL) describes such a case where ML models are built upon the private data of different participated parties that own disjoint features for the same set of instances, which fits many real-world collaborative tasks. Nevertheless, we find that existing solutions for VFL either support limited kinds of input features or suffer from potential data leakage during the federated execution. To this end, this paper aims to investigate both the functionality and security of ML modes in the VFL scenario.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be specific, we introduce BlindFL, a novel framework for VFL training and inference. First, to address the functionality of VFL models, we propose the federated source layers to unite the data from different parties. Various kinds of features can be supported efficiently by the federated source layers, including dense, sparse, numerical, and categorical features. Second, we carefully analyze the security during the federated execution and formalize the privacy requirements. Based on the analysis, we devise secure and accurate algorithm protocols, and further prove the security guarantees under the ideal-real simulation paradigm. Extensive experiments show that BlindFL supports diverse datasets and models efficiently whilst achieves robust privacy guarantees.

      Differentially Private (DP) data release is a promising technique to disseminate data without compromising the privacy of data subjects. However the majority of prior work has focused on scenarios where a single party owns all the data. In this paper we focus on the multi-party setting, where different stakeholders own disjoint sets of attributes belonging to the same group of data subjects. Within the context of linear regression that allow all parties to train models on the complete data without the ability to infer private attributes or identities of individuals, we start with directly applying Gaussian mechanism and show it has the small eigenvalue problem. We further propose our novel method and prove it asymptotically converges to the optimal (non-private) solutions with increasing dataset size. We substantiate the theoretical results through experiments on both artificial and real-world datasets.

      Differentially private (DP) stochastic convex optimization (SCO) is ubiquitous in trustworthy machine learning algorithm design. This paper studies the DP-SCO problem with streaming data sampled from a distribution and arrives sequentially. We also consider the continual release model where parameters related to private information are updated and released upon each new data, often known as the online algorithms. Despite that numerous algorithms have been developed to achieve the optimal excess risks in different $\ell_p$ norm geometries, yet none of the existing ones can be adapted to the streaming and continual release setting. To address such a challenge as the online convex optimization with privacy protection, we propose a private variant of online Frank-Wolfe algorithm with recursive gradients for variance reduction to update and reveal the parameters upon each data. Combined with the adaptive differential privacy analysis, our online algorithm achieves in linear time the optimal excess risk when $1&lt;p\leq 2$ and the state-of-the-art excess risk meeting the non-private lower ones when $2&lt;p\leq\infty$. Our algorithm can also be extended to the case $p=1$ to achieve nearly dimension-independent excess risk. While previous variance reduction results on recursive gradient have theoretical guarantee only in the independent and identically distributed sample setting, we establish such a guarantee in a non-stationary setting. To demonstrate the virtues of our method, we design the first DP algorithm for high-dimensional generalized linear bandits with logarithmic regret. Comparative experiments with a variety of DP-SCO and DP-Bandit algorithms exhibit the efficacy and utility of the proposed algorithms.

      Graph-based anomaly detection is becoming prevalent due to the powerful representation abilities of graphs as well as recent advances in graph mining techniques. These GAD tools, however, expose a new attacking surface, ironically due to their unique advantage of being able to exploit the relations among data. That is, attackers now can manipulate those relations (i.e., the structure of the graph) to allow target nodes to evade detection or degenerate the classification performance of the detection. In this paper, we exploit this vulnerability by designing the structural poisoning attacks to a FeXtra-based GAD system termed OddBall as well as the black box attacks against GCN-based GAD systems by attacking the imbalanced lienarized GCN ( LGCN ). Specifically, we formulate the attack against OddBall and LGCN as a one-level optimization problem by incorporating different regression techniques, where the key technical challenge is to efficiently solve the problem in a discrete domain. We propose a novel attack method termed BinarizedAttack based on gradient descent. Comparing to prior arts, BinarizedAttack can better use the gradient information, making it particularly suitable for solving discrete optimization problems, thus opening the door to studying a new type of attack against security analytic tools that rely on graph data.

      Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown huge therapeutical potential in the treatment of aggressive B-cell lymphomas beyond second-line of therapy.1&#8211;3 But the use of such therapies as a second-line of therapy is a current matter of debate. At the 2021 American Society of Hematology meeting, results of the three randomised clinical trials addressing this question were presented. The ZUMA7,4 BELINDA,5 and the TRANSFORM6 trials included only patients with aggressive B-cell lymphomas with primary refractory disease or with relapse within 12 months of completion of first-line therapy.

<p>
      Rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) will be increasingly utilized by residential customers due to their economic and environmental benefits. However, the intermittent power produced by PVs and the additional loads required for the PEV charging can cause power quality disturbances in the low-voltage distribution networks (LVDN). An adaptable correlated control (ACC) is proposed for the decoupled optimization of the active and reactive power, where energy cost can be minimized through the local demand-side management (DSM) of residential loads. Further, the optimal allocation of the sparse capacity of inverters for reactive power compensation to maintain the voltage variations and the mitigation of voltage unbalances within the allowable limits is proposed. The proposed ACC provides a supervisory control to observe and modify the voltage quality of the LVDN without the need for real-time collaboration between controllers. The impacts of the integration of installed rooftop PVs and PEV charging for unbalanced three-phase LVDNs are assessed rigorously using a versatile simulation platform. Also, the suitability of the proposed control strategy for DSM and the alleviation of voltage fluctuations and unbalances are assessed.

      N OWADAYS, billions of devices are connected to the In-ternet, enabling Internet of Things (IoT) systems widely deployed, such as smart city, smart healthcare and intelligent plant, to capture a great quantity of sensing data. Consequently, the data transmission, processing and analysis in IoT applications bring a great pressure to the central server. Fortunately, distributed intelligence becomes one of the potential solutions. Distributed intelligence can greatly relieve server pressures via plenty of terminal devices, and these devices collaboratively perceive and handle the mass data to improve the reliability, s-calability and security of industrial IoT systems. As future IoT system will embrace more wireless sensors and devices, the high-performance computing, high-bandwidth and low-latency communication are excessively required, many new research opportunities and challenges for distributed intelligence over Internet of things have arisen. To promote the development of distributed intelligence technology, this special section (SS) focuses on various technologies and platforms regarding industrial IoT systems. This special section received nearly 50 submitted manuscripts, out of which 10 of them have been accepted after a rigorous peer review. Each manuscript is reviewed by multiple rounds of review with at least three or four reviewers, the problems to be solved and the innovation of each manuscript are mainly concerned. Then the accepted papers are summarized as follows in details. Considering the joint optimization of the offloading decision and resource allocation under limited resource constraints in collaborative edge computing networks with multiple IIoT devices and MEC servers, an improved differential evolution algorithm [7] is proposed to minimize the weighted sum of cost of energy consumption and time delay, which can effectively reduce the system delay and energy consumption. In order to improve the performance of task scheduling in cloud computing- Attiya et al. [1] propose a novel hybrid swarm intelligence method MRFOSSA, which uses a modified Manta-Ray Foraging Optimizer (MRFO) and the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA). MRFOSSA is superior to other methods in terms of makespan time and cloud throughput. The research goal of the paper [5] is to design an intelligent computing offloading strategy for industrial applications in order to optimize costs and mitigate energy losses. Then the paper proposes to combine a fog controller and AI-based learning techniques so that the fog controller can intelligently assign tasks to the most appropriate fog devices and find the appropriate path to the target. Considering the resource utilization efficiency under dynamic overload requests and network states in IIoT, Chen et al. [2] propose DRL-based intelligent SFC orchestration scheme and jointly optimize the VNF deployment and SFC embedment by the improved DDQN algorithm, which can improve the performance of resource utilization rate, execution cost and delay compared with other representative schemes. To solve the problem of resource allocation and energy cost in Internet of Vehicles, Kong et al. [8] design a joint computing and caching framework and formulate the problem as a reinforcement learning problem to minimize the energy cost. On this basis, the optimization algorithm based on DDPG is proposed, which can effectively decrease energy costs. To reduce the query numbers of the object model when constructing adversarial examples, Zhang et al. [10] propose generating adversarial examples with shadow model (GASM), i.e., transfering the query operations to the designed shadow model, which can achieve high attack success rates. Chen et al. [3] revise a Decentralized-Wireless-Federated-Learning algorithm (DWFL) which utilizes the superposition property of the analog scheme. It can solve the problem of single failure, limited bandwidth resource and privacy protection in wireless federated learning algorithm, which can be appli

      Security in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is vital as there are some cases where IIoT devices collect sensory information for crucial social production and life. Thus, designing secure and efficient communication channels is always a research hotspot. However, end devices have memory, computation, and power-supplying capacities limitations. Moreover, perfect forward secrecy (PFS), which means that long-term key exposure still discloses previous session keys, is a critical security property for authentication and key exchange (AKE). This article proposes an AKE protocol named SAKE* for the IIoT environment, where two types of keys (i.e., a master key and an evolution key) guarantee PFS. In addition, the SAKE* protocol merely uses concatenation, XOR, and hash-function operations to achieve lightweight authentication, key exchange, and message integrity. We also compare the SAKE* protocol with seven current and IoT-related authentication protocols regarding security properties and performance. Comparison results indicate that the SAKE* protocol consumes the least computation resource and third-least communication cost among eight AKE protocols while equipping 12 security properties.

      An interval breast cancer is defined as a breast cancer that arises in a patient after negative results on a screening examination and before the next scheduled screening. Typically, an interval cancer is identified when the patient presents with signs or symptoms: a new palpable abnormality, breast discharge, or other change in the breast that would prompt the patient to seek medical care. In essence, interval cancers are a result of screening failures. Therefore, reduction of this subset of cancers is a desired goal of screening.

      Luis L C Correia and colleagues 1 filled their Correspondence with malicious and false information. Although they claimed to have no competing interests, at least two of them were directly involved in the approval of the recommendations proposed in the Brazilian guideline for COVID-19 outpatient treatment (which would only become guidelines if approved by the Brazilian National Secretary of Science, Technology, Innovation, and Strategic Products in Healthcare). These recommendations were disapproved because of too many inconsistencies, including meta-analyses with low statistical power.

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and health-care use worldwide. COPD is caused by exposure to inhaled noxious particles, notably tobacco smoke and pollutants. However, the broad range of factors that increase the risk of development and progression of COPD throughout the life course are increasingly being recognised. Innovations in omics and imaging techniques have provided greater insight into disease pathobiology, which might result in advances in COPD prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

      With the loss of a large number of space vectors under switch open-circuit faults, the neutral point potential (NPP) control of T-type three-level converters is faced with a huge challenge. It becomes harsh to balance the NPP and maintain the symmetry of line voltages under switch open-circuit faults simultaneously. In order to improve the NPP control performance and stable operation of T-type three-level converters, this article presents a hybrid modulation strategy that can enhance the NPP control ability even under switch open-circuit faults. Through a carrier-based analysis tool, two candidate modulation strategies are first evaluated from the perspective of the adjustment range of the neutral point current. The first one maintains the conventional three-level modulation in two nonfault phase arms. The second one degrades the mode of modulation from three-level modulation to two-level modulation in two nonfault phase arms. By making full use of the NPP oscillation characteristics of the two candidate methods, a hybrid modulation strategy based on transition duty-cycle and enabled bridge-arm adjustment is put forward to achieve a comprehensive optimal control performance. Numerical analysis and experiments are carried on to prove the correctness and feasibility of the proposed method.

</p>

<p>
      An improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on Gaussian distribution model is proposed to realize the autotuning of weighting factors for the cost function design in the model predictive control method. First, the design principle of the weighting factors in model predictive torque control for permanent magnet synchronous motor system is analyzed. Then, using the root mean square of the current error in the two-phase rotating coordinate system and the system switching frequency as references, the objective function of the particles in the PSO is designed by considering the main control goals of reducing the torque ripple, the current total harmonic distortion, and the switching frequency. The Gaussian individual optimal distribution model is used to update the particle position on the structure of the conventional PSO algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method can solve the problem of weighting factors design as it reduces the switching frequency of the system while achieving excellent steady-state performance.

<p>
      In this article, a fully soft switched interleaved bidirectional buck/boost converter with high voltage conversion ratio (VCR) and no pulsating current at low voltage source is proposed. Winding cross-coupled inductors technique is employed in order to increase VCR and mitigate current ripple at low voltage side. Moreover, soft switching conditions for all semiconductor devices are provided and the leakage inductances energy of coupled inductors are absorbed in both high step-up/down operating modes. Furthermore, the reverse recovery problem of all diodes is removed due to zero current switching turn off. All the mentioned advantages are achieved for a bidirectional converter with two interleaved phases in both high step-up/down operating modes by only one clamp circuit consisting of a clamp capacitor and two active switches. Also, the body diodes of the main switches are utilized as the main diodes to reduce the element count. The converter performance is validated by theoretical analysis and an 800 W prototype circuit in both operating modes.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      Due to a short-time gap breakdown in electrical discharge machining (EDM), a high dynamic response and flexible discharge current control ability are required for a pulse power generator. Therefore, a one-cycle control(OCC) of output current for a buck-type EDM pulse power generator is proposed. Considering the inductor current operating state, a full-range OCC current control is presented, and the Taylor expansion method is used for the duty cycle calculation. A duty cycle optimization strategy is proposed for transient states. Based on the small signal modeling, the dynamic response ability of the system is analyzed. The discharge current can switch from many transient states to a steady state in a few switching cycles without a current overshoot, and follow the average current reference well in the steady state.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      The wide bandwidth impedance of grid and inverter are the critical parameters for small-signal stability analysis and control optimization of grid-tied inverter systems. The impedance measurement is an effective way to obtain the grid and inverter impedance by injecting a series of perturbations into the measured system. However, previous studies fail to fully consider the adverse grid voltage conditions; including harmonics, unbalance, frequency deviation, voltage sag, and phase jump; which may bring errors to the measured impedance. In this article, a cascaded delayed signal cancellation (CDSC)-based method is proposed to accurately obtain the impedance of the measured system under adverse grid voltage conditions. The proposed CDSC-based method is mainly composed of the perturbation extraction module (PEM) and frequency adaptive module (FAM). Different CDSC blocks are applied to implement the PEM and FAM to extract the injected perturbations adaptively, under various adverse grid voltage conditions. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiment results are presented to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed impedance measurement method.

<div class="abstract">
      <p>
        Little is known about whether and under which conditions populist radical right parties&#8217; (PRRPs&#8217;) nativist welfare politics matters to the voters. I address this gap in the research and test the argument that the electoral appeal of this electoral discourse varies among welfare regimes. The study compares the conservative and social-democratic welfare regimes and focuses on the vote choices of the two core constituencies of PRRPs &#8211; economically exposed and immigration-sceptic voters. The results show that these electorates support PRRPs&#8217; nativist welfare positions for very different reasons in the two welfare regimes. First, in the conservative regime, economically exposed citizens vote for PRRPs, the more they stress nativism and welfare expansion. By contrast, in the social-democratic regime this group of voters is more likely to support positions combining nativism and dismantled welfare benefits. Second, immigrant-sceptic voters in the social-democratic regime support PRRPs who pledge to preserve the welfare state, and increased migration considerably boosts the probability that they do so. By contrast, this group of voters in the conservative regime is more likely to support PRRPs who seek to partly dismantle the welfare state, and the inflow of immigrants is unrelated to these choices. These results have important implications and suggest that welfare regimes moderate public opinion differently in the current age of populism compared to previous eras.

<div class="abstract">
      <p>
        In 2014, the USA initiated the formation of a multilateral military operation against Daesh in Syria and Iraq. Eventually, more than 70 states joined the anti-Daesh coalition. However, contributions to the military effort have been characterized by great variance, especially among EU member states. While some states took leading roles in the airstrikes, others provided training for Iraqi and Kurdish forces, and still others did not get involved beyond voicing their support for the policy. Against this backdrop, this article makes a two-fold contribution to the literature on military coalitions and security policy. Empirically, the article provides a mapping of the then 28 EU member states&#8217; military engagement in the fight against Daesh in Syria and Iraq. Analytically, fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) is applied to account for the observed pattern of military involvement, using an integrative framework that combines international and domestic factors. The results demonstrate that multiple paths led towards EU military involvement in the anti-Daesh coalition. At the same time, international-level incentives, such as external threat and/or alliance value feature prominently in all three identified paths. The analysis further underscores the value of a configurational perspective, because neither an external threat nor alliance value are sufficient on their own to bring about the outcome. Across the set-theoretic configurations, these conditions either combine with other &#8216;push&#8217; factors or with the absence of constraints against military involvement. In line with the latter, the article highlights the policy relevance of institutional constraints, especially legislative veto rights, since most of those countries that were involved in the airstrikes of the anti-Daesh coalition did not have formal parliamentary involvement on matters of military deployment policy.

<div class="abstract">
      <p>
        How do coalitional dynamics matter for the capacity of states to maintain social inclusion in coordinated models of capitalism? Taking its departure in scholarship emphasizing the influence of employers on the extent of state intervention in post-industrial economies, this paper argues that employer influence depends on which actors they team up with &#8211; unions or parties. If unions depend on employers for their organizational influence in a policy field, unions become a strong coalitional partner for employers in weakening demands for inclusiveness from the parliamentary arena. Conversely, if unions have influence independent of any coalition with employers, both unions and employers are likely to team up with political parties aligned with their preferences. This makes the level of inclusion resulting from increased state intervention more fluctuating, depending on who holds government power. A comparative study of reforms of Danish and Austrian vocational education institutions corroborates the empirical purchase of the argument.

      <p>
        While there has been a veritable boom in literature on organized interests, their lobbying strategies, relationships with decision-makers, and their impact on policymaking, only a few studies have explored internal organizational developments and, specifically, the professionalization of interest groups. The present study focuses on the national and transnational factors driving the professionalization of interest groups in Central and Eastern Europe, a region previously neglected in much of the interest group literature. Based on a sample of more than 400 surveyed organizations operating in Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovenia in the healthcare, higher education, and energy sectors, we explore three bundles of factors potentially enhancing the professionalization of interest groups &#8211; organizational funding sources, national and transnational intergroup cooperation and organizations&#8217; standing in the domestic interest group system. Our statistical analyses show that state subsidies and tight policy coordination with the state are crucial drivers of internal organizational professionalization, suggesting rather patronistic and symbiotic relationships between the state and certain organizations. However, our data also support the notion that interorganizational collaboration, both at the national and international levels, may also be key to organizational professionalization, enabling groups that lack close ties with the state to compensate their disadvantage with intensive domestic and international networking. The study is also among the first to link increasing professionalization with organizational population density.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      Zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR) has attracted great attention recently, due to the potential application of sketch-based retrieval under zero-shot scenarios, where the categories of query sketches and gallery photos are not observed in the training stage. However, it is still under insufficient exploration for the general and practical scenario when the query sketches and gallery photos contain both seen and unseen categories. Such a problem is defined as generalized zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (GZS-SBIR), which is the focus of this work. To this end, we propose a novel Augmented Multi-modality Fusion (AMF) framework to generalize seen concepts to unobserved ones efficiently. Specifically, a novel knowledge discovery module named cross-domain augmentation is designed in both visual and semantic space to mimic novel knowledge unseen from the training stage, which is the key to handling the GZS-SBIR challenge. Moreover, a triplet domain alignment module is proposed to couple the cross-domain distribution between photo and sketch in visual space. To enhance the robustness of our model, we explore embedding propagation to refine both visual and semantic features by removing undesired noise. Eventually, visual-semantic fusion representations are concatenated for further domain discrimination and task-specific recognition, which tend to trigger the cross-domain alignment in both visual and semantic feature space. Experimental evaluations are conducted on popular ZS-SBIR benchmarks as well as a new evaluation protocol designed for GZS-SBIR from DomainNet dataset with more diverse sub-domains, and the promising results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution over other baselines. The source code is available at https://github.com/scottjingtt/AMF_GZS_SBIR.git.

      The power produced by a wind turbine depends on environmental conditions, working parameters, and interactions with nearby turbines. However, these aspects are often neglected in the design of data-driven models for wind farms&#8217; performance analysis. In this article, we propose to predict the active power and to provide reliable prediction intervals via ensembles of multivariate polynomial regression models that exploit a higher number of inputs (compared to most approaches in the literature), including operational and thermal variables. We present two main strategies: the former considers the environmental measurements collected at the other wind turbines in the farm as additional modeling information for the turbine under analysis; the latter combines multiple models relative to different operative conditions. We validate our approach on real data from the SCADA system of a wind farm in Italy and obtain a MAE of the order of 1.0% of the rated power of the turbine. Moreover, due to the structure of our approach, we can gain quantitative insights on the covariates most frequently selected depending on the working region of the wind turbines.

      Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) is an emerging secure distributed learning paradigm that aggregates user-trained local gradients into a federated model through a cryptographic protocol. Unfortunately, PPFL is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks launched by a Byzantine adversary, who crafts malicious local gradients to harm the accuracy of the federated model. To resist model poisoning attacks, existing defense strategies focus on identifying suspicious local gradients over plaintexts. However, the Byzantine adversary submits encrypted poisonous gradients to circumvent existing defense strategies in PPFL, resulting in encrypted model poisoning. To address the issue, in this paper we design a privacy-preserving defense strategy using two-trapdoor homomorphic encryption (referred to as ShieldFL), which can resist encrypted model poisoning without compromising privacy in PPFL. Specially, we first present the secure cosine similarity method aiming to measure the distance between two encrypted gradients. Then, we propose the Byzantine-tolerance aggregation using cosine similarity, which can achieve robustness for both Independently Identically Distribution (IID) and non-IID data. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets (i.e., MNIST, KDDCup99, and Amazon) show that ShieldFL outperforms existing defense strategies. Especially, ShieldFL can achieve 30%-80% accuracy improvement to defend two state-of-the-art model poisoning attacks in both non-IID and IID settings.

      When public clouds become the platform of choice for MapReduce processing, users are placing higher demands on the privacy of the job data and program. A number of solutions employed trusted hardware to protect MapReduce tasks. However, existing works pointed out that simply protecting individual nodes in the MapReduce cluster with trusted hardware and protecting cross-node communication with encryption still leak information from side-channels. Specifically, attackers can derive data information by observing and manipulating cross-node communication traffic volumes. Although existing works proposed some solutions to prevent such leakage, in this paper, we show that previous solutions still leak critical job information. Additionally, our study shows that previous solutions have limitations from other aspects, including data restriction, partition function restriction, reliability issue, and high overheads. To address all the discovered limitations, we introduced the Strong Shuffle solution. Our analysis and experimental results showed that our solution has reduced the information leakage and addressed other discovered limitations. To support Strong Shuffle, we proposed a variant Bloom Filter, named Group-based Dynamic Bloom Filter (GDBF). Our theoretical analysis showed that GDBF has lower performance and storage overhead than the traditional Scalable Bloom Filter.

      Cloud storage is more and more prevalent in practice, and thus how to check its integrity becomes increasingly essential. A classical solution is identity-based (ID-based) provable data possession (PDP), which supports certificateless cloud storage auditing without entire user data. However, existing ID-PDP protocols always require that cloud users outsource data blocks, authenticators and a small-sized file tag to the cloud, and make use of the heavy elliptic curve cryptography over bilinear pairing. These disadvantages would result in vast storage, communication, and computation costs, which is unexpected, especially for resource-limited cloud users. To improve the performance, this paper proposes a novel cryptographic primitive: ID-based PDP with compressed cloud storage. In this model, cloud storage auditing can be achieved by using only encrypted data blocks in a self-verified way, and original data blocks can be reconstructed from the outsourced data. Thus, data owners no longer need to store original data blocks on the cloud. We also use some basic algebraic operations to realize a concrete ID-based PDP protocol with compressed cloud storage, which is quite efficient due to no heavy cryptographic operations involved. The proposed protocol can easily be extended to support the other practical functions by using the primitive replacement technique. The proposed protocol is strictly proven to have the properties of correctness, privacy, unforgeability and detectability. Finally, we give plenty of theoretical analysis and experimental results to validate the efficiency of the proposed protocol.

<div class="itemdescription">

      It has been widely observed that deep neural networks are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. Decision-based attacks could generate adversarial examples based solely on top-1 labels returned by the target model. However, they typically make excessive queries and could not bypass detection effectively. To comprehensively assess a decision-based attack, besides its query efficiency, the performance against detection is also a concern. Considering that previous detections consume massive resources and always mistakenly recognize benign video frames as malicious attacks, we design a lightweight detection called boundary detection to overcome the above limitations, whose success reveals serious limitations of existing decision-based attacks. To develop more powerful attacks, we first present f-mixup as a basic method to produce candidate adversarial examples in the frequency domain. Using f-mixup as the building block, we propose f-attack as a complete decision-based attack. With the help of several natural images, f-attack could both work well with limited (hundreds of) queries and bypass detection effectively. Nevertheless, if the attacker could make relatively adequate (thousands of) queries and the target model is not equipped with detection, f-attack will lag behind existing decision-based attacks. We additionally introduce frequency binary search based on f-mixup, which serves as a plug-and-play module for existing decision-based attacks to further improve their query efficiency. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      Semi-supervised few-shot learning aims to improve the model generalization ability by means of both limited labeled data and widely-available unlabeled data. Previous works attempt to model the relations between the few-shot labeled data and extra unlabeled data, by performing a label propagation or pseudo-labeling process using an episodic training strategy. However, the feature distribution represented by the pseudo-labeled data itself is coarse-grained, meaning that there might be a large distribution gap between the pseudo-labeled data and the real query data. To this end, we propose a sample-centric feature generation (SFG) approach for semi-supervised few-shot image classification. Specifically, the few-shot labeled samples from different classes are initially trained to predict pseudo-labels for the potential unlabeled samples. Next, a semi-supervised meta-generator is utilized to produce derivative features centering around each pseudo-labeled sample, enriching the intra-class feature diversity. Meanwhile, the sample-centric generation constrains the generated features to be compact and close to the pseudo-labeled sample, ensuring the inter-class feature discriminability. Further, a reliability assessment (RA) metric is developed to weaken the influence of generated outliers on model learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed feature generation approach on challenging one- and few-shot image classification benchmarks.

</p>

      It is crucial to protect users&#8217; location traces against inference attacks on aggregate mobility data collected from multiple users in various real-world applications. Most of the existing works on aggregate mobility data are focusing on inference attacks rather than designing privacy-preserving release mechanisms, and a few differential private release mechanisms suffer from poor utility-privacy tradeoffs. In this paper, we propose optimal centralized privacy-preserving aggregate mobility data release mechanisms (PAMDRMs) that minimize the leakage from an information-theoretic perspective by releasing perturbed versions of the raw aggregate location. Specifically, we use mutual information to measure user-level and aggregate-level privacy leakage separately, and formulate leakage minimization problems under utility constraints. As directly solving the optimization problems incur exponential complexity w.r.t. users&#8217; trace length, we transform them into belief state Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), with a focus on the MDP formulation for the user-level privacy problem. We build reinforcement learning (RL) models and leverage the efficient Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic RL algorithm to derive the solutions to the MDPs as our optimal PAMDRMs. We compare them with two state-of-the-art privacy protection mechanisms PDPR (context-aware local design) and DMLM (context-free centralized design) in terms of mutual information leakage and adversary&#8217;s attack success (evaluated by her expected estimation error and Jensen-Shannon Divergence-based error). Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the user-level PAMDRM performs the best on both measures thanks to its context-aware property and centralized design. Even though the aggregate-level PAMDRM achieves better privacy-utility tradeoff than the other two, it does not always perform better than them on adversarial suc- ess, highlighting the necessity of considering privacy measures from different perspectives to avoid overestimating the level of privacy offered to users. Lastly, we discuss an alternative, fully data-driven approach to derive the optimal PAMDRM by leveraging adversarial training on limited data samples.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      Recent studies have pointed out that many well-developed Visual Question Answering (VQA) models are heavily affected by the language prior problem. It refers to making predictions based on the co-occurrence pattern between textual questions and answers instead of reasoning upon visual contents. To tackle this problem, most existing methods focus on strengthening the visual feature learning capability to reduce this text shortcut influence on model decisions. However, few efforts have been devoted to analyzing its inherent cause and providing an explicit interpretation. It thus lacks a good guidance for the research community to move forward in a purposeful way, resulting in model construction perplexity towards overcoming this non-trivial problem. In this paper, we propose to interpret the language prior problem in VQA from a class-imbalance view. Concretely, we design a novel interpretation scheme whereby the loss of mis-predicted frequent and sparse answers from the same question type is distinctly exhibited during the late training phase. It explicitly reveals why the VQA model tends to produce a frequent yet obviously wrong answer, to a given question whose right answer is sparse in the training set. Based upon this observation, we further propose a novel loss re-scaling approach to assign different weights to each answer according to the training data statistics for estimating the final loss. We apply our approach into six strong baselines and the experimental results on two VQA-CP benchmark datasets evidently demonstrate its effectiveness. In addition, we also justify the validity of the class imbalance interpretation scheme on other computer vision tasks, such as face recognition and image classification.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">

      The cross-domain image captioning, which is trained on a source domain and generalized to other domains, usually faces the large domain shift problem. Although prior work has attempted to leverage both paired source and unpaired target data to minimize this shift, the performance is still unsatisfactory. One main reason lies in the large discrepancy in language expression between two domains, where diverse language styles are adopted to describe an image from different views, resulting in different semantic descriptions for an image. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a Style-based Cross-domain Image Captioner (SCIC) which incorporates the discriminative style information into the encoder-decoder framework, and interprets an image as a special sentence according to external style instructions. Technically, we design a novel &#8220;Instruction-based LSTM&#8221;, which adds the instruct gate to collect a style instruction, and then outputs a specified format according to that instruction. Two objectives are designed to train I-LSTM: 1) generating correct image descriptions and 2) generating correct styles, thus the model is expected to accurately capture the semantic meanings of an image by the special caption as well as understand the syntactic structure of the caption. We use MS-COCO as the source domain, and Oxford-102, CUB-200, Flickr30k as the target domains. Experimental results demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms the previous methods, and the style information incorporating with I-LSTM significantly improves the performance, with 5% CIDEr improvements at least on all datasets.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>
      In this work, we propose a non-linear hyperbolic-parabolic coupled Partial Differential Equation (PDE) based model for image despeckling. Here, a separate equation is used to calculate the edge variable, which improves the quality of edge information in the despeckled images. The existence of the weak solution of the present system is achieved via Schauder fixed point theorem. We used a generalized weighted average finite-difference scheme and the Gauss-Seidel iterative technique to solve the coupled system. Numerical studies are reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach with respect to standard PDE-based and nonlocal methods available in the literature. Numerical experiments are performed over gray-level images degraded by artificial speckle noise. Additionally, we investigate the noise removal efficiency of the proposed algorithm when applied to real synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Ultrasound images. Overall, our study confirms that in most cases, the present model performs better than the other PDE-based models and shows competitive performance with the nonlocal technique. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed despeckling approach is the first work that utilizes the advantage of the non-linear coupled hyperbolic-parabolic PDEs for image despeckling.

      A team of astronomers has released new observations of nearby galaxies that resemble colourful cosmic fireworks. The images, obtained with the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (ESO's VLT), show different components of the galaxies in distinct colours, allowing astronomers to pinpoint the locations of young stars and the gas they warm up around them.

      Repeatable, convergent outcomes are prima facie evidence for determinism in evolutionary processes. Among fishes, well-known examples include microevolutionary habitat transitions into the water column, where freshwater populations (e.g., sticklebacks, cichlids, and whitefishes) recurrently diverge toward slender-bodied pelagic forms and deep-bodied benthic forms. However, the consequences of such processes at deeper...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Pnas-RssFeedOfEarlyEditionArticles/~4/FgxKzBIPOmc" width="1">
