<div class="itemdescription">
<p>When collecting information, local differential privacy (LDP) relieves the
concern of privacy leakage from users' perspective, as user's private
information is randomized before sent to the aggregator. We study the problem
of recovering the distribution over a numerical domain while satisfying LDP.
While one can discretize a numerical domain and then apply the protocols
developed for categorical domains, we show that taking advantage of the
numerical nature of the domain results in better trade-off of privacy and
utility. We introduce a new reporting mechanism, called the square wave SW
mechanism, which exploits the numerical nature in reporting. We also develop an
Expectation Maximization with Smoothing (EMS) algorithm, which is applied to
aggregated histograms from the SW mechanism to estimate the original
distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach, SW
with EMS, consistently outperforms other methods in a variety of utility
metrics.

<p>Binary analysis is traditionally used in the realm of malware detection.
However, the same technique may be employed by an attacker to analyze the
original binaries in order to reverse engineer them and extract exploitable
weaknesses. When a binary is distributed to end users, it becomes a common
remotely exploitable attack point. Code obfuscation is used to hinder reverse
engineering of executable programs. In this paper, we focus on securing binary
distribution, where attackers gain access to binaries distributed to end
devices, in order to reverse engineer them and find potential vulnerabilities.
Attackers do not however have means to monitor the execution of said devices.
In particular, we focus on the control flow obfuscation --- a technique that
prevents an attacker from restoring the correct reachability conditions for the
basic blocks of a program. By doing so, we thwart attackers in their effort to
infer the inputs that cause the program to enter a vulnerable state (e.g.,
buffer overrun). We propose a compiler extension for obfuscation and a minimal
hardware modification for dynamic deobfuscation that takes advantage of a
secret key stored in hardware. We evaluate our experiments on the LLVM compiler
toolchain and the BRISC-V open source processor. On PARSEC benchmarks, our
deobfuscation technique incurs only a 5\% runtime overhead. We evaluate the
security of Drndalo by training classifiers on pairs of obfuscated and
unobfuscated binaries. Our results shine light on the difficulty of producing
obfuscated binaries of arbitrary programs in such a way that they are
statistically indistinguishable from plain binaries.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Although state-of-the-art PDF malware classifiers can be trained with almost
perfect test accuracy (99%) and extremely low false positive rate (under 0.1%),
it has been shown that even a simple adversary can evade them. A practically
useful malware classifier must be robust against evasion attacks. However,
achieving such robustness is an extremely challenging task.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we take the first steps towards training robust PDF malware
classifiers with verifiable robustness properties. For instance, a robustness
property can enforce that no matter how many pages from benign documents are
inserted into a PDF malware, the classifier must still classify it as
malicious. We demonstrate how the worst-case behavior of a malware classifier
with respect to specific robustness properties can be formally verified.
Furthermore, we find that training classifiers that satisfy formally verified
robustness properties can increase the evasion cost of unbounded (i.e., not
bounded by the robustness properties) attackers by eliminating simple evasion
attacks.
</p>
<p>Specifically, we propose a new distance metric that operates on the PDF tree
structure and specify two classes of robustness properties including subtree
insertions and deletions. We utilize state-of-the-art verifiably robust
training method to build robust PDF malware classifiers. Our results show that,
we can achieve 92.27% average verified robust accuracy over three properties,
while maintaining 99.74% accuracy and 0.56% false positive rate. With simple
robustness properties, our robust model maintains 7% higher robust accuracy
than all the baseline models against unrestricted whitebox attacks. Moreover,
the state-of-the-art and new adaptive evolutionary attackers need up to 10
times larger $L_0$ feature distance and 21 times more PDF basic mutations
(e.g., inserting and deleting objects) to evade our robust model than the
baselines.

<p>With the great success of graph embedding model on both academic and industry
area, the robustness of graph embedding against adversarial attack inevitably
becomes a central problem in graph learning domain. Regardless of the fruitful
progress, most of the current works perform the attack in a white-box fashion:
they need to access the model predictions and labels to construct their
adversarial loss. However, the inaccessibility of model predictions in real
systems makes the white-box attack impractical to real graph learning system.
This paper promotes current frameworks in a more general and flexible sense --
we demand to attack various kinds of graph embedding model with black-box
driven. To this end, we begin by investigating the theoretical connections
between graph signal processing and graph embedding models in a principled way
and formulate the graph embedding model as a general graph signal process with
corresponding graph filter. As such, a generalized adversarial attacker:
GF-Attack is constructed by the graph filter and feature matrix. Instead of
accessing any knowledge of the target classifiers used in graph embedding,
GF-Attack performs the attack only on the graph filter in a black-box attack
fashion. To validate the generalization of GF-Attack, we construct the attacker
on four popular graph embedding models. Extensive experimental results validate
the effectiveness of our attacker on several benchmark datasets. Particularly
by using our attack, even small graph perturbations like one-edge flip is able
to consistently make a strong attack in performance to different graph
embedding models.

<p>Differential Power Analysis (DPA) has been an active area of research for the
past two decades to study the attacks for extracting secret information from
cryptographic implementations through power measurements and their defenses.
Unfortunately, the research on power side-channels have so far predominantly
focused on analyzing implementations of ciphers such as AES, DES, RSA, and
recently post-quantum cryptography primitives (e.g., lattices). Meanwhile,
machine-learning, and in particular deep-learning applications are becoming
ubiquitous with several scenarios where the Machine Learning Models are
Intellectual Properties requiring confidentiality. Expanding side-channel
analysis to Machine Learning Model extraction, however, is largely unexplored.
</p>
<p>This paper expands the DPA framework to neural-network classifiers. First, it
shows DPA attacks during inference to extract the secret model parameters such
as weights and biases of a neural network. Second, it proposes the
$\textit{first countermeasures}$ against these attacks by augmenting
$\textit{masking}$. The resulting design uses novel masked components such as
masked adder trees for fully-connected layers and masked Rectifier Linear Units
for activation functions. On a SAKURA-X FPGA board, experiments show that the
first-order DPA attacks on the unprotected implementation can succeed with only
200 traces and our protection respectively increases the latency and area-cost
by 2.8x and 2.3x.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>It is challenging to convert a hazy color image into a gray-scale image because the color contrast field of a hazy image is distorted. In this paper, a novel decolorization algorithm is proposed to transfer a hazy image into a distortion-recovered gray-scale image. To recover the color contrast field, the relationship between the restored color contrast and its distorted input is presented in CIELab color space. Based on this restoration, a nonlinear optimization problem is formulated to construct the resultant gray-scale image. A new differentiable approximation solution is introduced to solve this problem with an extension of the Huber loss function. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm effectively preserves the global luminance consistency while represents the original color contrast in gray-scales, which is very close to the corresponding ground truth gray-scale one.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Light field (LF) stitching is a potential solution to improve the field of view (FOV) for hand-held plenoptic cameras. Existing LF stitching methods cannot provide accurate registration for scenes with large depth variation. In this paper, a novel LF stitching method is proposed to handle parallax in the LFs more flexibly and accurately. First, a depth layer map (DLM) is proposed to guarantee adequate feature points on each depth layer. For the regions of nondeterministic depth, superpixel layer map (SLM) is proposed based on LF spatial correlation analysis to refine the depth layer assignments. Then, DLM-SLM-based LF registration is proposed to derive the location dependent homography transforms accurately and to warp LFs to its corresponding position without parallax interference. 4D graph-cut is further applied to fuse the registration results for higher LF spatial continuity and angular continuity. Horizontal, vertical and multi-LF stitching are tested for different scenes, which demonstrates the superior performance provided by the proposed method in terms of subjective quality of the stitched LFs, epipolar plane image consistency in the stitched LF, and perspective-averaged correlation between the stitched LF and the input LFs.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a two-layer adaptive differential evolution (ADE) algorithm is adopted to monitor the parameters of the receiving resonators and the mutual inductances of series-series (SS)-compensated wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. By only measuring the primary coils' voltages and currents, the proposed monitoring method can be applied for multiple-coil SS-compensated WPT systems without any feedback signals from the receivers. Compared to the conventional monitoring method based on the genetic algorithm (GA), which may find local optimal solutions by the manually tuned parameters of the mutation rate, the crossover rate, and the generations, the proposed method based on the two-layer ADE can always find global optimal solutions by the automatically tuned parameters of the differential weight, the crossover rate, and the generations. Experimental results validate that the ADE and the proposed two-layer ADE can monitor the parameters of both two- and three-coil SS-compensated WPT systems more steadily and accurately than the conventional GA. Additionally, the proposed two-layer ADE is verified to monitor the parameters of three-coil SS-compensated WPT systems with three different arrangements more accurately than the ADE.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Identification of the stator d-axis and q-axis inductances is essential for the interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) sensorless control system. The signal injection method is an effective way to identify the inductance parameters; however, it requires the rotor position to ensure the accuracy of the injection reference position. To overcome the dependence on the rotor position, a sequence-pulse voltage signal injection method is presented. The matrix least-squares fitting algorithm is utilized to fit the current responses for the inductance identification. Based on the fitting method, the discrete standard orthogonal polynomial with look-up table is introduced to reduce the computation complexity. To reduce the disturbance of the injected signal to the rotor position during the identification process, a double-direction injection position trajectory planning is presented. In addition, the saturation effect on the identification method is also analyzed. The proposed method is verified via a 3.0 kW IPMSM motor drive platform. The identification results are compared with those measured by a standard method and experiment results show that the proposed method can identify the inductance parameters with acceptable accuracy without obtaining the rotor position information.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The accuracy of power electronics simulation relies on the semiconductor switch model employed. Thus, in this paper where an ultrafast mechatronic circuit breaker (UFMCB) is implemented in real-time on the field programmable gate array, a detailed nonlinear thyristor model is proposed for extra device-level information regarding design evaluation. The cascaded thyristors impose a heavy computational burden on the UFMCB simulation, and node elimination is achieved following the proposal of a scalable thyristor model. For the convenience of the circuit breaker's integration into dc grid, a pair of coupled voltage-current sources is inserted as its interface, which achieves a reduction in the dimension of system admittance matrix, and the subsequent proposal of a relaxed scalar Newton-Raphson method further expedites the simulation by decomposing the nodal matrix equation. Meanwhile, the modular multilevel converter as a dc grid terminal adopts half-bridge and clamped double submodule topologies to test system performance in conjunction with the UFMCB. Real-time execution is achieved and the results are validated by ANSYS/Simplorer and PSCAD/EMTDC in device- and system-level, respectively.

The proposed converter has the ZETA converter advantages, such as buck-boost capability, input-to-output dc insulation, and continuous output current. The suggested converter voltage gain is higher than the classic ZETA converter. In the presented converter, only one main switch is utilized. The proposed converter offers low voltage stress of the switch; therefore, the low on-state resistance of the main switch can be selected to decrease the losses of the switch. The presented converter topology is simple; hence, the control of the converter is simple. The converter has the continuous output current. The mathematical analyses of the presented converter are given. The experimental results confirm the correctness of the analysis.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Torque motor is one key component that directly influences the dynamic performance of jet pipe servo valve in aircraft. In this paper, a novel torque motor with hybrid-magnetization pole arrays is proposed. By changing the magnetization patterns of permanent magnets, the torque motor can significantly improve the output torque by range of 47-52% compared with traditional designs, while maintaining the system size and mass. The design concept and operating principle of the torque motor is presented. The magnetic field distribution is formulated analytically with equivalent magnetic circuit. Different from conventional study, the flux leakage of the permanent magnets and coils is included to improve the model precision. Subsequently, the output torque is derived mathematically from the airgap flux. Following that, the numerical calculation is conducted to validate the mathematical models of magnetic field and output torque. The design optimization is then carried out. One research prototype that can be mounted with either conventional magnet or the proposed hybrid array has been developed. The test rigs are constructed and experiments are conducted on the prototype. Both numerical computation and experimental results verify the significant improvement of torque generation of the proposed hybrid magnetization torque motor.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent development of object detection mainly depends on deep learning with large-scale benchmarks. However, collecting such fully-annotated data is often difficult or expensive for real-world applications, which restricts the power of deep neural networks in practice. Alternatively, humans can detect new objects with little annotation burden, since humans often use the prior knowledge to identify new objects with few elaborately-annotated examples, and subsequently generalize this capacity by exploiting objects from wild images. Inspired by this procedure of learning to detect, we propose a novel Progressive Object Transfer Detection (POTD) framework. Specifically, we make three main contributions in this paper. First, POTD can leverage various object supervision of different domains effectively into a progressive detection procedure. Via such human-like learning, one can boost a target detection task with few annotations. Second, POTD consists of two delicate transfer stages, i.e., Low-Shot Transfer Detection (LSTD), and Weakly-Supervised Transfer Detection (WSTD). In LSTD, we distill the implicit object knowledge of source detector to enhance target detector with few annotations. It can effectively warm up WSTD later on. In WSTD, we design a recurrent object labelling mechanism for learning to annotate weakly-labeled images. More importantly, we exploit the reliable object supervision from LSTD, which can further enhance the robustness of target detector in the WSTD stage. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on a number of challenging detection benchmarks with different settings. The results demonstrate that, our POTD outperforms the recent state-of-the-art approaches. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/Cassie94/LSTD/tree/lstd.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to the existence of various anomalies such as non-Gaussian process and measurement noises, gross measurement errors, and sudden changes of system status, the robust forecasting-aided state estimation is pivotal for power system stability. This paper develops a novel unscented Kalman filter (UKF) with the generalized correntropy loss (GCL) (termed as GCL-UKF) to estimate power system state with forecasting aid. The GCL is used to replace the mean square error loss in the original UKF framework. The advantage of such an approach is that it combines the strength of the GCL developed in robust information theoretic learning for addressing the non-Gaussian interference and the strength of the UKF in handling strong model nonlinearities. In addition, we take into account the nontrivial influences of the bad data for the innovation vector. An enhanced GCL-UKF method is established by introducing an exponential function of the innovation vector to adjust a covariance matrix so as to improve the GCL-UKF-based state estimation accuracy under the change of gain matrix caused by bad factors. Numerical simulation results carried out on IEEE 14-bus, 30-bus, and 57-bus test systems validate the efficacy of the proposed methods for state estimation under various types of measurement.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The advancement of digital holography in the past two decades has enabled precise capturing of three-dimensional (3-D) images of physical objects. This important technology has been widely applied in numerous industrial sectors such as, but not limited to remote sensing, metrology, biomedical imaging, advertising, and entertainment. Most of the hologram acquisition techniques developed to date is employing digital cameras for recording the hologram, hence imposing rigid restrictions on the size and resolution of the captured 3-D image. This limitation, however, is not found in optical scanning holography (OSH). Based on a scanning mechanism and a single pixel sensor, OSH is capable of capturing digital holograms of both macroscopic and microscopic, as well as fluorescent objects with high precision. Since its invention in the late 70s, numerous research works have been conducted to enhance this technology, optimizing important factors such as acquisition speed, precision, data size, and security. The objective of this article is to provide a walkthrough of the state-of-the-art of the OSH technology, from its original principle, to different variants that have been developed over the years with emphasis on their feature extraction capabilities under the incoherent mode of operation. Whenever possible, we shall provide the key formulations of each approach, and experimental outcomes for demonstrating the pros and cons of the method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Digital holographic imaging is a powerful technique that can provide wavefront information of a three-dimensional object for biological and industrial applications. However, due to the constraint and cost of imaging sensors, the acquired digital hologram is limited in terms of pixel count, thus affecting the resolution in holographic reconstruction. To overcome this constraint, in this paper we propose a deep learning-based method to super-resolve holograms and to improve the quality of low-resolution holograms by training a convolutional neural network with large-scale data for resolution enhancement. Moreover, this algorithm can be broadly adapted to enhance the space-bandwidth product of a holographic imaging system without the need of any advanced hardware. We experimentally validate its capability using a lens-free off-axis holographic system, and compare the performance of various loss functions and interpolation methods in training such a network.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a new robust field-weakening approach for reluctance synchronous motors regulated by direct torque and flux control. Compared to the existing direct torque and flux control based field-weakening methods that cannot achieve maximized DC-link voltage utilization and are parameter dependent, the proposed approach contributes to improve the field-weakening performance of reluctance synchronous motor in two aspects. First, it extends the constant power speed range through autonomous stator flux reference adjustment, which maximizes the dc-link voltage utilization. Smooth transition between the maximum torque per ampere trajectory and field-weakening trajectory is also realized. Second, it enhances the parameter robustness of drives in very high-speed region by employing a torque reference adjustment scheme. This effectively avoids the instability of drives caused by machine parameter variations. The proposed approach is verified experimentally on a laboratory setup.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A path-following controller based on an uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE) for a quadrotor with a cable-suspended payload is proposed in this paper. The quadrotor and the payload are subject to unknown wind disturbances. The controller resembles a cascade architecture. For the outer loop, a UDE-based translational control law is proposed. The controller asymptotically stabilizes the quadrotor along a given path and estimates the lumped disturbances with a low-pass filter. For the inner loop, an attitude tracking controller is used to control the direction of the lift vector so that the actual lift force can asymptotically follow the reference force generated by the translational controller. The stability of the system with the translational controller and the attitude tracking controller has been shown to be asymptotically stable using the reduction theorem. With the help of the reduction theorem, the design of the translational and the attitude control can be decoupled, providing the flexibility of implementing different attitude controllers without redoing the stability analysis. As shown in the simulation, the control law can stabilize the quadrotor on the desired path under different wind disturbances.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Massive MIMO attains high spectral and power efficiency transmission by leveraging a large number of transmit antennas. However, to capture the benefits of massive MIMO, each antenna should be accompanied with a dedicated RF chain, and consequently, the hardware costs would scale up tremendously with the increase of the antennas. Cheap implementations of massive MIMO have recently gained considerable attention, and constant modulus (CM) signaling is seen as a promising solution, owing to its low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). This paper investigates the physical-layer (PHY) security in massive MIMO with an emphasis on the CM signaling. In particular, we consider a transmitter with massive antennas broadcast common confidential information to a group of legitimate receivers, and a number of eavesdroppers overhear the transmission and attempt to intercept the information. Our goal is to design the CM beamforming at the transmitter so that the multicast secrecy rate is maximized. This secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is generally NP-hard. To tackle it, two tractable approaches are developed. The first one employs the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique and the Charnes-Copper transformation to obtain a convex relaxation of the SRM problem. However, due to the dimension lifting of SDR, this approach is feasible only for small to medium antenna sizes. The second approach leverages the Dinkelbach method to work directly over the beamformer domain; a custom-build nonconvex alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed to efficiently perform each Dinkelbach update. Simulation results demonstrate that the second approach is computationally more efficient and can achieve nearly optimal performance when the number of antennas is large.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has recently identified digital relays as targets vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The DHS has also noted that attacks to multiple relays can bring about cascading outages of transmission lines, leading to blackouts. As a result, making protective relays cyber-resilient is a prominent security issue in power networks. Line current differential relays (LCDRs) are among the potentially vulnerable digital relays that are increasingly deployed for protecting critical transmission lines. LCDRs, however, lack the required resiliency against cyber attacks, due to their high dependence on communication systems. This paper unveils that such susceptibilities can result in unwarranted trip signals through false data injection attacks (FDIAs), and so cause instability if several attacks are coordinated. It also presents a solution for detecting FDIAs and distinguishing them from real internal faults. To detect attacks, the proposed method compares the estimated and locally measured voltages at an LCDR's terminal for both the positive sequence (PS) and negative sequence (NS). To estimate the local voltage for each sequence, the proposed technique uses an unknown input observer (UIO), the state-space model of the faulty line, and remote and local measurements, all associated with that sequence. The difference between the measured and estimated local voltages for each sequence remains close to zero during real internal faults because, in this condition, the state-space model based on which the UIO operates correctly represents the line. Nevertheless, the state-space model mismatch during FDIAs leads to a large difference between measured and estimated values in both sequences. The effectiveness of the proposed method is corroborated using simulation results for the IEEE 39-bus network.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the optimal tradeoff between secrecy and non-secrecy rates of the MISO wiretap channels for different power constraint settings: sum power constraint only, per-antenna power constraints only, and joint sum and per-antenna power constraints. The problem is motivated by the fact that channel capacity and secrecy capacity are generally achieved by different transmit strategies. First, a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure a positive secrecy capacity is shown. The optimal tradeoff between secrecy rate and transmission rate is characterized by a weighted rate sum maximization problem. Since this problem is not necessarily convex, equivalent problem formulations are introduced to derive the optimal transmit strategies. Under sum power constraint only, a closed-form solution is provided. Under per-antenna power constraints, necessary conditions to find the optimal power allocation are derived. Sufficient conditions are provided for the special case of two transmit antennas. For the special case of aligned channels, the optimal transmit strategies can deduced from an equivalent point-to-point channel problem. Last, the theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Anomaly detection is an important technique used to identify patterns of unusual network behavior and keep the network under control. Today, network attacks are increasing in terms of both their number and sophistication. To avoid causing significant traffic patterns and being detected by existing techniques, many new attacks tend to involve gradual adjustment of behaviors, which always generate incomplete sessions due to their running mechanisms. Accordingly, in this work, we employ the behavior symmetry degree to profile the anomalies and further identify unusual behaviors. We first proposed a symmetry degree to identify the incomplete sessions generated by unusual behaviors; we then employ a sketch to calculate the symmetry degree of internal hosts to improve the identification efficiency for online applications. To reduce the memory cost and probability of collision, we divide the IP addresses into four segments that can be used as keys of the hash functions in the sketch. Moreover, to further improve detection accuracy, a threshold selection method is proposed for dynamic traffic pattern analysis. The hash functions in the sketch are then designed using Chinese remainder theory, which can analytically trace the IP addresses associated with the anomalies. We tested the proposed techniques based on traffic data collected from the northwest center of CERNET (China Education and Research Network); the results show that the proposed methods can effectively detect anomalies in large-scale networks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Image restoration (IR) is a long-standing challenging problem in low-level image processing. It is of utmost importance to learn good image priors for pursuing visually pleasing results. In this paper, we develop a multi-channel and multi-model-based denoising autoencoder network as image prior for solving IR problem. Specifically, the network that trained on RGB-channel images is used to construct a prior at first, and then the learned prior is incorporated into single-channel grayscale IR tasks. To achieve the goal, we employ the auxiliary variable technique to integrate the higher-dimensional network-driven prior information into the iterative restoration procedure. In addition, according to the weighted aggregation idea, a multi-model strategy is put forward to enhance the network stability that favors to avoid getting trapped in local optima. Extensive experiments on image deblurring and deblocking tasks show that the proposed algorithm is efficient, robust, and yields state-of-the-art restoration quality on grayscale images.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel deep sparse coding network (SCN) capable of efficiently adapting its own regularization parameters for a given application. The network is trained end-to-end with a supervised task-driven learning algorithm via error backpropagation. During training, the network learns both the dictionaries and the regularization parameters of each sparse coding layer so that the reconstructive dictionaries are smoothly transformed into increasingly discriminative representations. In addition, the adaptive regularization also offers the network more flexibility to adjust sparsity levels. Furthermore, we have devised a sparse coding layer utilizing a &#x201c;skinny&#x201d; dictionary. Integral to computational efficiency, these skinny dictionaries compress the high-dimensional sparse codes into lower dimensional structures. The adaptivity and discriminability of our 15-layer SCN are demonstrated on six benchmark datasets, namely Cifar-10, Cifar-100, STL-10, SVHN, MNIST, and ImageNet, most of which are considered difficult for sparse coding models. Experimental results show that our architecture overwhelmingly outperforms traditional one-layer sparse coding architectures while using much fewer parameters. Moreover, our multilayer architecture exploits the benefits of depth with sparse coding's characteristic ability to operate on smaller datasets. In such data-constrained scenarios, our technique demonstrates a highly competitive performance compared with the deep neural networks.
