<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Because of the dynamic nature of network traffic patterns, such as new traffic application arrivals or flash events, it is becoming increasingly difficult for conventional anomaly detection systems to separate various applications based on their traffic patterns. In this paper, by leveraging transport layer packet-level and flow-level features, new structures called application fingerprints are generated, which express such features in a compact and efficient manner. Based on the generated fingerprints, we propose a novel traffic classification framework. The proposed system generates profiles of normal applications using a multi-modal probability distribution. The proposed classification framework is then extended to detect distributed denial of service attacks from the collected statistical information at flow level. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system, we evaluate its performance using five real-world traffic datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method is capable of achieving an accuracy of over 97%, whereas the misclassification rate is only 2.5%.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we examine the physical layer security of a cooperative relay network where two source-destination pairs communicate through a decode-and-forward (DF) relay in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. To safeguard the legitimate communications against eavesdropping, we propose a novel two-stage secure relay selection (TSSRS) with a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme to maximize the capacity of one source-destination pair, while guaranteeing the successful communication of the other source-destination pair. To explicitly reveal the benefits of our proposed scheme, we derive the exact and asymptotic expressions for its secrecy outage probability. As a benchmark, we also analyze the secrecy performance of the TSSRS strategy with an orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that our proposed TSSRS-NOMA scheme significantly outperforms the TSSRS-OMA scheme when the transmit power at the source and relay is in the low and medium regimes. In addition, we show that the advantage of the TSSRS-NOMA scheme over the TSSRS-OMA scheme becomes obvious when the two source-destination pairs have profoundly different secrecy requirements.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Facial expression recognition in the wild is challenging due to various unconstrained conditions. Although existing facial expression classifiers have been almost perfect on analyzing constrained frontal faces, they fail to perform well on partially occluded faces that are common in the wild. In this paper, we propose a convolution neutral network (CNN) with attention mechanism (ACNN) that can perceive the occlusion regions of the face and focus on the most discriminative un-occluded regions. ACNN is an end-to-end learning framework. It combines the multiple representations from facial regions of interest (ROIs). Each representation is weighed via a proposed gate unit that computes an adaptive weight from the region itself according to the unobstructedness and importance. Considering different RoIs, we introduce two versions of ACNN: patch-based ACNN (pACNN) and global-local-based ACNN (gACNN). pACNN only pays attention to local facial patches. gACNN integrates local representations at patch-level with global representation at image-level. The proposed ACNNs are evaluated on both real and synthetic occlusions, including a self-collected facial expression dataset with real-world occlusions, the two largest in-the-wild facial expression datasets (RAF-DB and AffectNet) and their modifications with synthesized facial occlusions. Experimental results show that ACNNs improve the recognition accuracy on both the non-occluded faces and occluded faces. Visualization results demonstrate that, compared with the CNN without Gate Unit, ACNNs are capable of shifting the attention from the occluded patches to other related but unobstructed ones. ACNNs also outperform other state-of-the-art methods on several widely used in-the-lab facial expression datasets under the cross-dataset evaluation protocol.

<p>The existing malware analysis platforms leave detectable fingerprints such as uncommon string properties in QEMU, signatures in Android Java virtual machine, and artifacts in Linux kernel profiles. Since these fingerprints provide the malware a chance to split its behavior depending on whether the analysis system is present or not, the existing analysis systems are not sufficient to analyze the sophisticated malware. In this paper, we propose NINJA, a transparent malware analysis framework on the ARM platform with low artifacts. NINJA leverages a hardware-assisted isolated execution environment TrustZone to transparently trace and debug a target application with the help of performance monitor unit and embedded trace macrocell. These hardware features help NINJA to achieve transparency while avoiding heavy performance overhead. NINJA does not modify system software and is OS-agnostic on the ARM platform. We implement a prototype of NINJA (i.e., tracing and debugging subsystems), and the experimental results show that NINJA is efficient and transparent for malware analysis. An improved fast system restoration mechanism is also designed to facilitate the continuous malware analysis.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The cloud-enabled Internet of controlled things (IoCT) envisions a network of sensors, controllers, and actuators connected through a local cloud in order to intelligently control physical devices. Because cloud services are vulnerable to advanced persistent threats (APTs), each device in the IoCT must strategically decide whether to trust cloud services that may be compromised. In this paper, we present iSTRICT, an interdependent strategic trust mechanism for the cloud-enabled IoCT. iSTRICT is composed of three interdependent layers. In the cloud layer, iSTRICT uses FlipIt games to conceptualize APTs. In the communication layer, it captures the interaction between devices and the cloud using signaling games. In the physical layer, iSTRICT uses optimal control to quantify the utilities in the higher level games. Best response dynamics link the three layers in an overall &#x201c;game-of-games,&#x201d; for which the outcome is captured by a concept called Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE). We prove the existence of a GNE under a set of natural assumptions and develop an adaptive algorithm to iteratively compute the equilibrium. Finally, we apply iSTRICT to trust management for autonomous vehicles that rely on measurements from remote sources. We show that strategic trust in the communication layer achieves a worst-case probability of compromise for any attack and defense costs in the cyber layer.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel bilinear projections model for unsupervised learning, which can be directly applied to dimension reduction and feature extraction for image analysis. Compared to previous 2-dimensional (2D) methods, our method seeks multiple rank- $k$  bilinear projections (MRBP), which makes a balance between two opposite problems of enhancing the degree of freedom and avoiding the problem of over-fitting by adjusting  $k$ . Besides, each renewed feature in our method is extracted independently, rather than dimensions reduced by row or column like before, and thus our reduced dimension is not restricted by the size of a sample. In addition, we demonstrate that our model could be optimized via two equivalent optimization problems based on the criteria of maximum separability and nearest reconstruction respectively. Motivated by this, the corresponding robust version (RMRBP) achieving a better performance to occluded data is introduced as well. Extensive experiments on several datasets have been done to verify the effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies are gaining momentum for Internet-of-things applications since they promise wide coverage to a massive number of battery operated devices using grant-free medium access. LoRaWAN, with its physical (PHY) layer design and regulatory efforts, has emerged as the widely adopted LPWAN solution. By using chirp spread spectrum modulation with qausi-orthogonal spreading factors (SFs), LoRa PHY offers coverage to wide-area applications while supporting high-density of devices. However, thus far its scalability performance has been inadequately modeled and the effect of interference resulting from the imperfect orthogonality of the SFs has not been considered. In this paper, we present an analytical model of a single-cell LoRa system that accounts for the impact of interference among transmissions over the same SF (co-SF) as well as different SFs (inter-SF). By modeling the interference field as Poisson point process under duty cycled ALOHA, we derive the signal-to-interference ratio distributions for several interference conditions. Results show that, for a duty cycle as low as 0.33&#x0025;, the network performance under co-SF interference alone is considerably optimistic as the inclusion of inter-SF interference unveils a further drop in the success probability and the coverage probability of approximately 10&#x0025; and 15&#x0025;, respectively, for 1500 devices in a LoRa channel. Finally, we illustrate how our analysis can characterize the critical device density with respect to cell size for a given reliability target.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a centimeter-grade metropolitan positioning (CGMP) framework for achieving lane-level localization through Internet of Vehicles (IoV) communications. The CGMP framework integrates vehicle-to-roadside (V2R) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications with installed roadside/intersection cameras to provide positioning information to vehicles on the road. This framework can be used to estimate the precise position of a vehicle and detect the lane of each vehicle. The estimated positions and detected lanes can be broadcast to nearby vehicles through V2R and V2V communications. According to our review of relevant research, CGMP is the first positioning system to provide the following features: centimeter-grade positioning accuracy through IoV communications that can detect a vehicle&#x0027;s current lane; the employment of existing roadside/intersection cameras, thus keeping additional construction costs low; and an innovative infrastructure for the application of next-generation intelligent transportation systems that can enable lane-level traffic control, collision avoidance, and vehicle navigation. A prototype based on wireless access in vehicular environments/dedicated short-range communications is implemented to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework. The experimental results indicate that fully deployed CGMP can achieve centimeter-grade positioning accuracy with the error around 10 cm, and partially deployed CGMP can significantly reduce the positioning errors of existing localization methods.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents the framework of a power-dispatching automation system (PDAS) based on a virtual private cloud, which extracts advantages of technologies, such as a virtual private cloud, a virtual private network, an https protocol, etc. Unlike existing on-premise or public cloud hosted PDASs that are vulnerable and may be subject to blackouts due to extreme conditions, such as natural disasters or cyberattacks, the proposed framework operates more safely and securely under those conditions, while at the same time meeting the reliability requirements for power systems as well. This paper presents the theory, architectural design, characteristics, and implementation process of the system, as well as its reliability and cyber security measurements. The annual failure time of the proposed system is reduced from 61.2 to about 0.43 min, about 142 times less than those of existing PDASs. This framework has been implemented in the Lipu power system in China since May 2016. Results show that the proposed system is reliable, safe, and cost-effective, with a bright prospect for future applications.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The real-time electricity consumption data can be used in value-added service such as big data analysis, meanwhile the single user&#x0027;s privacy needs to be protected. How to balance the data utility and the privacy preservation is a vital issue, where the privacy-preserving data aggregation could be a feasible solution. Most of the existing data aggregation schemes rely on a trusted third party (TTP). However, this assumption will have negative impact on reliability, because the system can be easily knocked down by the denial of service attack. In this paper, a practical privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme is proposed without TTP, in which the users with some extent trust construct a virtual aggregation area to mask the single user&#x0027;s data, and meanwhile, the aggregation result almost has no effect for the data utility in large scale applications. The computation cost and communication overhead are reduced in order to promote the practicability. Moreover, the security analysis and the performance evaluation show that the proposed scheme is robust and efficient.

<p><span class="paragraphSection">Over the past decade, nutritional psychiatry has developed into a promising research area in a field with great unmet need. The early research has advanced from cross-sectional epidemiological studies reporting associations between diet quality and mental health outcomes, including depression and anxiety, to longitudinal and mechanistic studies. Observational findings have been extensively replicated and documented in meta-analyses and are supported by intervention studies examining the efficacy of dietary improvement as a treatment for depression; recently, 2 preliminary trials of dietary interventions for depression have yielded similar positive findings. A new meta-analysis confirms that dietary interventions significantly reduce depressive symptoms, although nearly all studies to date have involved nonclinically depressed populations; that is, individuals with subsyndromal depressive symptoms, metabolic disorders, other somatic conditions, or healthy adults recruited from the general population. Thus, for the findings from these studies to serve as catalysts for clinical change, additional independent and methodologically rigorous interventions targeting depression are essential. In this issue of <span style="font-style: italic;">JAMA</span>, 2 randomized trials provide important results that focus on the emerging field of nutritional psychiatry.</span>

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The interleaved bidirectional buck&#x2013;boost converter dual active half-bridge (IBBC-DAHB) dc&#x2013;dc converter consists of two converters IBBC and DAHB and a coupled inductor. The IBBC-DAHB converter has significant features such as low ripple current at the low-voltage side, low current stress on the input inductors, voltage stress across the switches less than the high-voltage side, high voltage gain, and zero-voltage soft switching. The converter offers high efficiency using phase-shift modulation when it operates at a nominal design operating point. However, the efficiency decreases due to high circulating current, high current stress, and limited soft-switching range when the source and load voltages deviate from their nominal values. This paper employs both duty cycle and phase-shift modulation methods to improve the above mentioned shortcomings using voltage matching for the DAHB converter. The proposed converter is analyzed and a 500-W experimental prototype with 40&#x2013;60 V input voltage and 400 V output voltage under 100 kHz switching frequency is implemented to verify the theoretical results. The maximum efficiency of 97.15&#x0025; is achieved at 60&#x00a0;V and 400&#x00a0;W. A flat efficiency characteristic for the converter is derived by the proposed control method, where the efficiency at 20&#x0025; of nominal load is 91&#x0025; and much higher than the phase-shift control, which is 70.8&#x0025;.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this work, the design of a novel the flexure-linked dual-drive H-gantry is first introduced. Compared to conventional stacked X&#x2013;Y tables, the advantages of this gantry are on decoupled X&#x2013;Y actuation, better mechanical reliability, larger driving force, and shorter response time. However, after deriving its reduced-order dynamical model, it is found that the precision of the end-effector is significantly affected by the position dependent torque caused by the inter-parallel-axes driving forces on the fixed inertia frame and coupling forces from the pair of flexures. These form barriers that limit precision positioning and tracking performance over a large workspace. Thus, in the following part, a robust integral of signum of error (RISE) control with novel jerk adaptation is proposed on top of the standard proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and feedforward scheme. Compared with some prior RISE schemes with gain adaptation, the proposed scheme yields bounded robust gain in the presence of noisy velocity estimation. Real-time experiments on the actual testbed indicate that both improvement of motion precision and prevention of resonant mode excitation over a large workspace are successfully achieved in the proposed scheme.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Despite the recent advances on intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings, existing research works mostly assume training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution. However, due to variation of operating condition, domain shift phenomenon generally exists, which results in significant diagnosis performance deterioration. To address cross-domain problems, latest research works preferably apply domain adaptation techniques on marginal data distributions. However, it is usually assumed that sufficient testing data are available for training, that is not in accordance with most transfer tasks in real industries where only data in machine healthy condition can be collected in advance. This paper proposes a novel cross-domain fault diagnosis method based on deep generative neural networks. By artificially generating fake samples for domain adaptation, the proposed method is able to provide reliable cross-domain diagnosis results when testing data in machine fault conditions are not available for training. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method offers a promising approach for industrial applications.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>AC cascaded system is one of the basic components of the power conversion system in the modern more-electric aircraft (MEA). However, the ac cascaded system suffers from an instability problem, i.e., even if each subsystem is stable individually, the formed cascaded system may become unstable. Most of the existing stabilization methods are a linear control method, which is based on a small signal model and can only ensure small signal stability near the operation point in theory. Therefore, these existing linear stabilization methods may be ineffective to fix large-signal stability issues. In this paper, a large signal stability constraining dichotomy solution (SCDS)-based model predictive control (MPC) is proposed to improve the stability of the ac cascaded system in the MEA by the Lyapunov criteria. This approach first theoretically presents how to add the system stability item to the MPC cost function in an analytic way instead of using the traditional &#x201c;experience-based&#x201d; weight method. Besides, the SCDS-MPC itself is also an improvement to the existing finite control set MPC. It can realize a constant switching frequency and achieve better steady-state&#x002f;dynamic current control performance. Finally, a 1.5 kW ac cascaded system is fabricated in the laboratory to verify the proposed SCDS-MPC method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fractional interpolation is used to provide sub-pixel level references for motion compensation in the interprediction of video coding, which attempts to remove temporal redundancy in video sequences. Traditional handcrafted fractional interpolation filters face the challenge of modeling discontinuous regions in videos, while existing deep learning-based methods are either designed for a single quantization parameter (QP), only generating half-pixel samples, or need to train a model for each sub-pixel position. In this paper, we present a one-for-all fractional interpolation method based on a grouped variation convolutional neural network (GVCNN). Our method can deal with video frames coded using different QPs and is capable of generating all sub-pixel positions at one sub-pixel level. Also, by predicting variations between integer-position pixels and sub-pixels, our network offers more expressive power. Moreover, we perform specific measurements in training data generation to simulate practical situations in video coding, including blurring the down-sampled sub-pixel samples to avoid aliasing effects and coding integer pixels to simulate reconstruction errors. In addition, we analyze the impact of the size of blur kernels theoretically. Experimental results verify the efficiency of GVCNN. Compared with HEVC, our method achieves 2.2% in bit saving on average and up to 5.2% under low-delay P configuration.

We propose an enhanced PeerHunter, a network-flow level community behavior analysis based system, to detect P2P botnets. Our system starts from a P2P network flow detection component. Then, it uses &#x201c;mutual contacts&#x201d; to cluster bots into communities. Finally, it uses network-flow level community behavior analysis to detect potential botnets. In the experimental evaluation, we propose two evasion attacks, where we assume the adversaries know our techniques in advance and attempt to evade our system by making the P2P bots mimic the behavior of legitimate P2P applications. Our results showed that enhanced PeerHunter can obtain high detection rate with few false positives, and high robustness against the proposed attacks.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Using multi-atlas registration (MAR), information carried by atlases can be transferred onto a new input image for the tasks of region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation, anatomical landmark detection, and so on. Conventional atlases used in MAR methods are monomodal and contain only normal anatomical structures. Therefore, the majority of MAR methods cannot handle input multimodal pathological images, which are often collected in routine image-based diagnosis. This is because registering monomodal atlases with normal appearances to multimodal pathological images involves two major problems: 1) missing imaging modalities in the monomodal atlases and 2) influence from pathological regions. In this paper, we propose a new MAR framework to tackle these problems. In this framework, deep learning-based image synthesizers are applied for synthesizing multimodal normal atlases from conventional monomodal normal atlases. To reduce the influence from pathological regions, we further propose a multimodal low-rank approach to recover multimodal normal-looking images from multimodal pathological images. Finally, the multimodal normal atlases can be registered to the recovered multimodal images in a multi-channel way. We evaluate our MAR framework via brain ROI segmentation of multimodal tumor brain images. Due to the utilization of multimodal information and the reduced influence from pathological regions, experimental results show that registration based on our method is more accurate and robust, leading to significantly improved brain ROI segmentation compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Stereoscopic saliency detection plays an important role in various stereoscopic video processing applications. However, conventional stereoscopic video saliency detection methods mainly use independent low-level features instead of extracting them automatically, and thus, they ignore the intrinsic relationship between the spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel stereoscopic video saliency detection method based on 3D convolutional neural networks, namely, deep 3D video saliency (Deep3DSaliency). The proposed network consists of two sub-models: spatiotemporal saliency model (STSM) and stereoscopic saliency aware model (SSAM). STSM directly takes three consecutive video frames as the input to extract visual spatiotemporal features, while SSAM attempts to further infer the depth and semantic features from the left and right video frames by shared parameters from STSM. The visual spatiotemporal features from STSM and the depth and semantic features from SSAM are learned by an alternating optimization scheme. Finally, all these saliency-related features are combined together for the final stereoscopic saliency detection via 3D deconvolution. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed model over other existing ones in saliency estimation for 3D video sequences.
