<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Offshore ac fault protection of wind turbines (WTs) connecting with diode rectifier unit-based high-voltage dc (DRU-HVdc) system is investigated in this paper. A voltage-error-dependent fault current injection is proposed to regulate the WT current during offshore ac fault transients and quickly provide fault current for fault detection. Considering different fault locations, the fault characteristics during symmetrical and asymmetrical faults are presented and the requirements for fault detection are addressed. A simple and effective offshore ac fault protection solution, combining both overcurrent protection and differential protection, is proposed by utilizing the developed fast fault current providing control. To improve system availability, reduced dc voltage of the DRU-HVdc system is investigated, where one of the series-connected DRUs is disconnected and the onshore modular multilevel converter actively reduces dc voltage to resume wind power transmission. The proposed scheme is robust to various offshore ac faults and can automatically restore normal operation. Simulation results confirm the proposed fault protection strategy.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this work, the design of a novel the flexure-linked dual-drive H-gantry is first introduced. Compared to conventional stacked X&#x2013;Y tables, the advantages of this gantry are on decoupled X&#x2013;Y actuation, better mechanical reliability, larger driving force, and shorter response time. However, after deriving its reduced-order dynamical model, it is found that the precision of the end-effector is significantly affected by the position dependent torque caused by the inter-parallel-axes driving forces on the fixed inertia frame and coupling forces from the pair of flexures. These form barriers that limit precision positioning and tracking performance over a large workspace. Thus, in the following part, a robust integral of signum of error (RISE) control with novel jerk adaptation is proposed on top of the standard proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and feedforward scheme. Compared with some prior RISE schemes with gain adaptation, the proposed scheme yields bounded robust gain in the presence of noisy velocity estimation. Real-time experiments on the actual testbed indicate that both improvement of motion precision and prevention of resonant mode excitation over a large workspace are successfully achieved in the proposed scheme.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel finite-memory (FM) estimation method for vehicle roll and road bank angles. We consider a three-degree-of-freedom model based on bicycle and vehicle roll models, where there exist uncertainties in the model parameters. The existing estimation methods may show poor performance for the considered model with uncertainties. The accumulated errors, which might be caused by modeling uncertainties and numerical errors, may degrade the performance of existing methods because they use all past measurements. To overcome the weaknesses of the existing methods, a new FM estimation method is proposed and can prevent accumulated errors by using recent finite measurements. Both the simulation and experimental results show that the proposed estimation method ensures more reliable and accurate performance than the existing methods under various driving conditions.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A City of Hope scientist and his colleagues have developed a user-friendly approach to creating 'theranostics' -- therapy combined with diagnostics -- that target specific tumors and diseases. City of Hope's John Termini, Ph.D., and his colleagues at the California Institute of Technology and the Israel Institute of Technology developed a novel method to prepare cell-penetrating nanoparticles called 'metallocorrole/protein nanoparticles.' The theranostics could both survive longer in the body and better snipe disease targets.

<p>Freeing thousands of microorganisms to swim in random directions in an infinite pool of liquid may not sound like a recipe for order, but eventually the swarm will go with its own flow. Theoretical modeling led by University of Wisconsin-Madison applied mathematician Saverio Spagnolie shows that the forces generated by different kinds of tiny swimmers will sweep them all up in predictable ways.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p><span class="paragraphSection">By the time surgeons complete residency or fellowship training, they must be able to independently perform surgery. This can only occur if surgeons have graded responsibility, meaning that surgical residents must be able to do various parts of an operation on their own until they have mastered the skills necessary to function completely independently. One way this is done is by allowing overlapping surgery&#8212;operations in which someone other than the attending surgeon performs part of the operation. In this issue of <span style="font-style: italic;">JAMA</span>, Sun and colleagues report outcomes for overlapping surgery to show that this mechanism, which is essential for training surgical residents, is generally safe. Mortality and complications were approximately the same for operations that had substantial overlap (more than 1 hour of the procedure from the time of incision) as compared with no overlap. However, there was a signal that outcomes (mortality and complications) might be worse for high-risk patients, a scenario that makes intuitive sense. This work appealed to me because it answered an important, unresolved question: Is surgery safe as practiced in academic environments that balance the needs of safe patient care with those required to train the next generation of surgeons? The answer appears to be yes.</span>

<p><span class="paragraphSection">The modern era of medicine began in the 1960s. Health care coverage expanded with the passage of Medicare and Medicaid and the increasing availability of employee-based health insurance. Scientific and clinical advances began to occur at a far more rapid pace. Physicians became more specialized and began to focus on acute care dominated by cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer rather than infectious diseases, and there was increasing recognition of the importance of chronic diseases. With more data available, it became possible to measure variation in the delivery and quality of care, along with disparities and rationing in the provision of care. Health care costs per person more than doubled between 1960 and 1970, beginning their 5-decade increase.</span>

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fractional interpolation is used to provide sub-pixel level references for motion compensation in the interprediction of video coding, which attempts to remove temporal redundancy in video sequences. Traditional handcrafted fractional interpolation filters face the challenge of modeling discontinuous regions in videos, while existing deep learning-based methods are either designed for a single quantization parameter (QP), only generating half-pixel samples, or need to train a model for each sub-pixel position. In this paper, we present a one-for-all fractional interpolation method based on a grouped variation convolutional neural network (GVCNN). Our method can deal with video frames coded using different QPs and is capable of generating all sub-pixel positions at one sub-pixel level. Also, by predicting variations between integer-position pixels and sub-pixels, our network offers more expressive power. Moreover, we perform specific measurements in training data generation to simulate practical situations in video coding, including blurring the down-sampled sub-pixel samples to avoid aliasing effects and coding integer pixels to simulate reconstruction errors. In addition, we analyze the impact of the size of blur kernels theoretically. Experimental results verify the efficiency of GVCNN. Compared with HEVC, our method achieves 2.2% in bit saving on average and up to 5.2% under low-delay P configuration.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel screen-shooting resilient watermarking scheme, which means that if the watermarked image is displayed on the screen and the screen information is captured by the camera, we can still extract the watermark message from the captured photo. To realize such demands, we analyzed the special distortions caused by the screen-shooting process, including lens distortion, light source distortion, and moir&#x00e9; distortion. To resist the geometric deformation caused by lens distortion, we proposed an intensity-based scale-invariant feature transform (I-SIFT) algorithm which can accurately locate the embedding regions. As for the loss of image details caused by light source distortion and moir&#x00e9; distortion, we put forward a small-size template algorithm to repeatedly embed the watermark into different regions, so that at least one complete information region can survive from distortions. At the extraction side, we designed a cross-validation-based extraction algorithm to cope with repeated embedding. The validity and correctness of the extraction method are verified by hypothesis testing. Furthermore, to boost the extraction speed, we proposed a SIFT feature editing algorithm to enhance the intensity of the keypoints, based on which, the extraction accuracy and extraction speed can be greatly improved. The experimental results show that the proposed watermarking scheme achieves high robustness for screen-shooting process. Compared with the previous schemes, our algorithm provides significant improvement in robustness for screen-shooting process and extraction efficiency.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Video watermarking is a well-established technology to help identify digital pirates when they illegally re-distribute multimedia content. In order to provide every client with a unique, watermarked video, the traditional distribution architectures separately encode each watermarked video. However, since these encodings require a high amount of computational resources, such architectures do not scale well to a large number of users. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel architecture that uses fast encoders instead of traditional, full encoders. The fast encoders re-use the coding information from a single, previously-encoded, unwatermarked video in order to speed up the encodings of the watermarked videos. As a result, the complexity of a fast encoder is only a fraction of the complexity of a full encoder. Due to a high correlation of the re-used coding information with the optimal coding information, the compression efficiency and watermark robustness decrease only slightly. Most importantly, the proposed fast encoder speeds up the compression process with a factor of 115, resulting in a low complexity similar to that of a video decoder. Consequently, video distributors can use the proposed architecture to deliver high-quality watermarked videos on a large-scale without requiring an excessive amount of computational resources.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Because of the dynamic nature of network traffic patterns, such as new traffic application arrivals or flash events, it is becoming increasingly difficult for conventional anomaly detection systems to separate various applications based on their traffic patterns. In this paper, by leveraging transport layer packet-level and flow-level features, new structures called application fingerprints are generated, which express such features in a compact and efficient manner. Based on the generated fingerprints, we propose a novel traffic classification framework. The proposed system generates profiles of normal applications using a multi-modal probability distribution. The proposed classification framework is then extended to detect distributed denial of service attacks from the collected statistical information at flow level. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system, we evaluate its performance using five real-world traffic datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method is capable of achieving an accuracy of over 97&#x0025;, whereas the misclassification rate is only 2.5&#x0025;.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) botnets have become one of the major threats in network security for serving as the fundamental infrastructure for various cyber-crimes. More challenges are involved in the problem of detecting P2P botnets, despite a few work claimed to detect centralized botnets effectively. We propose an enhanced PeerHunter, a network-flow level community behavior analysis based system, to detect P2P botnets. Our system starts from a P2P network flow detection component. Then, it uses &#x201c;mutual contacts&#x201d; to cluster bots into communities. Finally, it uses network-flow level community behavior analysis to detect potential botnets. In the experimental evaluation, we propose two evasion attacks, where we assume the adversaries know our techniques in advance and attempt to evade our system by making the P2P bots mimic the behavior of legitimate P2P applications. Our results showed that enhanced PeerHunter can obtain high detection rate with few false positives, and high robustness against the proposed attacks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Despite the benefits of cyber-insurance, organizations are reluctant to enroll in such policies mainly because of their limitation and high price. On the other hand, insurers are confronting the adverse selection and moral hazard problems as monitoring and distinguishing insureds&#x2019; cybersecurity posture are highly complicated. Considering the organizations&#x2019; security interdependency and their demand for cyber-insurance, we study the design of coalitional insurance mechanisms with the goal of covering the adverse selection, moral hazard, and motivating players for cybersecurity investment and information sharing. To this end, we propose a synergistic insurance framework, where organizations collaboratively insure a common platform instead of themselves. We present three models for insuring a common platform. In the first model, organizations act as both insurer and insured to distribute the risk in the coalition. In the second model, the system provides rewards to crowdfund the insurance. Finally, in the third model, we investigate the outsourcing of a common platform insurance. Furthermore, we discuss how our proposed mechanisms for such framework satisfy the budget balanced, ex ante individual rationality, and incentive compatibility properties. We study how such a system can improve the social welfare by leveraging cyber-insurance as a motivation for organizations to cooperate on the cybersecurity investment and information sharing.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the development of data collection techniques, multi-view clustering becomes an emerging research direction to improve the clustering performance. This paper has shown that leveraging multi-view information is able to provide a rich and comprehensive description. One of the core problems is how to sufficiently represent multi-view data in the analysis. In this paper, we introduce a tensor-based representation learning method for multi-view clustering (tRLMvC) that can unify heterogeneous and high-dimensional multi-view feature spaces to a low-dimensional shared latent feature space and improve multi-view clustering performance. To sufficiently capture plenty multi-view information, the tRLMvC represents multi-view data as a third-order tensor, expresses each tensorial data point as a sparse  $t$ -linear combination of all data points with  $t$ -product, and constructs a self-expressive tensor through reconstruction coefficients. The low-dimensional multi-view data representation in the shared latent feature space can be obtained via Tucker decomposition on the self-expressive tensor. These two parts are iteratively performed so that the interaction between self-expressive tensor learning and its factorization can be enhanced and the new representation can be effectively generated for clustering purpose. We conduct extensive experiments on eight multi-view data sets and compare the proposed model with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results have shown that tRLMvC outperforms the baselines in terms of various evaluation metrics.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) is changing the way modern information systems that are designed, operated, and evolved. SOC makes possible to aggregate distributed resources at the phases of decision-making support and system operations. When myriads of resources with similar functionalities are available, effective methodologies are demanded to select services and compose them as service workflows for the specified goals. The computation for workflow composition is very complex since it depends on the numbers of services and their dynamic characteristics. Therefore, composing optimized workflows in a timely manner poses a great challenge. We are highly motivated to reduce the complexity of service selection and composition. The formalized semantics in SWSpec is extended so that unqualified or inferior services can be eliminated directly from the scope of the design solution space. In this paper, a brief review of the proposed SWSpec language is given and the focus is on the sematic formalization. A new compositional proof-system is developed with a set of inference rules and the proven system properties. The proposed semantic formalization has its great significance in reducing the complexity of composing workflows and developing efficient algorithms for compliance checking.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Safety-critical systems implemented on multicore platforms need to satisfy stringent power dissipation constraints such as thermal design power (TDP) thresholds used by chip manufacturers. Power dissipation beyond TDP may trigger dynamic thermal management (DTM) in order to ensure thermal stability of the system. However, the application of DTM makes the system susceptible to higher unpredictability and performance degradations for real-time tasks. This paper proposes a formal scheduler synthesis framework that guarantees adherence to a system level peak power constraint while allowing optimal resource utilization in multicores. Our proposed framework makes use of supervisory control of timed discrete event systems as the underlying formalism. All steps starting from individual models to construction of the scheduler have been implemented through binary decision diagram based symbolic computation, so that the state-space complexity associated with the framework may be controlled. Furthermore, the synthesis framework has been extended to handle tasks with phased execution behavior. Conducted experiments have shown promising results and indicate to the practical efficacy of our approach.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Uncertainty management is a challenging task in decision making of the operators of the power systems. Prediction of the system state is vital for the operation of a system with stochastic behavior especially in a power system with a significant amount of renewable energies such as wind power. Predictable power systems are in more interest of operators, of course. This paper proposes a multiobjective framework for optimal placement and parameters setting of a unified power flow controller (UPFC) considering system predictability. The well-known multiobjective nondominated sorting genetic algorithm is implemented to handle various objective functions such as active power losses and predictability of system in the presence of operational constraints and uncertainties. The point estimate method is used for modeling probabilistic nature of the wind power. Using the proposed method, statistical information of voltage magnitude and apparent power of converters of UPFCs can be obtained, which are very useful in making decision on the sizing of UPFCs. Comprehensive discussions are provided using the simulations on the IEEE 57-bus test system. Also, in order to validate the obtained results, a multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm is implemented and the results of two algorithms are compared with each other.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation is a technique that is being used increasingly in the development and test of complex systems. Real-world testing of an intricate system in a field-like power plant can be challenging, time-consuming, expensive, and hazardous. HIL emulators allow engineers to test devices thoroughly and efficiently in a virtual environment with high reliability and minimum risk of defect. In this paper, the complete electric power system (including generator, turbine-governor, excitation system, transmission lines, transformer, external grid and related loads) is implemented in a MATLAB&#x002f;Simulink environment. Different virtual instrument pages are modeled in the graphical programming language of LabVIEW which enable fast and reliable measurement functions such as data acquisition, archiving, real-time graphical display and processing. The interaction between MATLAB and LabVIEW is accomplished by generating a Pharlap ETS Targets <sup>&#x002a;</sup>.dll file which enables the two software to exchange real-time data. Also, a real 1518-kW excitation system is considered as a test case for the introduced HIL system. This equipment is connected to LabVIEW software through a National Instrument PXI technology. Different scenarios (electrical frequency&#x002f;active power change, voltage step response, etc.) are simulated in the designed power system emulator (PSE). The validity of the implemented model for the excitation system is verified by finding good matching between MATLAB and HIL simulation results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are considered as a promising solution in intravehicle networking to reduce wiring and production costs. This application requires reliable and real-time data delivery, while the network is very dense. The time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) mode of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard provides a reliable solution for low-power networks through guaranteed medium access and channel diversity. However, satisfying the stringent requirements of in-vehicle networks is challenging and demands for special consideration in network formation and TSCH scheduling. This paper targets convergecast in dense in-vehicle WSNs, in which all nodes can potentially directly reach the sink node. A cross-layer low-latency topology management and TSCH scheduling (LLTT) technique is proposed that provides a very high timeslot utilization for the TSCH schedule and minimizes communication latency. It first picks a topology for the network that increases the potential of parallel TSCH communications. Then, by using an optimized graph isomorphism algorithm, it extracts a proper match in the physical connectivity graph of the network for the selected topology. This network topology is used by a lightweight TSCH schedule generator to provide low data delivery latency. Two techniques, namely grouped retransmission and periodic aggregation, are exploited to increase the performance of the TSCH communications. The experimental results show that LLTT reduces the end-to-end communication latency compared to other approaches, while keeping the communications reliable by using dedicated links and grouped retransmissions.

<p>In this paper, the influence of the flat and cap secondary, which are usually applied in the linear metro system on transverse forces of linear induction motors, is calculated and analyzed. First, the cap-aluminum plate and lamination back iron of the cap secondary caused relative difficulty in the analytical calculation. Then, the equivalent of the cap-aluminum plate and lamination back iron is presented, and two equivalent coefficients are obtained. The two types of the asymmetry are discussed and the different magnetic motive forces are presented. Second, the analytical model and the method of the linear induction motor are presented. Third, for a cap secondary in practice, the two equivalent coefficients are calculated and discussed. Then, the flat and cap secondary are applied, and the different transverse forces are calculated and analyzed. For two types of the secondaries, the different eddy currents and air-gap flux densities are compared. Finally, the test workbench is built and the analytical result of the transverse force is experimentally validated. It shows that cap secondary has less influence on the railcar when the transverse displacement occurs.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A nonisolated bidirectional dc&#x2013;dc converter with high voltage gain, low voltage stress, low component count, and soft-switching features is presented in this paper. In this topology, coupled inductors and voltage multiplier cells are merged to achieve high step-up&#x002f;down voltage gain. Also, due to using active clamp circuits, the voltage stress of power switches is relatively low. Thus, the low voltage switches with low on-resistance can be employed to reduce the conduction losses. Furthermore, zero-voltage switching is accomplished in both high step-up and high step-down modes for all power switches, and due to zero-current switching operation of all antiparallel diodes, the reverse recovery losses are reduced. In order to verify the theoretical analysis and the converter performance, a 200 W prototype circuit of the proposed converter is implemented in the laboratory.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Using multi-atlas registration (MAR), information carried by atlases can be transferred onto a new input image for the tasks of region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation, anatomical landmark detection, and so on. Conventional atlases used in MAR methods are monomodal and contain only normal anatomical structures. Therefore, the majority of MAR methods cannot handle input multimodal pathological images, which are often collected in routine image-based diagnosis. This is because registering monomodal atlases with normal appearances to multimodal pathological images involves two major problems: 1) missing imaging modalities in the monomodal atlases and 2) influence from pathological regions. In this paper, we propose a new MAR framework to tackle these problems. In this framework, deep learning-based image synthesizers are applied for synthesizing multimodal normal atlases from conventional monomodal normal atlases. To reduce the influence from pathological regions, we further propose a multimodal low-rank approach to recover multimodal normal-looking images from multimodal pathological images. Finally, the multimodal normal atlases can be registered to the recovered multimodal images in a multi-channel way. We evaluate our MAR framework via brain ROI segmentation of multimodal tumor brain images. Due to the utilization of multimodal information and the reduced influence from pathological regions, experimental results show that registration based on our method is more accurate and robust, leading to significantly improved brain ROI segmentation compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Stereoscopic saliency detection plays an important role in various stereoscopic video processing applications. However, conventional stereoscopic video saliency detection methods mainly use independent low-level features instead of extracting them automatically, and thus, they ignore the intrinsic relationship between the spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel stereoscopic video saliency detection method based on 3D convolutional neural networks, namely, deep 3D video saliency (Deep3DSaliency). The proposed network consists of two sub-models: spatiotemporal saliency model (STSM) and stereoscopic saliency aware model (SSAM). STSM directly takes three consecutive video frames as the input to extract visual spatiotemporal features, while SSAM attempts to further infer the depth and semantic features from the left and right video frames by shared parameters from STSM. The visual spatiotemporal features from STSM and the depth and semantic features from SSAM are learned by an alternating optimization scheme. Finally, all these saliency-related features are combined together for the final stereoscopic saliency detection via 3D deconvolution. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed model over other existing ones in saliency estimation for 3D video sequences.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The 360&#x00b0; video compression has two main challenges due to projection distortions, namely, the geometry distortion and the face boundary discontinuity. There are some tradeoffs between selecting equi-rectangular projection (ERP) and polyhedron projection. In ERP, the geometry distortion is severer than the face boundary discontinuity; while for the polyhedron projections, the face boundary discontinuity is severer than the geometry distortion. These two distortions will have side effects on the motion compensation and undermine the compression efficiency of the 360&#x00b0; video. In this paper, an integrated framework is developed to handle these two problems to improve coding efficiency. The proposed framework mainly has two key contributions. First, we derive a unified advanced spherical motion model to handle the geometry distortion of different projection formats for the 360&#x00b0; video. When fitting the projection between the various projection formats and the sphere into the unified framework, a specific solution can be obtained for each projection format. Second, we propose a local 3D padding method to handle the face boundary discontinuity between the neighboring faces in various projection formats of the 360&#x00b0; video. The local 3D padding method can be applied to different projection formats through setting different angles between neighboring faces. These two methods are independent of each other and can also be combined into an integrated framework to achieve a better rate-distortion performance. The proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into the latest video coding standard high-efficiency video coding. The experimental results demonstrate that introducing proposed coding tools can achieve significant bitrate savings compared with the current state-of-the-art method.
