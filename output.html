</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we consider multiple-input single-output multi-eavesdropper cognitive radio networks (MISOME-CRNs), where a secondary user (SU) aims to transmit confidential information to a legitimate SU receiver in the presence of a primary user (PU) and a multi-antenna passive eavesdropper in fast fading environments. For this system setting, we study beamforming with artificial noise (AN) for the SU to achieve confidential communications. We consider designing an AN-assisted optimal beamforming scheme, denoted cognitive beamforming (CB), which maximizes the ergodic secrecy rate. Moreover, we propose two suboptimal beamforming schemes, namely, scaled beamforming (SB) and projected beamforming (PB). We develop an analytical framework to assess the performance of the proposed schemes in a unified manner. First, we analyze the achievable ergodic secrecy rate of the three schemes. Second, we derive the optimal power allocation for the information and AN signals that maximizes the achievable ergodic secrecy rate in the large-antenna regime. Third, we study the performance of the three schemes in terms of the secrecy outage probability. Using numerical simulations, we validate our analytical results and show that CB achieves the best performance among the three proposed schemes. In addition, we provide insights into the effect of various system parameters on the secrecy performance. In particular, we show that the interference threshold at the PU plays an important role in the beamforming design.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The rapid increase in the number of Android malware poses great challenges to anti-malware systems, because the sheer number of malware samples overwhelms malware analysis systems. The classification of malware samples into families, such that the common features shared by malware samples in the same family can be exploited in malware detection and inspection, is a promising approach for accelerating malware analysis. Furthermore, the selection of representative malware samples in each family can drastically decrease the number of malware to be analyzed. However, the existing classification solutions are limited because of the following reasons. First, the legitimate part of the malware may misguide the classification algorithms because the majority of Android malware are constructed by inserting malicious components into popular apps. Second, the polymorphic variants of Android malware can evade detection by employing transformation attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that constructs frequent subgraphs (fregraphs) to represent the common behaviors of malware samples that belong to the same family. Moreover, we propose and develop FalDroid, a novel system that automatically classifies Android malware and selects representative malware samples in accordance with fregraphs. We apply it to 8407 malware samples from 36 families. Experimental results show that FalDroid can correctly classify 94.2&#x0025; of malware samples into their families using approximately 4.6 sec per app. FalDroid can also dramatically reduce the cost of malware investigation by selecting only 8.5&#x0025; to 22&#x0025; representative samples that exhibit the most common malicious behavior among all samples.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The classical threshold secret sharing scheme by Shamir requires high computation complexity. Many fast secret sharing schemes have been proposed to reduce the computation cost. Another problem of perfect secret sharing scheme is the large share size. Ramp sharing schemes were proposed as a solution to reduce the share size with sacrificing secrecy to some extent. This paper proposes a new ramp scheme, which is adapted from the zigzag-decodable erasure codes for data storage systems. The scheme is shown to approach a linear ramp scheme when the secret size grows to infinity. It is conceptually easy to understand, and has low computation cost, since both its encoding and decoding algorithms are based only on the XOR and bitwise-shift operations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Providing high trustworthy service is the most fundamental task for any cloud computing platform. Users are willing to deliver their computing tasks and the most sensitive data to cloud data centers, which is based on the trust relationship established between users and cloud service providers. However, with the development of collaboration cloud computing, how to provider fast response for a large number of users&#x2019; service requests becomes a challenging problem. In order to quickly provide highly trustworthy services, the service platform must efficiently and quickly reply tens of millions of service requests, and automatically match-make tens of thousands of service resources. In this context, lightweight and fast (high-speed, low-overhead) trust computing schemes become the fundamental demand for implementing a trustworthy and collaborative cloud service. In this paper, we propose an innovative and parallel trust computing scheme based on big data analysis for the trustworthy cloud service environment. First, a distributed and modular perceiving architecture for large-scale virtual machines&#x2019; service behavior is proposed relying on distributed monitoring agents. Then, an adaptive, lightweight, and parallel trust computing scheme is proposed for big monitored data. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to use a blocked and parallel computing mechanism, the speed of trust calculation is greatly accelerated, which makes this trust computing scheme very suitable for a large-scale cloud computing environment. Performance analysis and experimental results verify feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Craniofacial superimposition aims to identify a missing person by comparing its skull with photos of possible candidates. Among the difficult tasks involved, this requires superimposing the skull over each photo, matching the pose of the skull with that of the face, a problem known as skull-face overlay (SFO). Several computerized methods for SFO have been proposed, in an effort to relieve forensic experts of this complex, time-consuming, and subjective task. A system to generate artificial SFO data from computed tomography images has been also introduced, providing researchers with data to test and compare their techniques more reliably. This paper improves the state of the art on both fronts. We introduce a novel SFO algorithm that is substantially more accurate, more reliable, and much faster than the existing methods. An extensive experimental study and statistical analysis validates our findings. Moreover, we propose an improved method to simulate SFO data which, by replacing real photos with simulated ones, is able to generate a wider range of scenarios.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Considering the unknown dynamics of the multiple-input-multiple-output strict-feedback nonlinear systems, this paper proposed the neural composite learning control using the online recorded data. The control structure follows the back-stepping scheme, while neural networks (NNs) are employed for uncertainty approximation. Through the error dynamics analysis, the critical prediction error is constructed to indicate the performance of intelligent learning over the interval. Furthermore, the novel composite learning law is proposed for NN weights update. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed via the Lyapunov approach and the signals are guaranteed to be bounded. Through simulation test of two-input and two-output systems, the proposed controller can achieve better tracking performance, while with the composite learning algorithm, the NNs can efficiently approximate nonlinear functions. Similar conclusions are obtained on the control of the hypersonic reentry vehicle.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper introduces a new fault-tolerant strategy for a cascaded H-bridge (CHB)-based static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) with a single failure in power switches. A modified selective harmonic elimination pulse width modulation technique is proposed for postfault operation which generates the maximum possible balanced line-to-line voltages at the ac side of the converter. The dc-link voltages of H-bridge cells are used as another degree of freedom; and by an efficient amount of increase at the dc-link voltages, the rated capacity of STATCOM is restored without any extra component. Furthermore, by applying an effective voltage balancing scheme, voltages of dc-side capacitors are kept balanced in postfault operation. A three-phase seven-level CHB-based STATCOM is simulated in PSCAD&#x002f;EMTDC environment to verify the feasibility and performance of the proposed method and also experimental results are provided based on a three-phase five-level scaled down laboratory prototype which validates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper handles the distributed cooperative fault detection problem for multiagent systems (MASs) with additive type of faults and external disturbances. A distributed cooperative fault detection scheme is proposed through which the strict requirement on single agent&#x0027;s performance can be released. Moreover, a mixed  $H_{infty }/H_2$ optimization approach is presented to guarantee that the cooperative fault detection scheme can get a proper compromise between sensitivity to faults and robustness to disturbances on the network level. In order to be applicable with MASs, a distributed implementation of the proposed scheme is developed by applying an iterative approach. Effectiveness and improvements of the proposed scheme are validated on a multivehicle experimental platform.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a new filter design method that can smooth the wind power generation output while keeping the energy capacity and power rating of the energy storage system (ESS) small. Wind power generation causes frequency fluctuations in power systems. Therefore, in many cases, the ESS is needed for smoothing the fluctuations of wind generator output. In order to improve the performance of the ESS controlled with the conventional low-pass filter (LPF), this paper investigates other types of filters. First, the relations between filter and energy capacity/power rating of the ESS are disclosed through the worst-case study. Then, the frequency fluctuation analysis of the power system with respect to the wind power generation is carried out in order to realize a pin-point smoothing. Finally, a metaheuristic optimization method is proposed for the multiobjective design of the filter based on these relations so as to achieve an optimal tradeoff between the output smoothing and energy capacity/power rating of the ESS. It is shown via simulation analysis with real wind data that the proposed method can suppress the frequency fluctuation of the power system effectively with the ESS having smaller energy capacity and power rating.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper concentrates on the problem of control of a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) for an improved and optimized operation of load-frequency control applications. The HESS consists of a supercapacitor serving as the main power source and a fuel cell serving as the auxiliary power source. First, a Hammerstein-type neural network is proposed to identify the HESS, which formulates the Hammerstein model with a nonlinear static gain in cascade with a linear dynamic block. It provides the model information for the controller to achieve the adaptive performance. Second, a feedforward neural network based on a back-propagation training algorithm is designed to formulate the proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-type neural network, which is used for the adaptive control of the HESS. Meanwhile, a dynamic antiwindup signal is designed to solve the operational constraint of the HESS. Then, an appropriate power reference signal for the HESS can be generated. Third, the stability and the convergence of the whole system are proved based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, simulation experiments are followed through on a four-area interconnected power system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Current trends in industrial systems opt for the use of different big-data engines as a means to process huge amounts of data that cannot be processed with an ordinary infrastructure. The number of issues an industrial infrastructure has to face is large and includes challenges such as the definition of different efficient architecture setups for different applications, and the definition of specific models for industrial analytics. In this context, this paper explores the development of a medium size big-data engine (i.e., implementation) able to improve the performance in map-reduce computing by splitting the analytic into different segments that may be processed by the engine in parallel using a hierarchical model. This type of facility reduces end-to-end computation time for all segments with their results then merged with other information from other segments after their processing in parallel. This type of setup increases the performance of current clusters improving I/O operations remarkably as empirical results revealed.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper investigates the impact of load profiling attributes on the demand response exchange (DRX) mechanism. Modeling of demand response (DR) seller bids in traditional approach/model includes a customer willingness factor assigned in a random/arbitrary manner. The proposed model of DR bids takes into account, the load attributes such as utilization and availability factors. The criticality and willingness of the DR load/customer are embedded into seller market bids through utilization and availability factor, respectively. Various cost models have been developed to emulate the possible customer behavior in DR cost modeling. However, modeling of indistinct and uncertain nature of customer behavior is a complex issue in real-time consideration. Therefore, this paper also presents a fuzzy inference system (FIS) for considering the customer load profile attributes in DR bids. In addition, parameter tuning of fuzzy membership functions is also carried out in this paper using heuristic optimization techniques to improve the performance of FIS in DRX clearing. The proposed methodology with load profile attributes is simulated considering various load types across different load sectors. Simulation results of proposed tuned FIS-based DRX clearing are compared with other nonfuzzy models, conventional models without load attributes and untuned FIS system to demonstrate the effectiveness of tuned FIS with load profile attribute consideration in DRX clearing.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a scheme aimed at mitigating the influence of random data transmission delays in networked thermal appliance control systems in smart buildings. The impact of this type of delays is first analyzed, and it is proposed to utilize loose timing synchronization and add blank gaps between the consecutive appliance operations to avoid the possible violation of the given power budget. A cooperative control of thermal appliance operation is developed using a networked model predictive control-based controller to deal with delays. It is also shown that the schedulability of such a control scheme can be assessed online. The performance of the proposed control scheme is assessed by a simulation study based on the thermal dynamics of an eight-room office building. The obtained results show that the proposed solution can achieve an efficient power peaks shaving in the presence of random network delays.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Traditional medical privacy data are at a serious risk of disclosure, and many related cases have occurred over the years. For example, personal medical privacy data can be easily leaked to insurance companies, which not only compromises the privacy of individuals, but also hinders the healthy development of the medical industry. With the continuous improvement of cloud computing and big data technologies, the Internet of Things technology has been rapidly developed. Radio frequency identification (RFID) is one of the core technologies of the Internet of Things. The application of the RFID system to the medical system can effectively solve this problem of medical privacy. RFID tags in the system can collect useful information and conduct data exchange and processing with a back-end server through the reader. The whole process of information interaction is mainly in the form of ciphertext. In the context of the Internet of Things, the paper presents a lightweight RFID medical privacy protection scheme. The scheme ensures security privacy of the collected data via secure authentication. The security analysis and evaluation of the scheme indicate that the protocol can effectively prevent the risk of medical privacy data being easily leaked.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a multirobot system for manufacturing personalized medical stent grafts. The proposed system adopts a modular design, which includes a (personalized) mandrel module, a bimanual sewing module, and a vision module. The mandrel module incorporates the personalized geometry of patients, while the bimanual sewing module adopts a learning-by-demonstration approach to transfer human hand-sewing skills to the robots. The human demonstrations were first observed by the vision module and then encoded using a statistical model to generate the reference motion trajectories. During autonomous robot sewing, the vision module plays the role of coordinating multirobot collaboration. Experimental results show that the robots can adapt to generalized stent designs. The proposed system can also be used for other manipulation tasks, especially for flexible production of customized products and where bimanual or multirobot cooperation is required.

<p>Universal health coverage (UHC) has assumed an iconic place in work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Its central importance for achieving SDG 3&#8212;ensuring healthy lives for all&#8212;is proven by the increasingly sophisticated efforts to measure UHC and to estimate to what extent UHC can be achieved by 2030. An example is the Global Burden of Disease (GBD).1 The GBD team constructed a UHC Index by beginning with the idea of access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Dear Human (video), a hip-hop video was developed as part of the project Measuring Humanity.1 Working with marginalised groups, the participant-led research programme uses bottom-up creative community engagement to challenge policy makers and academics to reassess what counts as evidence when developing policies, practices, and recommendations. The video features rapping written using co-produced data from marginalised community members, health and voluntary sector practitioners, and researchers.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Clinicians and patients are getting out of touch with one another. When I was a medical student, I spent hours with patients, examining them on the ward, taking blood, and assisting at operations. At first I felt clumsy, inept, and embarrassed at the prospect of physical contact, for touch is surrounded by social conventions and taboos that are difficult to break through. But gradually, through practice, I became more confident. Touching people stopped feeling strange. Ostensibly, the purpose of these examinations was to gather diagnostic information that I would relay to senior clinicians.

<p>Zarocostas J. Libya: war and migration strain a broken health system. Lancet 2018; 391: 824&#8211;25&#8212;In this World Report, the third paragraph should have read &#8220;Libya is now entering its eighth year of conflict and instability, which first engulfed the nation when in February, 2011, dictator of 42 years Muammar Gaddafi used violence to crush pro-democracy demonstrations. The violent clampdown sparked a civil war that led to Gaddafi's ouster from power in August, 2011, by his rebel opponents&#8212;backed by strong aerial and naval support from western powers.&#8221; This correction has been made to the online version as of March 14, 2018.
