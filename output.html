<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Next time you are in a library, open a random 16th-century book. There is a good chance that it contains a number of early handwritten annotations, underlinings, and haphazard jottings. Most books printed before 1600 were marked up by their readers in such a manner. A careful study of these annotations can reveal how readers responded to books, and what impact printed books had on the early modern world. We can examine how studiously the composer Johann Sebastian Bach read his Bible, and how much the protestant reformer Martin Luther disliked his contemporary author Erasmus of Rotterdam, writing &#8220;You are crazy&#8221; on the margins of Erasmus' edition of the New Testament.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/issue/current">The Lancet</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In writing about the failed abortion bill in Argentina, the Editors (Aug 18, 2018, p 532)1 missed the opportunity to provide insight or viable solutions for Argentinian women in the wake of these events. Despite Argentina's 2010 reproductive health law that guarantees universal access to barrier, medical, and surgical contraception, women fail to receive these services. According to official figures from 2010,2 up to half a million abortions are induced each year. In 2016, abortion was recorded as the cause of about 18% of maternal deaths.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The emotive and well-written Editorial1 about the failed abortion bill in Argentina requires an important clarification. The Catholic Church is not opposed to women's rights but rather opposes abortion. This is a significant distinction. The Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (CAFOD) is an international Catholic charity dedicated to the advancement of women's rights and gender equality in South America and other parts of the world. Support for abortion is not synonymous with the championing of women's rights, as suggested in the Editorial.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fractional interpolation is used to provide sub-pixel level references for motion compensation in the interprediction of video coding, which attempts to remove temporal redundancy in video sequences. Traditional handcrafted fractional interpolation filters face the challenge of modeling discontinuous regions in videos, while existing deep learning-based methods are either designed for a single quantization parameter (QP), only generating half-pixel samples, or need to train a model for each sub-pixel position. In this paper, we present a one-for-all fractional interpolation method based on a grouped variation convolutional neural network (GVCNN). Our method can deal with video frames coded using different QPs and is capable of generating all sub-pixel positions at one sub-pixel level. Also, by predicting variations between integer-position pixels and sub-pixels, our network offers more expressive power. Moreover, we perform specific measurements in training data generation to simulate practical situations in video coding, including blurring the down-sampled sub-pixel samples to avoid aliasing effects and coding integer pixels to simulate reconstruction errors. In addition, we analyze the impact of the size of blur kernels theoretically. Experimental results verify the efficiency of GVCNN. Compared with HEVC, our method achieves 2.2% in bit saving on average and up to 5.2% under low-delay P configuration.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel screen-shooting resilient watermarking scheme, which means that if the watermarked image is displayed on the screen and the screen information is captured by the camera, we can still extract the watermark message from the captured photo. To realize such demands, we analyzed the special distortions caused by the screen-shooting process, including lens distortion, light source distortion, and moir&#x00e9; distortion. To resist the geometric deformation caused by lens distortion, we proposed an intensity-based scale-invariant feature transform (I-SIFT) algorithm which can accurately locate the embedding regions. As for the loss of image details caused by light source distortion and moir&#x00e9; distortion, we put forward a small-size template algorithm to repeatedly embed the watermark into different regions, so that at least one complete information region can survive from distortions. At the extraction side, we designed a cross-validation-based extraction algorithm to cope with repeated embedding. The validity and correctness of the extraction method are verified by hypothesis testing. Furthermore, to boost the extraction speed, we proposed a SIFT feature editing algorithm to enhance the intensity of the keypoints, based on which, the extraction accuracy and extraction speed can be greatly improved. The experimental results show that the proposed watermarking scheme achieves high robustness for screen-shooting process. Compared with the previous schemes, our algorithm provides significant improvement in robustness for screen-shooting process and extraction efficiency.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Video watermarking is a well-established technology to help identify digital pirates when they illegally re-distribute multimedia content. In order to provide every client with a unique, watermarked video, the traditional distribution architectures separately encode each watermarked video. However, since these encodings require a high amount of computational resources, such architectures do not scale well to a large number of users. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel architecture that uses fast encoders instead of traditional, full encoders. The fast encoders re-use the coding information from a single, previously-encoded, unwatermarked video in order to speed up the encodings of the watermarked videos. As a result, the complexity of a fast encoder is only a fraction of the complexity of a full encoder. Due to a high correlation of the re-used coding information with the optimal coding information, the compression efficiency and watermark robustness decrease only slightly. Most importantly, the proposed fast encoder speeds up the compression process with a factor of 115, resulting in a low complexity similar to that of a video decoder. Consequently, video distributors can use the proposed architecture to deliver high-quality watermarked videos on a large-scale without requiring an excessive amount of computational resources.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Most existing Android malware detection and categorization techniques are static approaches, which suffer from evasion attacks, such as obfuscation. By analyzing program behaviors, dynamic approaches are potentially more resilient against these attacks. Yet existing dynamic approaches mostly rely on characterizing system calls which are subject to system-call obfuscation. This paper presents DroidCat, a novel dynamic app classification technique, to complement existing approaches. By using a diverse set of dynamic features based on method calls and inter-component communication (ICC) Intents without involving permission, app resources, or system calls while fully handling reflection, DroidCat achieves superior robustness than static approaches as well as dynamic approaches relying on system calls. The features were distilled from a behavioral characterization study of benign versus malicious apps. Through three complementary evaluation studies with 34 343 apps from various sources and spanning the past nine years, we demonstrated the stability of DroidCat in achieving high classification performance and superior accuracy compared with the two state-of-the-art peer techniques that represent both static and dynamic approaches. Overall, DroidCat achieved 97&#x0025; F1-measure accuracy consistently for classifying apps evolving over the nine years, detecting or categorizing malware, 16&#x0025;&#x2013;27&#x0025; higher than any of the two baselines compared. Furthermore, our experiments with obfuscated benchmarks confirmed higher robustness of DroidCat over these baseline techniques. We also investigated the effects of various design decisions on DroidCat&#x2019;s effectiveness and the most important features for our dynamic classification. We found that features capturing app execution structure such as the distribution of method calls over us-
r code and libraries are much more important than typical security features such as sensitive flows.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Because of the dynamic nature of network traffic patterns, such as new traffic application arrivals or flash events, it is becoming increasingly difficult for conventional anomaly detection systems to separate various applications based on their traffic patterns. In this paper, by leveraging transport layer packet-level and flow-level features, new structures called application fingerprints are generated, which express such features in a compact and efficient manner. Based on the generated fingerprints, we propose a novel traffic classification framework. The proposed system generates profiles of normal applications using a multi-modal probability distribution. The proposed classification framework is then extended to detect distributed denial of service attacks from the collected statistical information at flow level. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system, we evaluate its performance using five real-world traffic datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method is capable of achieving an accuracy of over 97&#x0025;, whereas the misclassification rate is only 2.5&#x0025;.

<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) botnets have become one of the major threats in network security for serving as the fundamental infrastructure for various cyber-crimes. More challenges are involved in the problem of detecting P2P botnets, despite a few work claimed to detect centralized botnets effectively. We propose an enhanced PeerHunter, a network-flow level community behavior analysis based system, to detect P2P botnets. Our system starts from a P2P network flow detection component. Then, it uses &#x201c;mutual contacts&#x201d; to cluster bots into communities. Finally, it uses network-flow level community behavior analysis to detect potential botnets. In the experimental evaluation, we propose two evasion attacks, where we assume the adversaries know our techniques in advance and attempt to evade our system by making the P2P bots mimic the behavior of legitimate P2P applications. Our results showed that enhanced PeerHunter can obtain high detection rate with few false positives, and high robustness against the proposed attacks.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Facial expression recognition in the wild is challenging due to various unconstrained conditions. Although existing facial expression classifiers have been almost perfect on analyzing constrained frontal faces, they fail to perform well on partially occluded faces that are common in the wild. In this paper, we propose a convolution neutral network (CNN) with attention mechanism (ACNN) that can perceive the occlusion regions of the face and focus on the most discriminative un-occluded regions. ACNN is an end-to-end learning framework. It combines the multiple representations from facial regions of interest (ROIs). Each representation is weighed via a proposed gate unit that computes an adaptive weight from the region itself according to the unobstructedness and importance. Considering different RoIs, we introduce two versions of ACNN: patch-based ACNN (pACNN) and global&#x2013;local-based ACNN (gACNN). pACNN only pays attention to local facial patches. gACNN integrates local representations at patch-level with global representation at image-level. The proposed ACNNs are evaluated on both real and synthetic occlusions, including a self-collected facial expression dataset with real-world occlusions, the two largest in-the-wild facial expression datasets (RAF-DB and AffectNet) and their modifications with synthesized facial occlusions. Experimental results show that ACNNs improve the recognition accuracy on both the non-occluded faces and occluded faces. Visualization results demonstrate that, compared with the CNN without Gate Unit, ACNNs are capable of shifting the attention from the occluded patches to other related but unobstructed ones. ACNNs also outperform other state-of-the-art methods on several widely used in-the-lab facial expression datasets under the cross-dataset evaluation protocol.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) is changing the way modern information systems that are designed, operated, and evolved. SOC makes possible to aggregate distributed resources at the phases of decision-making support and system operations. When myriads of resources with similar functionalities are available, effective methodologies are demanded to select services and compose them as service workflows for the specified goals. The computation for workflow composition is very complex since it depends on the numbers of services and their dynamic characteristics. Therefore, composing optimized workflows in a timely manner poses a great challenge. We are highly motivated to reduce the complexity of service selection and composition. The formalized semantics in SWSpec is extended so that unqualified or inferior services can be eliminated directly from the scope of the design solution space. In this paper, a brief review of the proposed SWSpec language is given and the focus is on the sematic formalization. A new compositional proof-system is developed with a set of inference rules and the proven system properties. The proposed semantic formalization has its great significance in reducing the complexity of composing workflows and developing efficient algorithms for compliance checking.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Safety-critical systems implemented on multicore platforms need to satisfy stringent power dissipation constraints such as thermal design power (TDP) thresholds used by chip manufacturers. Power dissipation beyond TDP may trigger dynamic thermal management (DTM) in order to ensure thermal stability of the system. However, the application of DTM makes the system susceptible to higher unpredictability and performance degradations for real-time tasks. This paper proposes a formal scheduler synthesis framework that guarantees adherence to a system level peak power constraint while allowing optimal resource utilization in multicores. Our proposed framework makes use of supervisory control of timed discrete event systems as the underlying formalism. All steps starting from individual models to construction of the scheduler have been implemented through binary decision diagram based symbolic computation, so that the state-space complexity associated with the framework may be controlled. Furthermore, the synthesis framework has been extended to handle tasks with phased execution behavior. Conducted experiments have shown promising results and indicate to the practical efficacy of our approach.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Uncertainty management is a challenging task in decision making of the operators of the power systems. Prediction of the system state is vital for the operation of a system with stochastic behavior especially in a power system with a significant amount of renewable energies such as wind power. Predictable power systems are in more interest of operators, of course. This paper proposes a multiobjective framework for optimal placement and parameters setting of a unified power flow controller (UPFC) considering system predictability. The well-known multiobjective nondominated sorting genetic algorithm is implemented to handle various objective functions such as active power losses and predictability of system in the presence of operational constraints and uncertainties. The point estimate method is used for modeling probabilistic nature of the wind power. Using the proposed method, statistical information of voltage magnitude and apparent power of converters of UPFCs can be obtained, which are very useful in making decision on the sizing of UPFCs. Comprehensive discussions are provided using the simulations on the IEEE 57-bus test system. Also, in order to validate the obtained results, a multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm is implemented and the results of two algorithms are compared with each other.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation is a technique that is being used increasingly in the development and test of complex systems. Real-world testing of an intricate system in a field-like power plant can be challenging, time-consuming, expensive, and hazardous. HIL emulators allow engineers to test devices thoroughly and efficiently in a virtual environment with high reliability and minimum risk of defect. In this paper, the complete electric power system (including generator, turbine-governor, excitation system, transmission lines, transformer, external grid and related loads) is implemented in a MATLAB&#x002f;Simulink environment. Different virtual instrument pages are modeled in the graphical programming language of LabVIEW which enable fast and reliable measurement functions such as data acquisition, archiving, real-time graphical display and processing. The interaction between MATLAB and LabVIEW is accomplished by generating a Pharlap ETS Targets <sup>&#x002a;</sup>.dll file which enables the two software to exchange real-time data. Also, a real 1518-kW excitation system is considered as a test case for the introduced HIL system. This equipment is connected to LabVIEW software through a National Instrument PXI technology. Different scenarios (electrical frequency&#x002f;active power change, voltage step response, etc.) are simulated in the designed power system emulator (PSE). The validity of the implemented model for the excitation system is verified by finding good matching between MATLAB and HIL simulation results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are considered as a promising solution in intravehicle networking to reduce wiring and production costs. This application requires reliable and real-time data delivery, while the network is very dense. The time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) mode of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard provides a reliable solution for low-power networks through guaranteed medium access and channel diversity. However, satisfying the stringent requirements of in-vehicle networks is challenging and demands for special consideration in network formation and TSCH scheduling. This paper targets convergecast in dense in-vehicle WSNs, in which all nodes can potentially directly reach the sink node. A cross-layer low-latency topology management and TSCH scheduling (LLTT) technique is proposed that provides a very high timeslot utilization for the TSCH schedule and minimizes communication latency. It first picks a topology for the network that increases the potential of parallel TSCH communications. Then, by using an optimized graph isomorphism algorithm, it extracts a proper match in the physical connectivity graph of the network for the selected topology. This network topology is used by a lightweight TSCH schedule generator to provide low data delivery latency. Two techniques, namely grouped retransmission and periodic aggregation, are exploited to increase the performance of the TSCH communications. The experimental results show that LLTT reduces the end-to-end communication latency compared to other approaches, while keeping the communications reliable by using dedicated links and grouped retransmissions.

<p>In this paper, the influence of the flat and cap secondary, which are usually applied in the linear metro system on transverse forces of linear induction motors, is calculated and analyzed. First, the cap-aluminum plate and lamination back iron of the cap secondary caused relative difficulty in the analytical calculation. Then, the equivalent of the cap-aluminum plate and lamination back iron is presented, and two equivalent coefficients are obtained. The two types of the asymmetry are discussed and the different magnetic motive forces are presented. Second, the analytical model and the method of the linear induction motor are presented. Third, for a cap secondary in practice, the two equivalent coefficients are calculated and discussed. Then, the flat and cap secondary are applied, and the different transverse forces are calculated and analyzed. For two types of the secondaries, the different eddy currents and air-gap flux densities are compared. Finally, the test workbench is built and the analytical result of the transverse force is experimentally validated. It shows that cap secondary has less influence on the railcar when the transverse displacement occurs.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we first proposed a novel hybrid loop array (HLA) for low leakage electromagnetic field (EMF) level and high efficiency in a wireless high power transfer system. The proposed HLA effectively enhances the system efficiency and shields leakage EMF in a wireless power transfer (WPT) system using kHz range resonant frequency. The key originality of the proposed HLA is the combination of two types of loop coil; shielding loop coil (SLC) and amplifying loop coil (ALC). SLCs reduce leakage EMF, and ALCs significantly enhance the magnetic field from a Tx coil. The simulation and experiment results show that the proposed solution successfully overcomes the limitations of the existing solutions. Analytical modeling and design procedure are introduced and discussed. In addition, the experimental verification of the simulation result is included. We first designed and modeled an HLA considering the coupling effect of neighboring loop coils to evaluate its efficiency and leakage EMF. With the proposed HLA, we demonstrated a 9.36&#x0025; improvement in the efficiency and 3&#x00a0;dBm reduction in the leakage EMF near the WPT system.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Model-predictive current control (MPCC) is a promising candidate for modular multilevel converter (MMC) control due to its advantages of direct modeling and fast dynamic response. The conventional MPCC, which obtains the optimal control input by evaluating a cost function for all the possible switching states, may make the MPCC impractical due to the exponentially increasing computation burden with the increasing number of submodules (SMs). On the other hand, the MPCC experiences high load current and circulating current tracking errors, since only one switching state is selected and applied during one control period. To address these issues, this paper proposes an MPCC with phase-shifted pulsewidth modulation (PS-PWM) for improving the steady-state control performance. The arm voltages are considered as a whole to implement the proposed MPCC. The optimal duty cycle is obtained based on the load and circulating current tracking error minimization and applied using the PS-PWM. As a result, the computation burden is unrelated to the number of SMs by avoiding the exhaustive evaluation process for all the possible switching states. A better steady-state performance with smaller tracking errors is achieved with the similar switching frequency, and the tedious tuning process of the weighting factor is eliminated. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPCC.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A nonisolated bidirectional dc&#x2013;dc converter with high voltage gain, low voltage stress, low component count, and soft-switching features is presented in this paper. In this topology, coupled inductors and voltage multiplier cells are merged to achieve high step-up&#x002f;down voltage gain. Also, due to using active clamp circuits, the voltage stress of power switches is relatively low. Thus, the low voltage switches with low on-resistance can be employed to reduce the conduction losses. Furthermore, zero-voltage switching is accomplished in both high step-up and high step-down modes for all power switches, and due to zero-current switching operation of all antiparallel diodes, the reverse recovery losses are reduced. In order to verify the theoretical analysis and the converter performance, a 200 W prototype circuit of the proposed converter is implemented in the laboratory.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The dc microgrid (MG) system has several advantages over the ac one. Therefore, it recently became a preferred architecture in numerous industrial applications. Many loads in dc MGs are electronically regulated and they challenge the stability of the system due to their constant power load (CPL) behavior. This letter proposes a systematic and simple approach to design an improved state feedback controller for the power buffer that can stabilize the dc MGs with multiple CPLs. Based on the so-called sector nonlinearity approach, the nonlinear dc MG with several CPLs is exactly represented in a Takagi&#x2013;Sugeno fuzzy model. Then, by employing the quadratic D-stability theory, the sufficient conditions to guarantee the stability and transient performance of the closed-loop system are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), such that the decay rate and oscillatory behavior of the closed-loop dc MG system are guaranteed to lie inside a predefined region. The LMI conditions can be numerically solved by utilizing the YALMIP toolbox in the MATLAB. Finally, to illustrate the merits and implementation validity of the proposed approach, some hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulation (RTS) results on a dc MG, which feeds two CPLs, are presented. In comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques, the RTS results indicate the simplicity, validity, and better performance of the proposed approach. According to the results, one can conclude that the proposed approach not only theoretically assures the stability but also guarantees the fast convergence and less oscillatory response of the dc MGs with multiple CPLs.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Using multi-atlas registration (MAR), information carried by atlases can be transferred onto a new input image for the tasks of region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation, anatomical landmark detection, and so on. Conventional atlases used in MAR methods are monomodal and contain only normal anatomical structures. Therefore, the majority of MAR methods cannot handle input multimodal pathological images, which are often collected in routine image-based diagnosis. This is because registering monomodal atlases with normal appearances to multimodal pathological images involves two major problems: 1) missing imaging modalities in the monomodal atlases and 2) influence from pathological regions. In this paper, we propose a new MAR framework to tackle these problems. In this framework, deep learning-based image synthesizers are applied for synthesizing multimodal normal atlases from conventional monomodal normal atlases. To reduce the influence from pathological regions, we further propose a multimodal low-rank approach to recover multimodal normal-looking images from multimodal pathological images. Finally, the multimodal normal atlases can be registered to the recovered multimodal images in a multi-channel way. We evaluate our MAR framework via brain ROI segmentation of multimodal tumor brain images. Due to the utilization of multimodal information and the reduced influence from pathological regions, experimental results show that registration based on our method is more accurate and robust, leading to significantly improved brain ROI segmentation compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Stereoscopic saliency detection plays an important role in various stereoscopic video processing applications. However, conventional stereoscopic video saliency detection methods mainly use independent low-level features instead of extracting them automatically, and thus, they ignore the intrinsic relationship between the spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel stereoscopic video saliency detection method based on 3D convolutional neural networks, namely, deep 3D video saliency (Deep3DSaliency). The proposed network consists of two sub-models: spatiotemporal saliency model (STSM) and stereoscopic saliency aware model (SSAM). STSM directly takes three consecutive video frames as the input to extract visual spatiotemporal features, while SSAM attempts to further infer the depth and semantic features from the left and right video frames by shared parameters from STSM. The visual spatiotemporal features from STSM and the depth and semantic features from SSAM are learned by an alternating optimization scheme. Finally, all these saliency-related features are combined together for the final stereoscopic saliency detection via 3D deconvolution. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed model over other existing ones in saliency estimation for 3D video sequences.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The 360&#x00b0; video compression has two main challenges due to projection distortions, namely, the geometry distortion and the face boundary discontinuity. There are some tradeoffs between selecting equi-rectangular projection (ERP) and polyhedron projection. In ERP, the geometry distortion is severer than the face boundary discontinuity; while for the polyhedron projections, the face boundary discontinuity is severer than the geometry distortion. These two distortions will have side effects on the motion compensation and undermine the compression efficiency of the 360&#x00b0; video. In this paper, an integrated framework is developed to handle these two problems to improve coding efficiency. The proposed framework mainly has two key contributions. First, we derive a unified advanced spherical motion model to handle the geometry distortion of different projection formats for the 360&#x00b0; video. When fitting the projection between the various projection formats and the sphere into the unified framework, a specific solution can be obtained for each projection format. Second, we propose a local 3D padding method to handle the face boundary discontinuity between the neighboring faces in various projection formats of the 360&#x00b0; video. The local 3D padding method can be applied to different projection formats through setting different angles between neighboring faces. These two methods are independent of each other and can also be combined into an integrated framework to achieve a better rate-distortion performance. The proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into the latest video coding standard high-efficiency video coding. The experimental results demonstrate that introducing proposed coding tools can achieve significant bitrate savings compared with the current state-of-the-art method.
