<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Head mounted displays bring eye tracking into daily use and this raises
privacy concerns for users. Privacy-preservation techniques such as
differential privacy mechanisms are recently applied to the eye tracking data
obtained from such displays; however, standard differential privacy mechanisms
are vulnerable to temporal correlations in the eye movement features. In this
work, a transform coding based differential privacy mechanism is proposed for
the first time in the eye tracking literature to further adapt it to statistics
of eye movement feature data by comparing various low-complexity methods.
Fourier Perturbation Algorithm, which is a differential privacy mechanism, is
extended and a scaling mistake in its proof is corrected. Significant
reductions in correlations in addition to query sensitivities are illustrated,
which provide the best utility-privacy trade-off in the literature for the eye
tracking dataset used. The differentially private eye movement data are
evaluated also for classification accuracies for gender and document-type
predictions to show that higher privacy is obtained without a reduction in the
classification accuracies by using proposed methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Randomized classifiers have been shown to provide a promising approach for
achieving certified robustness against adversarial attacks in deep learning.
However, most existing methods only leverage Gaussian smoothing noise and only
work for $\ell_2$ perturbation. We propose a general framework of adversarial
certification with non-Gaussian noise and for more general types of attacks,
from a unified functional optimization perspective. Our new framework allows us
to identify a key trade-off between accuracy and robustness via designing
smoothing distributions, helping to design new families of non-Gaussian
smoothing distributions that work more efficiently for different $\ell_p$
settings, including $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ attacks. Our proposed
methods achieve better certification results than previous works and provide a
new perspective on randomized smoothing certification.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We consider the problem of learning Markov Random Fields (including the
prototypical example, the Ising model) under the constraint of differential
privacy. Our learning goals include both structure learning, where we try to
estimate the underlying graph structure of the model, as well as the harder
goal of parameter learning, in which we additionally estimate the parameter on
each edge. We provide algorithms and lower bounds for both problems under a
variety of privacy constraints -- namely pure, concentrated, and approximate
differential privacy. While non-privately, both learning goals enjoy roughly
the same complexity, we show that this is not the case under differential
privacy. In particular, only structure learning under approximate differential
privacy maintains the non-private logarithmic dependence on the dimensionality
of the data, while a change in either the learning goal or the privacy notion
would necessitate a polynomial dependence. As a result, we show that the
privacy constraint imposes a strong separation between these two learning
problems in the high-dimensional data regime.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A fundamental conflict of many proof-of-work systems is that they want to
achieve inclusiveness and security at the same time. We analyze and resolve
this conflict with a theory of proof-of-work quorums, which enables a new
bridge between Byzantine and Nakamoto consensus. The theory yields stochastic
uniqueness of quorums as a function of a security parameter. We employ the
theory in HotPoW, a scalable permissionless distributed log protocol that
supports finality based on the pipelined three-phase commit previously
presented for HotStuff. We evaluate HotPoW and variants with adversarial
modifications by simulation. Results show that the protocol can tolerate
network latency, churn, and targeted attacks on consistency and liveness with a
small storage overhead compared to plain Nakamoto consensus and less complexity
than protocols that rely on sidechains for finality.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Parameter-transfer is a well-known and versatile approach for meta-learning,
with applications including few-shot learning, federated learning, and
reinforcement learning. However, parameter-transfer algorithms often require
sharing models that have been trained on the samples from specific tasks, thus
leaving the task-owners susceptible to breaches of privacy. We conduct the
first formal study of privacy in this setting and formalize the notion of
task-global differential privacy as a practical relaxation of more commonly
studied threat models. We then propose a new differentially private algorithm
for gradient-based parameter transfer that not only satisfies this privacy
requirement but also retains provable transfer learning guarantees in convex
settings. Empirically, we apply our analysis to the problems of federated
learning with personalization and few-shot classification, showing that
allowing the relaxation to task-global privacy from the more commonly studied
notion of local privacy leads to dramatically increased performance in
recurrent neural language modeling and image classification.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To the Editor In a propensity score&#8211;matched cohort of 578 patients from 4 observational cohort studies, Dr Kuramatsu and colleagues showed that evacuation of medium-sized intracerebellar hematomas (approximate volume, 20 cm3) was not associated with better functional outcome. Assessing treatment effectiveness in observational data is challenging because treatment decisions are based on patient characteristics that also are typically predictive of outcome, causing confounding by indication. Although the authors addressed this potential bias with propensity scores, we would like to emphasize the possibility of residual confounding.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Water-filled mining goaves are extremely prone to water inrush accidents in coal mines, and the transient electromagnetic method (TEM) is a good geophysical method for detecting water-rich areas. Considering that conventional TEM was mainly carried out on the ground, to increase the detection resolution, the underground TEM was used to detect the water-filled goaves in this study. Based on the whole-space model, the data-processing method of the underground TEM was studied. The whole-space geoelectric model was established based on actual coal-measure strata data, and the whole-space TEM response of the water-filled goaves was modeled using the finite-difference time-domain method. The results showed that the low-resistance areas of the apparent resistivity contours can accurately reflect the water abundance of the mining goaves. The underground TEM was used to detect the water abundance of the mining goaf in a mine environment and its detection results were consistent with the actual results.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Traditional offline programming or teach pendant-based methods limit the collaboration capabilities of users and robots to cope with complex and changing industrial tasks. To address efficient robot manipulation in high-mix and low-volume tasks, especially for skillful tasks involving both trajectory and force control requirements, fast robot teaching and skill transferability are critical. Compared to manually dragging a heavy robot, or programming a trajectory by complex calculations, we believe that robots can efficiently learn skills from direct teaching through telemanipulation, and improve the skills based on optimization with sensory feedback. In aerospace engine, maintenance, repair, and operations, the surfaces of aerospace components are required to be masked by tapes. We propose a fast and intuitive telemanipulation-based method to teach a robot these masking skills and compare the performance of the proposed method with teach pendant&#x2013;based methods among several users. This study aims to prove the efficiency and intuitiveness of the telemanipulation-based method proposed herein for enabling a robot to learn skillful and complex manipulation tasks.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>It is notable that localization accuracy using received signal strength (RSS) fingerprints solely is very vulnerable to dynamic environments. Utilizing multiple fingerprints gleaned from RSS for localization is a propitious strategy to overcome the RSS susceptibility. Brimful utilization via fusing multiple fingerprint functions which supplement each other are not harnessed by existing fusion-based techniques, resulting in low localization accuracy. This paper presents a novel and robust WiFi localization modus operandi by fusing DerIvative Fingerprints of RSS with MultIple Classifiers (DIFMIC). DIFMIC first constructs a multiple fingerprints group by gleaning hyperbolic location fingerprint (HLF) and signal strength differences fingerprint (DIFF) from RSS fingerprints. Then, it obtains Multiple Fingerprints Trained Classifiers (MFTCs) via training each basic classifier with each fingerprint. To fully leverage the inherent supplementation among fingerprints and classifiers, a two-layer fusion profile (weights) joint optimization algorithm with multiple constraints is proposed. We also propose a Fusion Profile Selection (FPS) algorithm to intelligently choose fusion weights from the two-layer fusion profile for a more accurate localization. DIFMIC shows more leverage in combining multiple information, thus exhibiting better robustness in WiFi positioning. Results from our experiments reflect that DIFMIC performs better than other existing methods in real environments.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Individually reinforcing the robustness of a single deep learning model only gives limited security guarantees especially when facing adversarial examples. In this article, we propose DeSVig, a decentralized swift vigilance framework to identify adversarial attacks in an industrial artificial intelligence systems (IAISs), which enables IAISs to correct the mistake in a few seconds. The DeSVig is highly decentralized, which improves the effectiveness of recognizing abnormal inputs. We try to overcome the challenges on ultralow latency caused by dynamics in industries using peculiarly designated mobile edge computing and generative adversarial networks. The most important advantage of our work is that it can significantly reduce the failure risks of being deceived by adversarial examples, which is critical for safety-prioritized and delay-sensitive environments. In our experiments, adversarial examples of industrial electronic components are generated by several classical attacking models. Experimental results demonstrate that the DeSVig is more robust, efficient, and scalable than some state-of-art defenses.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This article proposes a charging management of electric vehicles (EVs) with a newly presented EV social contribution. The EV charging problem is represented by a generalized Nash equilibrium game where each individual EV tries to minimize its charging cost while satisfying its own charging requirements and respecting the charging facility constraints. The individual EV features a social behavior to potentially contribute in shifting its charging schedule from specific intervals that have insufficient charging power. This shift in the EV schedule will allow more charging power to other EVs that admit stricter charging requirements, i.e., intervals and demands. In this way, the contributed EVs socially help others in reducing their charging costs, which is particularly important during the overload cases in the system. The proposed solution is reached iteratively in a distributed way utilizing the consensus network and found based on the receding horizon optimization framework. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed social contribution in the charging management for reducing the charging cost of EVs.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Energy storage units (such as battery or ultracapacitor) can help to reduce the power fluctuation in the impedance source network converter applications such as the photovoltaic (PV) and fuel cells systems. Due to the unknown dynamic characteristics of the energy stored impedance network, the unexpected oscillation and inrush currents in dynamic process might threaten the storage device safety. In this article, an energy stored quasi-Z-source converter with the battery is modeled and analyzed including the transient capacitor current. The impact of the network internal resonance on the battery current control loop is mathematically explored. The resulted conflict between the zero steady-state error and bandwidth requirement is revealed. That yields the sacrifice and limitation of the closed-loop dynamic performance in the conventional methods. An active damping technique is then proposed to ensure the extended bandwidth and better dynamic performances under different state of charge (SOC) occasions. The theoretical analysis and performance are both verified by the simulations and experiments.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Current flow controllers (CFCs) are power electronics-based devices that may remove some technical barriers preventing multiterminal high-voltage direct current (MTdc) grid deployment. In this paper, an interline CFC topology is investigated. The single H-bridge CFC (1B-CFC) alters the grid power flow by transferring power between neighboring dc lines. The operation and control of a 1B-CFC under a single modulation scheme is presented. A control strategy has been proposed to provide pole balancing support during imbalance conditions. Small-scale prototypes have been developed to demonstrate the functionality and operational range of the device. To this end, an experimental MTdc grid test-rig has been employed. It is shown that a 1B-CFC could be used to limit the dc line current and, additionally, it can be employed to enable asymmetrical tapping of dc lines. For completeness, the performance of the device has been experimentally validated under line overloading, pole imbalance conditions, and a pole-to-pole dc fault.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper introduces the bridgeless triple-mode resonant ac&#x2013;dc converter and presents its dynamic model and control technique. The proposed converter operates in triple mode: discontinuous-conduction mode (DCM), continuous-conduction mode (CCM), and missing resonance mode (MRM). It has the advantages of small number of required components, medium power capacity, and high efficiency, but it is difficult to control because DCM, CCM, and MRM have their own dynamic characteristics. To solve this control problem, the mode boundaries are first identified and, corresponding to each mode, the dynamic model is developed to design the controller. In each mode, we propose to add a repetitive controller (RC) with a phase-lead compensator to the conventional duty ratio plus feedback controller. The RC is used to suppress the deterministic periodic disturbances and the phase-lead compensator is used to compensate for the incurred phase lag. A 1-kW digitally controlled converter prototype is built and used to demonstrate the validity of the proposed modeling and control approach.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This article presents a sequential fusion approach for state estimation of networked multisensor nonlinear systems, where sensors and estimators are allowed to work asynchronously. Both sequential measurement fusion (SMF) and sequential state fusion (SSF) estimators are designed, where the unscented filtering method is used in the design of the local SMF estimator, and the matrix weighting method is applied in the design of the SSF estimator. It is shown that the proposed SSF estimators provide a satisfactory estimation precision that is close to the centralized batch state fusion (BSF) estimator, while requiring smaller computation burden as compared with the BSF estimator. Both simulations and experiments of a moving target tracking system are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed sequential fusion methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fault diagnosis, which identifies the root cause of the observed out-of-control status, is essential to counteracting or eliminating faults in industrial processes. Many conventional data-driven fault diagnosis methods ignore the fault tendency of abnormal samples, and they need a complete retraining process to include the newly collected abnormal samples or fault classes. In this article, a broad convolutional neural network (BCNN) is designed with incremental learning capability for solving the aforementioned issues. The proposed method combines several consecutive samples as a data matrix, and it then extracts both fault tendency and nonlinear structure from the obtained data matrix by using convolutional operation. After that, the weights in fully connected layers can be trained based on the obtained features and their corresponding fault labels. Because of the architecture of this network, the diagnosis performance of the BCNN model can be improved by adding newly generated additional features. Finally, the incremental learning capability of the proposed method is also designed, so that the BCNN model can update itself to include new coming abnormal samples and fault classes. The proposed method is applied both to a simulated process and a real industrial process. Experimental results illustrate that it can better capture the characteristics of the fault process, and effectively update diagnosis model to include new coming abnormal samples, and fault classes.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>People constantly share their photographs with others through various social media sites. With the aid of the privacy settings provided by social media sites, image owners can designate scope of sharing, e.g., close friends and acquaintances. However, even if the owner of a photograph carefully sets the privacy setting to exclude a given individual who is not supposed to see the photograph, the photograph may still eventually reach a wider audience, including those clearly undesired through unanticipated channels of disclosure, causing a privacy breach. Moreover, it is often the case that a given image involves multiple stakeholders who are also depicted in the photograph. Due to various personalities, it is even more challenging to reach agreement on the privacy settings for these multi-owner photographs. In this paper, we propose a privacy risk reminder system, called REMIND, which estimates the probability that a shared photograph may be seen by unwanted people-through the social graph-who are not included in the original sharing list. We tackle this problem from a novel angle by digging into the big data regarding image sharing history. Specifically, the social media providers possess a huge amount of image sharing information (e.g., what photographs are shared with whom) of their users. By analyzing and modeling such rich information, we build a sophisticated probability model that efficiently aggregates the image disclosure probabilities along different possible image propagation chains and loops. If the computed disclosure probability indicates high risks of privacy breach, a reminder is issued to the image owner to help revise the privacy settings (or, at least, inform the user about this accidental disclosure risk). The proposed REMIND system also has a nice feature of policy harmonization that helps resolve privacy differences in multi-owner photographs. We have carried out a user study to validate the rationale of our proposed solutions and also conducte-
 experimental studies to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed REMIND system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The side-channel leakage is a consequence of program execution in a computer processor, and understanding relationship between code execution and information leakage is a necessary step in estimating information leakage and its capacity limits. This paper proposes a methodology to relate program execution to electromagnetic side-channel emanations and estimates side-channel information capacity created by execution of series of instructions (e.g., a function, a procedure, or a program) in a processor. To model dependence among program instructions in a code, we propose to use Markov source model, which includes the dependencies among sequence of instructions as well as dependencies among instructions as they pass through a pipeline of the processor. The emitted electromagnetic (EM) signals during instruction executions are natural choice for the inputs into the model. To obtain the channel inputs for the proposed model, we derive a mathematical relationship between the emanated instruction signal power (ESP) and total emanated signal power while running a program. Then, we derive the leakage capacity of EM side channels created by execution of series of instructions in a processor. Finally, we provide experimental results to demonstrate that leakages could be severe and that a dedicated attacker could obtain important information.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Online romance scams are a prevalent form of mass-marketing fraud in the West, and yet few studies have presented data-driven responses to this problem. In this type of scam, fraudsters craft fake profiles and manually interact with their victims. Because of the characteristics of this type of fraud and how dating sites operate, traditional detection methods (e.g., those used in spam filtering) are ineffective. In this paper, we investigate the archetype of online dating profiles used in this form of fraud, including their use of demographics, profile descriptions, and images, shedding light on both the strategies deployed by scammers to appeal to victims and the traits of victims themselves. Furthermore, in response to the severe financial and psychological harm caused by dating fraud, we develop a system to detect romance scammers on online dating platforms. This paper presents the first fully described system for automatically detecting this fraud. Our aim is to provide an early detection system to stop romance scammers as they create fraudulent profiles or before they engage with potential victims. Previous research has indicated that the victims of romance scams score highly on scales for idealized romantic beliefs. We combine a range of structured, unstructured, and deep-learned features that capture these beliefs in order to build a detection system. Our ensemble machine-learning approach is robust to the omission of profile details and performs at high accuracy (97%) in a hold-out validation set. The system enables development of automated tools for dating site providers and individual users.

<p>This study presents a deep neural network architecture that achieves state of the art multi-session verification and identification performance for Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission (TEOAE) biometric system. TEOAE is a 20ms long response generated by the ear that is naturally strong against falsification, and replay attacks. It can be measured using a device with a speaker and multiple microphones. Previous TEAOE authentication methods focused on single-session or mixed-session performance. Our method focuses on multi-session authentication performance. We train a neural network model that generates a TEOAE embedding that is separable in Euclidean space by using the triplet loss function. These embeddings are used to create identity templates which are used to authenticate the user. We achieved identification accuracy of 99.3 &#x00b1; 1.04&#x0025;, and achieved an EER(Equal Error Rate) of 0.187 &#x00b1; 0.146&#x0025; for verification scenarios. Our method has achieved 7.56&#x0025; performance increase for identification scenarios and 13.3&#x0025; performance increase for verification scenarios over previous methods when averaged across all tests.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In recent years there has been an increasing interest in sensing devices that capture multidimensional information such as the spectral light field (SLF) images, which are 5-dimensional (5D) representations of a scene including 2D spatial, 2D angular and 1D spectral information. Spatio-spectral and angular information plays an important role in modern applications spanning from microscopy to computer vision. However, SLF sensors use expensive beam-splitters or cameras arrays placed in tandem, which split the sensing problem in two time consuming and independent tasks: spectral and light field imaging tasks. This work proposes a compressive spectral light field imaging architecture that builds on the principles of the compressive imaging framework, to capture multiplexed representations of the multidimensional information, so that, less measurements are required to capture the SLF data cube. Alongside, we propose a computational algorithm to recover the 5D information from the compressed measurements, exploiting the inherent high correlations within the SLF by treating them as 3D tensors. Furthermore, exploiting the geometry properties of the proposed optical architecture, the Tucker decomposition is applied to the set of compressed measurements, so that, an ad-hoc dictionary-like image representation basis is calculated online. This in turn, entails a more accurate reconstruction of the SLF since the dictionary fits the specific characteristics of the image itself. We demonstrate through simulations over three SLF datasets captured in our laboratory, and an experimental proof-of-concept implementation, that the proposed compressive imaging device together with the proposed computational algorithm represent an efficient alternative to capture SLF, compared to conventional methods that employ either side-information or multiple sensors. Also, we show that the tensor-based proposed algorithm exhibits a lower computational complexity than the matrix-based state of the -
rt counterparts, thus enabling fast processing of multidimensional images.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Benefiting from the quick development of deep convolutional neural networks, especially fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), remarkable progresses have been achieved on salient object detection recently. Nevertheless, these FCNs based methods are still challenging to generate high resolution saliency maps, and also not applicable for subsequent applications due to their heavy model weights. In this paper, we propose a compact and efficient deep network with high accuracy for salient object detection. Firstly, we propose two strategies for initial prediction, one is a new designed multi-scale context module, the other is incorporating hand-crafted saliency priors. Secondly, we employ residual learning to refine it progressively by only learning the residual in each side-output, which can be achieved with few convolutional parameters, therefore leads to high compactness and high efficiency. Finally, we further design a novel top-down reverse attention block to guide the above side-output residual learning. Specifically, the current predicted salient regions are used to erase its side-output feature, thus the missing object parts and details can be efficiently learned from these unerased regions, which results in more complete detection and high accuracy. Extensive experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed network performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches, and shows advantages in simplicity, compactness and efficiency.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Seismic image interpolation is a currently popular research subject in modern reflection seismology. The interpolation problem is generally treated as a process of inversion. Under the compressed sensing framework, various sparse transformations and low-rank constraints based methods have great performances in recovering irregularly missing traces. However, in the case of regularly missing traces, their applications are limited because of the strong spatial aliasing energies. In addition, the erratic noise always poses a serious impact on the interpolation results obtained by the sparse transformations and low-rank constraints-based methods,. This is because the erratic noise is far from satisfying the statistical assumption behind these methods. In this study, we propose a mathematical morphology-based interpolation technique, which constrains the morphological scale of the model in the inversion process. The inversion problem is solved by the shaping regularization approach. The mathematical morphological constraint (MMC)-based interpolation technique has a satisfactory robustness to the spatial aliasing and erratic energies. We provide a detailed algorithmic framework and discuss the extension from 2D to higher dimensional version and the back operator in the shaping inversion. A group of numerical examples demonstrates the successful performance of the proposed technique.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The human visual system tends to consider saliency of an object as a whole. Some object-level saliency detection methods have been proposed by leveraging object proposals in bounding boxes, and regarding the entire bounding box as one candidate salient region. However, the bounding boxes can not provide exact object position and a lot of pixels in bounding boxes belong to the background. Consequently, background pixels in bounding box also show high saliency. Besides, acquiring object proposals needs high time cost. In order to compute object-level saliency, we consider region growing from some seed superpixels, to find one surrounding region which probably represents the whole object. The desired surrounding region has similar appearance inside and obvious difference with the outside, which is proposed as maximally stable region (MSR) in this paper. In addition, one effective seed superpixel selection strategy is presented to improve speed. MSR based saliency detection is more robust than pixel or superpixel level methods and object proposal based methods. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods at 50 FPS. Compared with deep learning based methods, we show worse performance, but with about 1200-1600 times faster, which means better trade-off between performance and speed.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we develop a concise but efficient network architecture called linear compressing based skip-connecting network (LCSCNet) for image super-resolution. Compared with two representative network architectures with skip connections, ResNet and DenseNet, a linear compressing layer is designed in LCSCNet for skip connection, which connects former feature maps and distinguishes them from newly-explored feature maps. In this way, the proposed LCSCNet enjoys the merits of the distinguish feature treatment of DenseNet and the parameter-economic form of ResNet. Moreover, to better exploit hierarchical information from both low and high levels of various receptive fields in deep models, inspired by gate units in LSTM, we also propose an adaptive element-wise fusion strategy with multi-supervised training. Experimental results in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms validate the effectiveness of LCSCNet.
