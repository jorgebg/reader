<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Substantial difficulties in adopting cloud services are often encountered
during upgrades of existing software systems. A reliable early stage analysis
can facilitate an informed decision process of moving systems to cloud
platforms. It can also mitigate risks against system quality goals. Towards
this, we propose an interactive goal reasoning approach which is supported by a
probabilistic layer for the precise analysis of cloud migration risks to
improve the reliability of risk control. The approach is illustrated using a
commercial scenario of integrating a digital document processing system to
Microsoft Azure cloud platform.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Cloud computing services has become the de facto standard technique for
training neural network. However, the computing resources of the cloud servers
are limited by hardware and the fixed algorithms of service provider. We
observe that this problem can be addressed by a distributed machine learning
system, which can utilize the idle devices on the Internet. We further
demonstrate that such system can improve the computing flexibility by providing
diverse algorithm. For the purpose of the data encryption in the distributed
system, we propose Tripartite Asymmetric Encryption theorem and give a
mathematical proof. Based on the theorem, we design a universal image
encryption model ArchNet. The model has been implemented on MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST and Cifar-10 datasets. We use different base models on the
encrypted datasets and contrast the results with RC4 algorithm and Difference
Privacy policy. The accuracies on the datasets encrypted by ArchNet are
97.26\%, 84.15\% and 79.80\%, and they are 97.31\%, 82.31\% and 80.22\% on the
original datasets. Our evaluations show that ArchNet significantly outperforms
RC4 on 3 classic image classification datasets at the recognition accuracy and
our encrypted dataset sometimes outperforms than the original dataset and the
difference privacy policy.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Organisations disclose their privacy practices by posting privacy policies on
their website. Even though users often care about their digital privacy, they
often don't read privacy policies since they require a significant investment
in time and effort. Although natural language processing can help in privacy
policy understanding, there has been a lack of large scale privacy policy
corpora that could be used to analyse, understand, and simplify privacy
policies. Thus, we create PrivaSeer, a corpus of over one million English
language website privacy policies, which is significantly larger than any
previously available corpus. We design a corpus creation pipeline which
consists of crawling the web followed by filtering documents using language
detection, document classification, duplicate and near-duplication removal, and
content extraction. We investigate the composition of the corpus and show
results from readability tests, document similarity, keyphrase extraction, and
explored the corpus through topic modeling.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Research in adversarial machine learning has shown how the performance of
machine learning models can be seriously compromised by injecting even a small
fraction of poisoning points into the training data. While the effects on model
accuracy of such poisoning attacks have been widely studied, their potential
effects on other model performance metrics remain to be evaluated. In this
work, we introduce an optimization framework for poisoning attacks against
algorithmic fairness, and develop a gradient-based poisoning attack aimed at
introducing classification disparities among different groups in the data. We
empirically show that our attack is effective not only in the white-box
setting, in which the attacker has full access to the target model, but also in
a more challenging black-box scenario in which the attacks are optimized
against a substitute model and then transferred to the target model. We believe
that our findings pave the way towards the definition of an entirely novel set
of adversarial attacks targeting algorithmic fairness in different scenarios,
and that investigating such vulnerabilities will help design more robust
algorithms and countermeasures in the future.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The authentication field is evolving towards mechanisms able to keep users
continuously authenticated without the necessity of remembering or possessing
authentication credentials. While existing continuous authentication systems
have demonstrated their suitability for single-device scenarios, the Internet
of Things and next generation of mobile networks (5G) are enabling novel
multi-device scenarios -- such as Smart Offices -- where continuous
authentication is still an open challenge. The paper at hand, proposes an
AI-based, privacy-preserving and multi-device continuous authentication
architecture called AuthCODE. A realistic Smart Office scenario with several
users, interacting with their mobile devices and personal computer, has been
used to create a set of single- and multi-device behavioural datasets and
validate AuthCODE. A pool of experiments with machine and deep learning
classifiers measured the impact of time in authentication accuracy and improved
the results of single-device approaches by considering multi-device behaviour
profiles. The f1-score average reached for XGBoost on multi-device profiles
based on 1-minute windows was 99.33%, while the best performance achieved for
single devices was lower than 97.39%. The inclusion of temporal information in
the form of vector sequences classified by a Long-Short Term Memory Network,
allowed the identification of additional complex behaviour patterns associated
to each user, resulting in an average f1-score of 99.02% on identification of
long-term behaviours.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Privacy concerns on smartphones have been raised by the public as more and more personal data are now stored on them. In this paper, we show that location information can be compromised through mobile inertial sensors which are considered insensitive and accessible by any mobile application in both iOS and Android without special privilege. We present MISSILE, an automatic system that can infer users&#x2019; indoor location using labeled sensor data as prior knowledge. The key idea is that when a user reaches a particular indoor location, it is very likely that he/she has passed through some unique interior structures of a building, such as winding corridors, fire stop doors or elevators. These structures exhibit repeatable motion and environment patterns in mobile sensors that can be recognized by supervised learning. In our MISSILE system, the location labels of training data are automatically attained by Bluetooth beacons deployed in sensitive locations. With effective feature extraction procedure robust modeling, MISSILE shows good success rate for inference attack. For example, in a university campus with 15 sensitive locations, MISSILE achieves up to 73&#x0025; correct prediction score whereas a random guess can only achieve 1/(15 &#x002b; 1) &#x003d; 6.25&#x0025;. Further improvements on system performance and countermeasures are also discussed.

<p>Susanne Hellmuth and Olaf Stemmann from the University of Bayreuth have discovered a natural protective mechanism that leads to the programmed death of potentially diseased cells. It protects from cancer that can develop as a result of irregular distribution of genetic information to daughter cells. The enzyme separase plays a central role in these processes. The findings published in "Nature" offer promising approaches for cancer therapy.

<p>Long-lasting insecticide nets (LLINs) have had a large role in the reduction of malaria incidence in the endemic countries in sub-Saharan Africa. However, pyrethroid resistance is now widespread and threatens to not only render LLINs irrelevant, but also to reverse the gains made towards malaria elimination. The concern about resistance has prompted a suggestion that insecticides should be removed from LLINs to preserve them for other use in vector control measures.1

<p>In response to the global challenge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), many countries have launched priority initiatives. The UK established a national action plan against AMR in 2000, followed by the USA and Germany in 2015.1&#8211;3 A crucial development in these initiatives, as well as AMR strategies in most Nordic and some southern EU countries such as Spain,4 is a focus on a One Health perspective that includes priorities such as developing prevention strategies, breaking transmission chains, enhancing surveillance, improving treatment and diagnostics, and raising awareness nationally and internationally.

<p>It was the news from Wuhan, China, in the first days of 2020 that made Sarah Gilbert sit up and think. As Professor of Vaccinology at the University of Oxford in the UK, and a leading scientist at the university's Jenner Institute, her research team wasted no time in getting involved. &#8220;We had recently started thinking about an appropriate response to Disease X; how could we mobilise and focus our resources to go more quickly than we had ever gone before. And then Disease X arrived&#8221;, she says. Once the genome sequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became available in mid-January, Gilbert's team set to work to design a vaccine, using recombinant DNA techniques to create a SARS-CoV-2 antigen and embedding it within a primate adenovirus vector.

<p>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) refers to the integrative system consisting of interconnected computing and control devices interacting with the physical infrastructure via sensors and actuators. Recently, there is a swift growth of CPSs ranging from smart grids to smart buildings, robotics, and other industrial control systems. They have formed the keystone of the sustainable growth of the economy, manufacturing, and smart and connected communities. Due to extensive applications of CPSs, their resilience, reliability, and security are paramount. Many factors, however, pose significant threats to CPSs and lead to high economic losses and social impacts. Software defects also make CPSs vulnerable to security attacks and coordinated cyber and physical attacks. To address this issue, emerging technologies and methods for understanding and improving the resilience, reliability, and security of CPSs are needed. This Special Section aims to provide a platform to help define, understand, and quantify the resilience, reliability, and security of CPSs.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We present the physical-layer maximum a posteriori (MAP) test for detecting false data in multiple-source wireless relay networks. The MAP test, which minimizes the average probability of detection error, exploits the noisy (erroneous) information about the true packet that the destination receives (overhears) directly from the source nodes as a reference. We show that the average probability of detection error decreases exponentially as the number of source nodes increases, regardless of the reliability of the reference information. This indicates that the multiplicity of source nodes can be leveraged to construct a powerful integrity check mechanism for detecting false data at the destination. We also present a parallel MAP test that improves the detection accuracy when the number of source nodes is limited and overhearing channel disparities are high. Then, we present a packet recovery mechanism to recover false alarmed packets, i.e. unmodified packets that are mistakenly declared as modified, by the MAP test and thereby to improve the throughput.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, a decentralized energy management strategy (EMS), which is derived from the conventional droop control, is proposed for the auxiliary power unit composed of multiple fuel cells (FCs) and supercapacitors (SCs) of a more electric aircraft. By utilizing a virtual inductor droop scheme to the FC converter and a virtual resistor droop scheme to the SC converter, the proposed EMS is able to split the load power automatically into low and high frequency components and allocate them to the FC and SC units, respectively. In addition, by optimally designing the droop parameters, accurate power sharing among different source units is achieved. The proposed strategy is not only suitable for extending the service life of the system by adding State of Charge (SoC) protection mechanism in the energy management, but also can improve the system reliability as it is compatible for the disconnection of some source units when fault occurs. The operational principle of the proposed EMS and the detailed system design methodology are elaborated, followed by which hardware-in-the-loop simulation study based on Typhoon HIL 602 is done to verify its validity.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To effectively capture interactions of large-scale ac&#x2013;dc systems integrating line commutated converter (LCC) and modular multilevel converter (MMC) based multiterminal dc grids, a numerically accurate and efficient simulation method is desirable. To achieve this objective, a cosimulation method is proposed in this article, where the target system is decoupled into the shifted-frequency phasor (SFP) subsystem, the dynamic phasor (DP) subsystem, and electromagnetic transient (EMT) subsystem, respectively. The MMCs are included in the SFP subsystem and implemented on massively paralleled graphics processing units (GPUs). Thus, the simulation efficiency is greatly improved by adopting a much larger time step, the model order reduction technique, and GPU acceleration. The LCCs are represented by DPs and are included in the DP subsystem. The majority of ac grids are covered in the EMT subsystem. Further, the interactions between SFP and EMT subsystems are reflected by the proposed multidomain transmission line model, which can produce instantaneous and phasor values simultaneously. The interface model between DP and EMT subsystems is modeled as a special controlled voltage and current circuit. Finally, the overall cosimulation method is realized by the respective SFP/DP and EMT models, among which their interactions are reflected by the proposed interface models and the time sequences of simulations. The performance of the proposed method has been fully validated on a practical large-scale ac&#x2013;dc system.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This article introduces a rotary semiactive variable stiffness (VS) device, including its system design and model validation. A variable damping (VD) device and springs can form mechanical networks with specific topologies, and the VD device can control the equivalent stiffness of the network by varying its damping. The proposed rotary electromagnetic VS device consists of an electromagnetic VD device and a torsion spring, which are in series, while a planetary gear reducer is used to amplify the torque output of the VS device. The models of the electromagnetic VD and VS devices are both built and validated with tests. Then, a seat suspension applies the VS device by installing the device in the center of its scissors structure. Bump and random vibration experiments are implemented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed VS system for seat suspension vibration control. The new system has merits in controllability and energy efficiency. It is easier to design the controller than the conventional one with magnetorheological damper due to the linear damping of the electromagnetic VD device. Besides, the system energy consumption is low and has energy harvesting capability. The proposed semiactive electromagnetic VS device also has potential in other practical applicationss.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The quality assessment of the sound power generated by refrigeration compressors is an important and costly process for manufacturers, mainly due to the need for acoustic rooms. Hence, very few samples per lot are tested. In this article, an alternative method based on soft sensing is proposed to estimate the sound power of refrigeration compressors. The method uses vibration measurements from the compressor surface as the input and the sound power generated as the output of machine learning (ML) models to create data-driven soft sensors. This method is less restrictive than the traditional ones and allows a test to be done close to the manufacturing line, in a much faster and cheaper way. In order to create the dataset to train the ML models, sound power and vibration levels of compressors were measured simultaneously in a reverberation room. The results from the data-driven soft sensors were compared with the ones obtained using a simple analytic model defined in an ISO technical note and showed that, even with as little as one vibration measurement point, the proposed method presented better results than the ISO analytic model with nine measurement points.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The problem of inefficient and unevenly distributed spectrum usage in industrial wireless networks has led to the emergence of the concept of industrial cognitive radio (CR) networks, which have particularly important applications in automotive industry. Industrial CR networks are planned to function in a wide spectrum range; therefore, they have high energy consumption because of frequency switching while other wireless technologies do not have this problem. A distinctive feature of this switching cost is that it depends on the wideness between the two frequency bands. In this article, we formulate the joint frequency assignment and scheduling problem for multihop industrial CR networks with a single transceiver by considering varying amounts of energy consumption that occurs while CR devices switch to different frequency bands. Our optimization problem, which we formulate as an integer linear program, minimizes the energy cost related to frequency switching while making frequency and time slot allocation to the cognitive devices. We prove that even on star graphs, our formulated problem is inapproximable within any polynomial-time computable function $f(n)$ in addition to being $textsc {NP}text {-Hard}$ in the strong sense. Therefore, we propose a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm to solve the energy consumption problem due to channel switching. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of our heuristic algorithm is very close to the results obtained from the integer linear programming implementation by CPLEX optimization software. We also compare our proposed method with the corresponding constant energy consumption for frequency switching case and two state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrate that taking into account the different energy consumption while switching to different frequency bands -
s vital for joint frequency assignment and scheduling in multihop industrial CR networks with a single transceiver.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Poor signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and low spatial resolutions have impeded low-cost pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensors from many intelligent applications for thermal target detection/recognition. This article presents a cognitive signal conditioning and modulation learning framework for PIR sensing with the following two innovations to solve these problems: 1) a reconfigurable signal conditioning circuit design to achieve high SNRs and 2) an optimal sensor mask design to achieve high recognition performance. By using a programmable system on chip, the PIR signal amplifier gain and filter bandwidth can be adjusted automatically according to working conditions. Based on the modeling between PIR physics and thermal images, sensor masks can be optimized through training convolution neural networks with large thermal image datasets for feature extraction of specific thermal targets. The experimental results verify the improved performance of PIR sensors in various working conditions and applications by using the developed reconfigurable circuit and application-specific masks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, we investigate code-oriented partitioning computation offloading strategy for multiple user equipments (UEs) and multiple mobile edge computing servers with limited resources (i.e., limited computing power and waiting task queues with finite capacity). This article aims to develop an offloading strategy to decide the execution location, CPU frequency, and transmission power for UE while minimizing the execution overhead (i.e., a weighted sum of energy consumption and computational time) of UE&#x0027;s applications, which is an NP-hard problem. To achieve the objective, first, we transform the problem into a convex optimization problem and find the optimal solution. Second, we propose a decentralized computation offloading strategy (DCOS) algorithm for UE, and define a dictionary data structure for recording the strategy of the UE to reduce the algorithm complexity. Finally, the effectiveness of DCOS, and the impact of various key parameters on the strategy and overhead are demonstrated by simulation experiments.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, we consider the security problem for the consensus-based distributed state estimation. To resist the malicious attacker who can falsify the data transmitted through the wireless channel, each node equips with an attack defender, which is based on the measurement of its built-in sensor. Under the stealthy attack, which can deceive the defender, we investigate the resilience and convergence of the distributed estimation in two different attack scenarios. For the attack with enough communication resources, we provide a sufficient condition of the optimal attack to quantify the maximum estimation performance degradation. We also analyze the resilience of the worst case distributed estimation caused by the attacker. For the attack with limited resources, the optimal Kalman gain for each node is derived to maximize its estimation performance under the attack. We also give a sufficient condition to guarantee the convergence of the distributed estimation in this case. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effect of the defender on guaranteeing the resilience of sensor networks against attacks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep learning methods for image quality assessment (IQA) are limited due to the small size of existing datasets. Extensive datasets require substantial resources both for generating publishable content and annotating it accurately. We present a systematic and scalable approach to creating KonIQ-10k, the largest IQA dataset to date, consisting of 10,073 quality scored images. It is the first in-the-wild database aiming for ecological validity, concerning the authenticity of distortions, the diversity of content, and quality-related indicators. Through the use of crowdsourcing, we obtained 1.2 million reliable quality ratings from 1,459 crowd workers, paving the way for more general IQA models. We propose a novel, deep learning model (KonCept512), to show an excellent generalization beyond the test set (0.921 SROCC), to the current state-of-the-art database LIVE-in-the-Wild (0.825 SROCC). The model derives its core performance from the InceptionResNet architecture, being trained at a higher resolution than previous models (512 &#x00d7; 384 ). Correlation analysis shows that KonCept512 performs similar to having 9 subjective scores for each test image.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The side-channel leakage is a consequence of program execution in a computer processor, and understanding relationship between code execution and information leakage is a necessary step in estimating information leakage and its capacity limits. This paper proposes a methodology to relate program execution to electromagnetic side-channel emanations and estimates side-channel information capacity created by execution of series of instructions (e.g., a function, a procedure, or a program) in a processor. To model dependence among program instructions in a code, we propose to use Markov source model, which includes the dependencies among sequence of instructions as well as dependencies among instructions as they pass through a pipeline of the processor. The emitted electromagnetic (EM) signals during instruction executions are natural choice for the inputs into the model. To obtain the channel inputs for the proposed model, we derive a mathematical relationship between the emanated instruction signal power (ESP) and total emanated signal power while running a program. Then, we derive the leakage capacity of EM side channels created by execution of series of instructions in a processor. Finally, we provide experimental results to demonstrate that leakages could be severe and that a dedicated attacker could obtain important information.

<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

<p>Online romance scams are a prevalent form of mass-marketing fraud in the West, and yet few studies have presented data-driven responses to this problem. In this type of scam, fraudsters craft fake profiles and manually interact with their victims. Because of the characteristics of this type of fraud and how dating sites operate, traditional detection methods (e.g., those used in spam filtering) are ineffective. In this paper, we investigate the archetype of online dating profiles used in this form of fraud, including their use of demographics, profile descriptions, and images, shedding light on both the strategies deployed by scammers to appeal to victims and the traits of victims themselves. Furthermore, in response to the severe financial and psychological harm caused by dating fraud, we develop a system to detect romance scammers on online dating platforms. This paper presents the first fully described system for automatically detecting this fraud. Our aim is to provide an early detection system to stop romance scammers as they create fraudulent profiles or before they engage with potential victims. Previous research has indicated that the victims of romance scams score highly on scales for idealized romantic beliefs. We combine a range of structured, unstructured, and deep-learned features that capture these beliefs in order to build a detection system. Our ensemble machine-learning approach is robust to the omission of profile details and performs at high accuracy (97%) in a hold-out validation set. The system enables development of automated tools for dating site providers and individual users.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Benefiting from the quick development of deep convolutional neural networks, especially fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), remarkable progresses have been achieved on salient object detection recently. Nevertheless, these FCNs based methods are still challenging to generate high resolution saliency maps, and also not applicable for subsequent applications due to their heavy model weights. In this paper, we propose a compact and efficient deep network with high accuracy for salient object detection. Firstly, we propose two strategies for initial prediction, one is a new designed multi-scale context module, the other is incorporating hand-crafted saliency priors. Secondly, we employ residual learning to refine it progressively by only learning the residual in each side-output, which can be achieved with few convolutional parameters, therefore leads to high compactness and high efficiency. Finally, we further design a novel top-down reverse attention block to guide the above side-output residual learning. Specifically, the current predicted salient regions are used to erase its side-output feature, thus the missing object parts and details can be efficiently learned from these unerased regions, which results in more complete detection and high accuracy. Extensive experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed network performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches, and shows advantages in simplicity, compactness and efficiency.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Seismic image interpolation is a currently popular research subject in modern reflection seismology. The interpolation problem is generally treated as a process of inversion. Under the compressed sensing framework, various sparse transformations and low-rank constraints based methods have great performances in recovering irregularly missing traces. However, in the case of regularly missing traces, their applications are limited because of the strong spatial aliasing energies. In addition, the erratic noise always poses a serious impact on the interpolation results obtained by the sparse transformations and low-rank constraints-based methods,. This is because the erratic noise is far from satisfying the statistical assumption behind these methods. In this study, we propose a mathematical morphology-based interpolation technique, which constrains the morphological scale of the model in the inversion process. The inversion problem is solved by the shaping regularization approach. The mathematical morphological constraint (MMC)-based interpolation technique has a satisfactory robustness to the spatial aliasing and erratic energies. We provide a detailed algorithmic framework and discuss the extension from 2D to higher dimensional version and the back operator in the shaping inversion. A group of numerical examples demonstrates the successful performance of the proposed technique.

<p>The human visual system tends to consider saliency of an object as a whole. Some object-level saliency detection methods have been proposed by leveraging object proposals in bounding boxes, and regarding the entire bounding box as one candidate salient region. However, the bounding boxes can not provide exact object position and a lot of pixels in bounding boxes belong to the background. Consequently, background pixels in bounding box also show high saliency. Besides, acquiring object proposals needs high time cost. In order to compute object-level saliency, we consider region growing from some seed superpixels, to find one surrounding region which probably represents the whole object. The desired surrounding region has similar appearance inside and obvious difference with the outside, which is proposed as maximally stable region (MSR) in this paper. In addition, one effective seed superpixel selection strategy is presented to improve speed. MSR based saliency detection is more robust than pixel or superpixel level methods and object proposal based methods. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods at 50 FPS. Compared with deep learning based methods, we show worse performance, but with about 1200-1600 times faster, which means better trade-off between performance and speed.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Super-resolution phase retrieval is an inverse problem that appears in diffractive optical imaging (DOI) and consists in estimating a high-resolution image from low-resolution phaseless measurements. DOI has three diffraction zones where the data can be acquired, known as near, middle, and far fields. Recent works have studied super-resolution phase retrieval under a setup that records coded diffraction patterns at the near and far fields. However, the attainable resolution of the image is mainly governed by the sensor characteristics, whose cost increases in proportion to the resolution. Also, these methodologies lack theoretical analysis. Hence, this work derives super-resolution models from low-resolution coded phaseless measurements at any diffraction zone that in contrast to prior contributions, the attainable resolution of the image is determined by the resolution of the coded aperture. For the proposed models, the existence of a unique solution (up to a global unimodular constant) is guaranteed with high probability, which can be increased by designing the coded aperture. Therefore, a strategy that designs the spatial distribution of the coded aperture is developed. Additionally, a super-resolution phase retrieval algorithm that minimizes a smoothed nonconvex least-squares objective function is proposed. The method first approximates the image by a spectral algorithm, which is then refined based upon a sequence of alternate steps. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm overcomes state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing the high-resolution image. In addition, the reconstruction quality using designed coded apertures is higher than that of the non-designed ensembles.
