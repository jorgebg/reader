<p>Within the health sector, women account for more than 67% of the workforce, making them indispensable as contributors to the delivery of health-care services.1 However, women's roles as health-care providers are concentrated in lower-level occupations and are poorly represented in management positions and at senior levels. In global health, one possible explanation for this low representation in senior roles is that women often have less time to devote to extensive travel responsibilities for work in the field because they serve as primary caregivers.

Further study of pegbelfermin is warranted in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Additional studies that use liver biopsies would allow for the assessment of pegbelfermin's effects on liver histology. Moreover, further studies should allow assessments of the safety and effectiveness of pegbelfermin in a larger number of patients.

<p><span class="paragraphSection"><strong>In Reply</strong> It is promising that institutes such as the NHGRI have chosen to invest in projects addressing the return of individual research results, as Dr Kaufman and colleagues highlight. Conducting rigorous research to answer the &#8220;what, when, and how&#8221; to return these results is important to move the field forward. Although some extant literature exists as identified in their letter, most published studies have focused on the return of genetics research results, which is an important area for consideration. However, empirical data are lacking on the return of other types of results, even those as simple as routine laboratory results. As the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report recommends, an expanded empirical evidence base relevant to the return of individual research results is needed. The report also recommends mechanisms to accelerate evidence generation, such as research sponsors requiring applications to address return of results.</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p><span class="paragraphSection">Health care expenditures continue to increase in the United States, and there have been considerable efforts over the past decade to use health policies, financial incentives, and alternative payment models to address this important issue. Starting in 2007, the Centers for Medicaid &amp; Medicare Services (CMS) sought to reduce early readmissions for common medical conditions among Medicare beneficiaries. The CMS policy approaches included increasing transparency through public reporting of hospital 30-day risk standardized readmission rates (2007-2009 discharges) starting in 2009 and providing financial incentives tied to readmissions though the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), passed under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The HRRP imposed financial penalties on hospitals based on rates of 30-day risk-standardized hospital readmission for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and pneumonia, with up to 3% of a hospital&#8217;s total Medicare revenue from admissions for any condition (target or nontarget) at risk. In fiscal year 2018, 80% of the hospitals subject to the HRRP have been penalized, amounting to $564 million in reduced payments by Medicare.</span>

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Hyperspectral imagery collected from airborne or satellite sources inevitably suffers from spectral variability, making it difficult for spectral unmixing to accurately estimate abundance maps. The classical unmixing model, the linear mixing model (LMM), generally fails to handle this sticky issue effectively. To this end, we propose a novel spectral mixture model, called the augmented LMM, to address spectral variability by applying a data-driven learning strategy in inverse problems of hyperspectral unmixing. The proposed approach models the main spectral variability (i.e., scaling factors) generated by variations in illumination or typography separately by means of the endmember dictionary. It then models other spectral variabilities caused by environmental conditions (e.g., local temperature and humidity and atmospheric effects) and instrumental configurations (e.g., sensor noise), and material nonlinear mixing effects, by introducing a spectral variability dictionary. To effectively run the data-driven learning strategy, we also propose a reasonable prior knowledge for the spectral variability dictionary, whose atoms are assumed to be low-coherent with spectral signatures of endmembers, which leads to a well-known low-coherence dictionary learning problem. Thus, a dictionary learning technique is embedded in the framework of spectral unmixing so that the algorithm can learn the spectral variability dictionary and estimate the abundance maps simultaneously. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets are performed to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with the previous state-of-the-art methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a deep hashing framework, namely, unsupervised deep video hashing (UDVH), for large-scale video similarity search with the aim to learn compact yet effective binary codes. Our UDVH produces the hash codes in a self-taught manner by jointly integrating discriminative video representation with optimal code learning, where an efficient alternating approach is adopted to optimize the objective function. The key differences from most existing video hashing methods lie in: 1) UDVH is an unsupervised hashing method that generates hash codes by cooperatively utilizing feature clustering and a specifically designed binarization with the original neighborhood structure preserved in the binary space and 2) a specific rotation is developed and applied onto video features such that the variance of each dimension can be balanced, thus facilitating the subsequent quantization step. Extensive experiments performed on three popular video datasets show that the UDVH is overwhelmingly better than the state of the arts in terms of various evaluation metrics, which makes it practical in real-world applications.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In conventional wisdom of video modeling, the background is often treated as the primary target and foreground is derived using the technique of background subtraction. Based on the observation that foreground and background are two sides of the same coin, we propose to treat them as peer unknown variables and formulate a joint estimation problem, called Hierarchical modeling and Alternating Optimization (HMAO). The motivation behind our hierarchical extensions of background and foreground models is to better incorporate a priori knowledge about the disparity between background and foreground. For background, we decompose it into temporally low-frequency and high-frequency components for the purpose of better characterizing the class of video with dynamic background; for foreground, we construct a Markov random field prior at a spatially low resolution as the pivot to facilitate the noise-resilient refinement at higher resolutions. Built on hierarchical extensions of both models, we show how to successively refine their joint estimates under a unified framework known as alternating direction multipliers method. Experimental results have shown that our approach produces more discriminative background and demonstrates better robustness to noise than other competing methods. When compared against current state-of-the-art techniques, HMAO achieves at least comparable and often superior performance in terms of F-measure scores, especially for video containing dynamic and complex background.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A procedure to calculate maximum torque operating conditions for the inverter-fed induction machine is proposed in this paper. The proposed procedure minimizes the finite-element analysis computation load by identifying the variation range of stator current and slip frequency for the entire torque-speed map. Thus, the total calculation time for machine steady-state performance estimation can be significantly reduced. The effectiveness of the proposed procedure is validated by an experiment.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a digital-based pulse train (PT) control technique for a boost power factor correction (PFC) converter operating in a discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) is presented, which can achieve nearly unity power factor (PF) over a universal input voltage range. Different from traditional digital control techniques, which usually require complex arithmetic operations, the digital-based PT control technique only needs a simple operation. Besides, a DCM boost PFC converter with digital PT control can operate at a high switching frequency, which is less dependent on the processing speed of a digital controller. Thus, the proposed control strategy can be implemented with general purpose digital controllers, such as low-speed and low-cost microcontroller unit, for the DCM boost PFC converter where the cost is a focus. The operation principle of the digital PT controlled DCM boost PFC converter is analyzed. Experimental results are provided, which show that high PF and low input current total harmonic distortion can be maintained over a universal input voltage range of 90&#x2013;264&#x00a0;V&#x00a0;ac.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a decoupled power control strategy for a modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based hybrid ac&#x2013;dc grid integrated with a hybrid energy storage system. This system can mitigate the active power fluctuations caused by intermittent renewable generation and also realize reactive power compensation as required by voltage regulation. The proposed hybrid ac&#x2013;dc system has a novel configuration in which batteries and supercapacitors are distributed into the upper arm and the lower arm of the MMC, respectively. Therefore, it is possible to design fully decoupled power control and simultaneously optimize the performances of batteries and supercapacitors. First, the system modeling and operational principles of the MMC are briefly introduced in this paper. On the basis of these analyses, the power decoupling between the upper arm and the lower arm is presented to realize different control objectives. Moreover, battery state-of-charge balancing control and supercapacitor voltage control are also presented, which are crucial for ensuring the normal operation of these energy storage components and the proposed MMC-based hybrid ac&#x2013;dc grid. Finally, the proposed system and its control strategies are verified by laboratory experimental results.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel approach for detection of stator short-circuit faults in three-phase induction motors. The method is based on two stages: feature extraction and classification by intelligent systems. First, mutual information is estimated from delayed stator current signals, which are used as inputs of C4.5 decision trees and multilayer perceptron neural networks in the second step. Several offline and online experimental tests are presented considering voltage unbalance, load torque variations, and 1&#x0025; to 10&#x0025; short-circuit levels. The obtained results corroborate the effectiveness of this new diagnostic approach.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This letter proposes a novel multipulse rectifier. The proposed rectifier is a combination of a novel dual-passive-harmonic-reduction method and a traditional double-star uncontrolled rectifier. The proposed method contains a multiwinding interphase reactor (IPR) and the corresponding auxiliary circuit. From the viewpoint of minimizing the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the input line current, the turn ratio of the multiwinding IPR is optimally designed. Under the optimal turn ratio, the proposed rectifier operates as an 18-pulse rectifier. Its theoretical THD of the input line current is about 10.1&#x0025;, and its experimental THD is 6.58&#x0025;. The proposed method is simple and easy to realize.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Lung cancer is the type of cancer that most often kills after the initial diagnosis. To aid the specialist in its diagnosis, temporal evaluation is a potential tool for analyzing indeterminate lesions, which may be benign or malignant, during treatment. With this goal in mind, a methodology is herein proposed for the analysis, quantification, and visualization of changes in lung lesions. This methodology uses a modified version of the quality threshold clustering algorithm to associate each voxel of the lesion to a cluster, and changes in the lesion over time are defined in terms of voxel moves to another cluster. In addition, statistical features are extracted for classification of the lesion as benign or malignant. To develop the proposed methodology, two databases of pulmonary lesions were used, one for malignant lesions in treatment (public) and the other for indeterminate cases (private). We determined that the density change percentage varied from 6.22&#x0025; to 36.93&#x0025; of lesion volume in the public database of malignant lesions under treatment and from 19.98&#x0025; to 38.81&#x0025; in the private database of lung nodules. Additionally, other inter-cluster density change measures were obtained. These measures indicate the degree of change in the clusters and how each of them is abundant in relation to volume. From the statistical analysis of regions in which the density changes occurred, we were able to discriminate lung lesions with an accuracy of 98.41&#x0025;, demonstrating that these changes can indicate the true nature of the lesion. In addition to visualizing the density changes occurring in lesions over time, we quantified these changes and analyzed the entire set through volumetry, which is the technique most commonly used to analyze changes in pulmonary lesions.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Metaheuristic techniques have shown remarkable performance in a vast variety of engineering problems. Accurate solving of nonlinear equation set in selective harmonic elimination (SHE) has been one of the widely discussed numerical problems in power electronics. Current study aims at conducting an inclusive comparison of prominent stochastic methods adopted for SHE and modified SHE (MSHE) pulse width modulation techniques. The problem is defined as finding local optima of cascaded H-bride converter operation parameters. The survey investigates key indices of low-order harmonic components and weighted total harmonic distortion. Floating fundamental component is introduced for SHE and MSHE to achieve higher rate of flexibility for optimization techniques. Finally, an advanced modulation technique is proposed to address the dc-link voltage ripples. Simulation and experimental results are presented as a proof of concept.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper investigates the peak-to-peak filtering problem for a class of networked nonlinear dc motor systems with quantization. The nonlinear dc motor system is modeled by a Takagi&#x2013;Sugeno (T&#x2013;S) fuzzy model. Consider that the measurement output signal and the performance output signal of the system are quantized by two static quantizers before being transmitted by the digital communication channel, respectively. Attention is focused on the design of a peak-to-peak filter such that the filtering error system is asymptotically stable and satisfies the prescribed peak-to-peak filtering performance index. Sufficient conditions for such a peak-to-peak filter are expressed in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, an illustrative simulation is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Effectively monitoring maritime environments has become a vital problem in maritime applications. Traditional methods are not only expensive and time consuming but also restricted in both time and space. More recently, the concept of an industrial wireless sensor network (IWSN) has become a promising alternative for monitoring next-generation intelligent maritime grids, because IWSNs are cost-effective and easy to deploy. This paper focuses on solving the issue of 3-D IWSN deployment in a 3-D engine room space of a very large crude-oil carrier and also considers numerous power facilities. To address this 3-D IWSN deployment problem for maritime applications, a 3-D uncertain coverage model is proposed that uses a modified 3-D sensing model and an uncertain fusion operator. The deployment problem is converted into a multiobjective optimization problem that simultaneously addresses three objectives: coverage, lifetime, and reliability. Our goal is to achieve extensive coverage, long network lifetime, and high reliability. We also propose a distributed parallel cooperative coevolutionary multiobjective large-scale evolutionary algorithm for maritime applications. We verify the effectiveness of this algorithm through experiments by comparing it with five state-of-the-art algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method performs most effectively both in optimization performance and in minimizing the computation time.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is used for the first time to detect fabricated defects in a glass fiber-skinned lightweight honeycomb composite panel. A novel amplitude polynomial regression (APR) algorithm is proposed as a preprocessing method. This method segments the amplitude&#x2013;frequency curves to simulate the heating and the cooling monotonic behavior as in infrared thermography. Then, the method of empirical orthogonal function (EOF) imaging is applied on the APR preprocessed data as a postprocessing algorithm. Signal-to-noise ratio analysis is performed to verify the image improvement of the proposed APR-EOF modality from a quantitative point of view. Finally, the experimental results and the physical analysis show that THz is more suitable with respect to the detection of defects in glass fiber lightweight honeycomb composites.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Depth information is being widely used in many real-world applications. However, due to the limitation of depth sensing technology, the captured depth map in practice usually has much lower resolution than that of color image counterpart. In this paper, we propose to combine the internal smoothness prior and external gradient consistency constraint in graph domain for depth super-resolution. On one hand, a new graph Laplacian regularizer is proposed to preserve the inherent piecewise smooth characteristic of depth, which has desirable filtering properties. A specific weight matrix of the respect graph is defined to make full use of information of both depth and the corresponding guidance image. On the other hand, inspired by an observation that the gradient of depth is small except at edge separating regions, we introduce a graph gradient consistency constraint to enforce that the graph gradient of depth is close to the thresholded gradient of guidance. We reinterpret the gradient thresholding model as variational optimization with sparsity constraint. In this way, we remedy the problem of structure discrepancy between depth and guidance. Finally, the internal and external regularizations are casted into a unified optimization framework, which can be efficiently addressed by ADMM. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art with respect to both objective and subjective quality evaluations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Online social networks (OSNs) are providing a variety of applications for human users to interact with families, friends, and even strangers. One such application, the friend search engine, allows the general public to query individual users' friend lists and has been gaining popularity recently. However, without proper design, this application may mistakenly disclose users' private relationship information. Our previous work has proposed a privacy preservation solution that can effectively boost OSNs' sociability while protecting users' friendship privacy against attacks launched by individual malicious requestors. In this paper, we propose an advanced collusion attack, where a victim user's friendship privacy can be compromised through a series of carefully designed queries coordinately launched by multiple malicious requestors. The effect of the proposed collusion attack is validated through synthetic and real-world social network data sets. The in-depth research on the advanced collusion attacks will help us design a more robust and secure friend search engine on OSNs in the near future.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Garbled circuits are general tools that allow two parties to compute any function without disclosing their respective inputs. Applications of this technique vary from distributed privacy-preserving machine learning tasks to secure outsourced authentication. Unfortunately, the energy cost of garbled circuit evaluation protocols is substantial. This limits the applicability of garbled circuits in scenarios that involve battery-operated devices, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and smartphones. In this paper, we propose MEG, a Memory- and Energy-efficient Garbled circuit evaluation mechanism. MEG utilizes batch data transmission and multi-threading to reduce memory and energy consumption. We implement MEG on an Android smartphone and compare its performance and energy consumption with state-of-the-art techniques using two garbled circuits of widely different sizes (AES-128 and 256-bit edit distance). Our results show that, compared with &#x201c;plain&#x201d; garbled circuit evaluation, MEG decreases memory consumption by more than 90%. When compared with current pipelined garbled circuit evaluation techniques, MEG's energy usage was 42% lower for AES-128 and 23% lower for EDT-256. Furthermore, our multi-thread implementation of MEG decreased circuit evaluation time by up to 56.7% for AES-128, and by up to 13.5% for EDT-256, compared with state-of-the-art pipelining techniques.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper introduces a new similarity measure, the covering similarity, which we formally define for evaluating the similarity between a symbolic sequence and a set of symbolic sequences. A pairwise similarity can also be directly derived from the covering similarity to compare two symbolic sequences. An efficient implementation to compute the covering similarity is proposed which uses a suffix-tree data structure, but other implementations, based on suffix array for instance, are possible and are possibly necessary for handling very large-scale problems. We have used this similarity to isolate attack sequences from normal sequences in the scope of host-based intrusion detection. We have assessed the covering similarity on two well-known benchmarks in the field. In view of the results reported on these two datasets for the state-of-the-art methods, according to the comparative study, we have carried out based on three challenging similarity measures commonly used for string processing, or in bioinformatics, we show that the covering similarity is particularly relevant to address the detection of anomalies in sequences of system calls.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to its cost efficiency, the controller area network (CAN) is still the most wide-spread in-vehicle bus, and the numerous reported attacks demonstrate the urgency in designing new security solutions for CAN. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection mechanism that takes advantage of Bloom filtering to test frame periodicity based on message identifiers and parts of the data-field which facilitates detection of potential replay or modification attacks. This proves to be an effective approach since most of the traffic from in-vehicle buses is cyclic in nature and the format of the data-field is fixed due to rigid signal allocation. Bloom filters provide an efficient time-memory tradeoff which is beneficial for the constrained resources of automotive grade controllers. We test the correctness of our approach and obtain good results on an industry-standard CANoe-based simulation for a J1939 commercial-vehicle bus and also on CAN with flexible data-rate traces obtained from a real-world high-end vehicle. The proposed filtering mechanism is straightforward to adapt for any other time-triggered in-vehicle bus, e.g., FlexRay, since it is built on time-driven characteristics.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we consider user scheduling and power allocation techniques for downlinks where transmitted message must be kept confidential from all other unintended users and the number of users is larger than that of access point (AP) antennas. In order to maximize network secrecy rate with a limited number of antennas, the AP schedules a user who can achieve the largest secrecy rate and exploits multiple antennas for transmitting artificial noise to the unintended users. We derive the closed-form expressions of the optimal power allocation for the artificial noise and the average network secrecy rate through asymptotic analysis. The analysis results provide the insightful information on the behaviors of the user scheduling and the effect of system parameters on the network secrecy rate performance. It is shown that opportunistic scheduling with artificial noise transmission technique is more effective than the conventional precoding techniques for multiple confidential message transmissions in terms of network secrecy rate. Furthermore, we have also discussed a transmission strategy for the worst case scenarios where all unintended users are treated as colluding eavesdroppers. The simulations confirm the validity of the analysis results and provide additional information on the network performance in general cases.
