<p>Local differential privacy (LDP) has been deemed as the de facto measure for
privacy-preserving distributed data collection and analysis. Recently,
researchers have extended LDP to the basic data type in NoSQL systems: the
key-value data, and show its feasibilities in mean estimation and frequency
estimation. In this paper, we develop a set of new perturbation mechanisms for
key-value data collection and analysis under the strong model of local
differential privacy. Since many modern machine learning tasks rely on the
availability of conditional probability or the marginal statistics, we then
propose the conditional frequency estimation method for key analysis and the
conditional mean estimation for value analysis in key-value data. The released
statistics with conditions can further be used in learning tasks. Extensive
experiments of frequency and mean estimation on both synthetic and real-world
datasets validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed key-value
perturbation mechanisms against the state-of-art competitors.

<p>Malware attacks represent a significant part of today's security threats.
Software guard extensions (SGX) are a set of hardware instructions introduced
by Intel in their recent lines of processors that are intended to provide a
secure execution environment for user-developed applications. To our knowledge,
there was no serious attempt yet to overcome the SGX protection by leveraging
the software supply chain infrastructure, such as weaknesses in the
development, build or signing servers. While SGX protection does not
specifically take into consideration such threats, we show in the current paper
that a simple malware attack exploiting a separation between the build and
signing processes can have a serious damaging impact, practically nullifying
the SGX integrity protection measures. Finally, we also suggest some possible
mitigations against the attack.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We quickly approach a "pervasive future" where pervasive computing is the
norm. In this scenario, humans are surrounded by a multitude of heterogeneous
devices that assist them in almost every aspect of their daily routines. The
realization of this future demands strong authentication guarantees to ensure
that these devices are not abused and that their users are not endangered.
However, providing authentication for these systems is a challenging task due
to the high heterogeneity of pervasive computing applications. This
heterogeneity makes it unfeasible to propose a single authentication solution
for all of the pervasive computing applications. In this paper, we review
several pervasive application scenarios and promising authentication methods
for each. To do this, we first identify the key characteristics of each
pervasive application scenario. Then, we review the strengths and weaknesses of
prominent authentication methods from the literature. Finally, we identify
which authentication methods are well suited for each application scenario
based on the identified characteristics. Our goal is to provide promising
directions to be explored for authentication in each of these scenarios.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We propose the first framework for defining relational program logics for
arbitrary monadic effects. The framework is embedded within a relational
dependent type theory and is highly expressive. At the semantic level, we
provide an algebraic characterization for relational specifications as a class
of relative monads, and link computations and specifications by introducing
relational effect observations, which map pairs of monadic computations to
relational specifications in a way that respects the algebraic structure. For
an arbitrary relational effect observation, we generically define the core of a
sound relational program logic, and explain how to complete it to a
full-fledged logic for the monadic effect at hand. We show that by
instantiating our framework with state and unbounded iteration we can embed a
variant of Benton's Relational Hoare Logic, and also sketch how to reconstruct
Relational Hoare Type Theory. Finally, we identify and overcome conceptual
challenges that prevented previous relational program logics from properly
dealing with effects such as exceptions, and are the first to provide a proper
semantic foundation and a relational program logic for exceptions.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Our work focuses on the design of a scalable permissionless blockchain in the
proof-of-stake setting. In particular, we use a distributed hash table as a
building block to set up randomized shards, and then leverage the sharded
architecture to validate blocks in an efficient manner. We combine verifiable
Byzantine agreements run by shards of stakeholders and a block validation
protocol to guarantee that forks occur with negligible probability. We impose
induced churn to make shards robust to eclipse attacks, and we rely on the UTXO
coin model to guarantee that any stakeholder action is securely verifiable by
anyone. Our protocol works against adaptive adversary, and makes no synchrony
assumption beyond what is required for the byzantine agreement.

Ultimately, ending all cases of poliomyelitis requires successful cessation of the use of all live-attenuated oral poliovirus vaccines (OPV) after certification of WPV eradication. Global transmission of serotype-2 WPV ended before 2000; in September, 2015, the world certified serotype-2 WPV eradication;2 and in late April and early May, 2016, the GPEI globally coordinated the cessation of all use of serotype -2-containing OPV (OPV2), except for in emergency uses to respond to serotype-2 outbreaks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Age synthesis is a challenging task due to the complicated and non-linear transformation in the human aging process. Aging information is usually reflected in local facial parts, such as wrinkles at the eye corners. However, these local facial parts contribute less in previous GAN-based methods for age synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet-domain global and local consistent age generative adversarial network (WaveletGLCA-GAN), in which one global specific network and three local specific networks are integrated together to capture both global topology information and local texture details of human faces. Different from the most existing methods that modeling age synthesis in image domain, we adopt wavelet transform to depict the textual information in frequency domain. Moreover, five types of losses are adopted: 1) adversarial loss aims to generate realistic wavelets; 2) identity preserving loss aims to better preserve identity information; 3) age preserving loss aims to enhance the accuracy of age synthesis; 4) pixel-wise loss aims to preserve the background information of the input face; and 5) the total variation regularization aims to remove ghosting artifacts. Our method is evaluated on three face aging datasets, including CACD2000, Morph, and FG-NET. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show the superiority of the proposed method over other state-of-the-arts.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the increasing connectivity enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), security becomes a critical concern, and users should invest to secure their IoT applications. Due to the massive devices in the IoT network, users cannot be aware of the security policies taken by all its connected neighbors. Instead, a user makes security decisions based on the cyber risks that he perceives by observing a selected number of nodes. To this end, we propose a model which incorporates the limited attention or bounded rationality nature of players in the IoT. Specifically, each individual builds a sparse cognitive network of nodes to respond to. Based on this simplified cognitive network representation, each user then determines his security management policy by minimizing his own real-world security cost. The bounded rational decision-makings of players and their cognitive network formations are interdependent and thus should be addressed in a holistic manner. We establish a games-in-games framework and propose a Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE) solution concept to characterize the decisions of agents and quantify their risk of bounded perception due to the limited attention. In addition, we design a proximal-based iterative algorithm to compute the GNE. With case studies of smart communities, the designed algorithm can successfully identify the critical users whose decisions need to be taken into account by the other users during the security management.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper considers the scenario that multiple data owners wish to apply a machine learning method over the combined dataset of all owners to obtain the best possible learning output but do not want to share the local datasets owing to privacy concerns. We design systems for the scenario that the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm is used as the machine learning method, because SGD (or its variants) is at the heart of recent deep learning techniques over neural networks. Our systems differ from the existing systems in the following features: 1) any activation function can be used, meaning that no privacy-preserving-friendly approximation is required; 2) gradients computed by SGD are not shared but the weight parameters are shared instead; and 3) robustness against colluding parties even in the extreme case that only one honest party exists. One of our systems requires a shared symmetric key among the data owners (trainers) to ensure the secrecy of the weight parameters against a central server. We prove that our systems, while privacy preserving, achieve the same learning accuracy as SGD and, hence, retain the merit of deep learning with respect to accuracy. Finally, we conduct several experiments using benchmark datasets and show that our systems outperform the previous system in terms of learning accuracies.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we are interested in the problem of strengthening the secrecy of distributed encryption in a particular case where the encryption keys are correlated to each other. We show that the post-encryption-compression (PEC) paradigm provides a suitable solution for the problem without requiring any additional secret randomness. More precisely, we show that in the case of one-time-pad encryption, we can use affine encoders with specific properties to strengthen the secrecy by using them to compress the ciphertexts before sending them to public communication channels. We show how to derive those affine encoders using universal code construction paradigm. The universal code construction gives us advantages as follows. 1) We can construct good encoders based on the transmission rates only, without knowing the value of the distribution of sources or keys. 2) Reliability and secrecy are achievable by construction even in particular cases such as follows: 1) only the range of correlation between keys is known but the exact amount is unknown or 2) the correlation between keys are changing time to time within a certain range. We also derive explicit lower bounds on the achievable reliability and secrecy exponents, i.e., the exponential rates of decay of the probability of decoding error and of the information leakage as the block length becomes large.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A navigation algorithm for source seeking in a sensor network environment is presented in this paper. The solution consists of a gradient-free approach and maximum likelihood topology maps of sensor networks. The robot is navigated using an angular velocity limited by maximum and minimum constants, and by sensor measurements gathered by sensors that are close to robot&#x0027;s current location. The location of the robot is calculated using sensor topology coordinates, which is an alternative to the physical coordinate system and does not depend on physical distance measurement techniques such as received signal strength. However, actual physical distances are hidden in topology maps due to nonlinear distortions compared to physical distance between nodes. Thus, the proposed control law does not depend on any distance-based information. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using computer simulations and experiments with a real mobile robot.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Smart grid is a cyber-physical system with interdependent power grid and communication network. Such interdependence make the smart grid fragile against cascading failures, where an initial failure in communication network may lead to further failures in power grid, and vice versa. We prevent such inter-network cascading failure by stopping an initial failure from propagating. This is achieved by providing a sufficient number of power-disjoint communication routes between power nodes and control center. The number of power-disjoint routes is a robustness metric. We aim to maximize robustness by configuring the interdependence relationship between power grid and communication networks. Such relationship indicates which power node supplies energy to which communication node, and which communication route is used to connect which power node to the control center. Following Menger&#x0027;s Theorem, we transform such configuration problem into a Maxflow problem and solve it using the simplex algorithm. We have evaluated the proposed method through extensive simulations. The results confirm the optimality and computational efficiency of the proposed method. The number of power-disjoint routes increases with an increase in the network size, but can never exceed the number of node-disjoint routes for a same network.

<p>This paper proposes an optimal power scheduling strategy for cooperative operation of multiple-coupled microgrids, where the microgrid coalition makes day-ahead energy exchange commitments with the grid. Deviations from their commitments are limited by penalizing the microgrids. Various system intermittencies are captured via scenarios. The framework aims at maximizing the expected profit of each microgrid, while mitigating the distribution power losses by enabling local power trades between all microgrids within a coalition. The scheduling problem only utilizes the power exchange requests as the control signals between participating microgrids. Extensive numerical results are presented to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The growing number of attacks against cyber-physical systems in recent years elevates the concern for cybersecurity of industrial control systems (ICSs). The current efforts of ICS cybersecurity are mainly based on firewalls, data diodes, and other methods of intrusion prevention, which may not be sufficient for growing cyber threats from motivated attackers. To enhance the cybersecurity of ICS, a cyber-attack detection system built on the concept of defense-in-depth is developed utilizing network traffic data, host system data, and measured process parameters. This attack detection system provides multiple-layer defense in order to gain the defenders precious time before unrecoverable consequences occur in the physical system. The data used for demonstrating the proposed detection system are from a real-time ICS testbed. Five attacks, including man in the middle (MITM), denial of service (DoS), data exfiltration, data tampering, and false data injection, are carried out to simulate the consequences of cyber attack and generate data for building data-driven detection models. Four classical classification models based on network data and host system data are studied, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree, bootstrap aggregating (bagging), and random forest (RF), to provide a secondary line of defense of cyber-attack detection in the event that the intrusion prevention layer fails. Intrusion detection results suggest that KNN, bagging, and RF have low missed alarm and false alarm rates for MITM and DoS attacks, providing accurate and reliable detection of these cyber attacks. Cyber attacks that may not be detectable by monitoring network and host system data, such as command tampering and false data injection attacks by an insider, are monitored for by traditional process monitoring protocols. In the proposed detection system, an auto-associative kernel regression model is studied to strengthen early attack detection. The result shows that this approach de-
ects physically impactful cyber attacks before significant consequences occur. The proposed multiple-layer data-driven cyber-attack detection system utilizing network, system, and process data is a promising solution for safeguarding an ICS.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A novel version of the traditional space vector modulation (SVM) technique, with the integration of the rotating vectors, hereinafter referred to as expanded SVM, is introduced in this paper. Although different ways to benefit from the rotating vectors&#x2019; configuration have already been proposed in the literature, the generalization of the SVM theory to include them has not been proposed so far. The rotating vectors are grouped in rotating pairs, which are demonstrated to behave, by all practical aspects, as any other stationary vector. As a consequence, a circular modulation style is developed, which comprises increased flexibility over the traditional approach, thus improving the direct matrix converter capabilities. The new technique is used to achieve safe commutation, even though it might have been also applied to improve the switching losses as well. Besides the theoretical analysis, simulation and experimental results are shown to support the feasibility of the approach.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Energy imbalance market (EIM) provides an opportunity that allows larger shares of variable renewable energy sources in the grid. Under highly volatile weather conditions, an accurate forecasting of photovoltaic (PV) power is necessary for grid stability and market operation. Most of existing forecasting methods strongly rely on the accuracy of measurements, and the adaptability of these methods to complex weather conditions is rarely discussed. In this paper, a weather classification multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) forecasting model is introduced for complex weather conditions in all seasons. It can be updated incrementally and its high computational efficiency satisfies EIM operations. A data set that consists of the historical power and meteorological parameters produced by a small-scale PV platform is classified and used to train MARS models with forecast horizons ranging from 15 min to 24 h in different seasons. The tests and analyses results indicate higher accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency of the novel model.

<p>In this paper, a two-degrees-of-freedom control algorithm based on uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE), aimed to minimize the total harmonic distortion of inverter output voltage is proposed, possessing enhanced robustness to fundamental frequency variations. A multiple-time-delay action is combined with a commonly utilized low-pass UDE filter to increase the range of output impedance magnitude minimization around odd multiples of fundamental frequency for enhanced rejection of typical single-phase nonlinear loads harmonics. Marginal robustness improvement achieved by increasing the number of time delays is quantified analytically and revealed to be independent of delay order. The performance of the proposed control approach and its superiority over two recently proposed methods is validated successfully by experimental results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper introduces a novel self-tuned perturb and observe (SPO) algorithm for quick maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and a novel maximize-M Kalman filter (MMKF)-based control technique for optimal operation of grid-integrated solar photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion system, where linear&#x002f;nonlinear loads are attached at point of common coupling (PCC). The proposed SPO is the improved form of perturb and observe (P&amp;O) algorithm, where inherent problems of traditional P&amp;O such as steady-state oscillation, slow dynamic responses, and fixed step size issues, are successfully mitigated. Therefore, SPO tracks maximum power peak (MPP) very rapidly, and it very accurately extracts maximum power from the PV array. The extracted power is used to meet the active power requirement of loads, and after meeting the load demand, the excess power is supplied to the grid. During power feeding, the power quality and power management are maintained by the MMKF-based control technique. In control strategy, the MMKF is used for fundamental harmonic component extraction from the grid voltage and load current, even when the grid voltage is characterized by adverse situations, such as sag, swell, harmonic distortion, dc offset, etc. Here, the SPO MPPT algorithm and MMKF-based control techniques are tested on a developed prototype. The efficient and reliable performances of SPO MPPT algorithm and MMKF-based control algorithm, in dynamic as well as in steady-state condition, are demonstrated under insolation variation conditions, nonlinear loading, as well as in different grid disturbances such as overvoltage, undervoltage, phase imbalance, harmonics distortion in the grid voltage, etc.

<p>The back-to-back (BTB) converter is one of the most popular converter topologies for the control of electrical machines, power transmission systems, and power quality applications. The conventional cascade control structure is commonly used due to its simple design procedure and reliable operation. However, the bandwidth of the dc-link voltage controller has to be limited in order to avoid instability issues and be restrictive in high-performance applications. This paper presents a differential- and common-current (power)-based state-feedback control for BTB converters. This controller features a fast control of active and reactive powers, and a stiff regulation of the dc-link voltage. A theoretical analysis of the proposed controller along with a strategy for current limiting is presented. Its robustness was tested against variations of the filter parameters, the dc capacitance, the grid inductance, and the grid voltage values. The controller was experimentally validated under nominal operation, voltage sags, and connected to a weak grid by using a 15-kVA BTB converter in a laboratory test network.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Filtering images of more than one channel are challenging in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. By grouping similar patches to utilize the self-similarity and sparse linear approximation of natural images, recent nonlocal and transform-domain methods have been widely used in color and multispectral image (MSI) denoising. Many related methods focus on the modeling of group level correlation to enhance sparsity, which often resorts to a recursive strategy with a large number of similar patches. The importance of the patch level representation is understated. In this paper, we mainly investigate the influence and potential of representation at patch level by considering a general formulation with a block diagonal matrix. We further show that by training a proper global patch basis, along with a local principal component analysis transform in the grouping dimension, a simple transform-threshold-inverse method could produce very competitive results. Fast implementation is also developed to reduce the computational complexity. The extensive experiments on both the simulated and real datasets demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness, and efficiency.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose and develop a novel nonlocal variational technique based on structural similarity (SS) information for image restoration problems. In the literature, patches extracted from images are compared according to their pixel values, and then nonlocal filtering can be employed for image restoration. The disadvantage of this approach is that intensity-based patch distance may not be effective in image restoration, especially for images containing texture or structural information. The main aim of this paper is to propose using SS between image patches to develop nonlocal regularization models. In particular, two types of nonlocal regularizing functions are studied: an SS-based nonlocal quadratic function (SS-NLH1) and an SS-based nonlocal total variation function (SS-NLTV) for regularization of image restoration problems. Moreover, we employ iterative algorithms to solve these SS-NLH1 and SS-NLTV variational models numerically and discuss the convergence of these algorithms. The experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Capturing images at high ISO modes will introduce much realistic noise, which is difficult to be removed by traditional denoising methods. In this paper, we propose a novel denoising method for high ISO JPEG images via deep fusion of collaborative and convolutional filtering. Collaborative filtering explores the non-local similarity of natural images, while convolutional filtering takes advantage of the large capacity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to infer noise from noisy images. We observe that the noise variance map of a high ISO JPEG image is spatial-dependent and has a Bayer-like pattern. Therefore, we introduce the Bayer pattern prior in our noise estimation and collaborative filtering stages. Since collaborative filtering is good at recovering repeatable structures and convolutional filtering is good at recovering irregular patterns and removing noise in flat regions, we propose to fuse the strengths of the two methods via deep CNN. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art realistic noise removal methods for a wide variety of testing images in both subjective and objective measurements. In addition, we construct a dataset with noisy and clean image pairs for high ISO JPEG images to facilitate research on this topic.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Semantic segmentation, a pixel-level vision task, is rapidly developed by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Training CNNs requires a large amount of labeled data, but manually annotating data is difficult. For emancipating manpower, in recent years, some synthetic datasets are released. However, they are still different from real scenes, which causes that training a model on the synthetic data (source domain) cannot achieve a good performance on real urban scenes (target domain). In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised adversarial domain adaptation to improve the segmentation performance from synthetic data to real scenes, which consists of three deep neural networks. A detection and segmentation (DS) model focuses on detecting objects and predicting segmentation map; a pixel-level domain classifier (PDC) tries to distinguish the image features from which domains; and an object-level domain classifier (ODC) discriminates the objects from which domains and predicts object classes. PDC and ODC are treated as the discriminators, and DS is considered as the generator. By the adversarial learning, DS is supposed to learn domain-invariant features. In experiments, our proposed method yields the new record of mIoU metric in the same problem.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Multi-illuminant-based color constancy (MCC) is quite a challenging task. In this paper, we proposed a novel model motivated by the bottom-up and top-down mechanisms of human visual system (HVS) to estimate the spatially varying illumination in a scene. The motivation for bottom-up based estimation is from our finding that the bright and dark parts in a scene play different roles in encoding illuminants. However, handling the color shift of large colorful objects is difficult using pure bottom-up processing. Thus, we further introduce a top-down constraint inspired by the findings in visual psychophysics, in which high-level information (e.g., the prior of light source colors) plays a key role in visual color constancy. In order to implement the top-down hypothesis, we simply learn a color mapping between the illuminant distribution estimated by bottom-up processing and the ground truth maps provided by the dataset. We evaluated our model on four datasets and the results show that our method obtains very competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art MCC algorithms. Moreover, the robustness of our model is more tangible considering that our results were obtained using the same parameters for all the datasets or the parameters of our model were learned from the inputs, that is, mimicking how HVS operates. We also show the color correction results on some real-world images taken from the web.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In public cloud storage services, data are outsourced to semi-trusted cloud servers which are outside of data owners&#x2019; trusted domain. To prevent untrustworthy service providers from accessing data owners&#x2019; sensitive data, outsourced data are often encrypted. In this scenario, conducting access control over these data becomes a challenging issue. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) has been proved to be a powerful cryptographic tool to express access policies over attributes, which can provide a fine-grained, flexible, and secure access control over outsourced data. However, the existing ABE-based access control schemes do not support users to gain access permission by collaboration. In this paper, we explore a special attribute-based access control scenario where multiple users having different attribute sets can collaborate to gain access permission if the data owner allows their collaboration in the access policy. Meanwhile, the collaboration that is not designated in the access policy should be regarded as a collusion and the access request will be denied. We propose an attribute-based controlled collaborative access control scheme through designating translation nodes in the access structure. Security analysis shows that our proposed scheme can guarantee data confidentiality and has many other critical security properties. Extensive performance analysis shows that our proposed scheme is efficient in terms of storage and computation overhead.
