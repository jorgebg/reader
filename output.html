<p>Ebolaviruses are pathogenic agents associated with a severe, potentially fatal, systemic disease in man and great apes. Four species of ebolaviruses have been identified in west or equatorial Africa. Once the more virulent forms enter the human population, transmission occurs primarily through contact with infected body fluids and can result in major epidemics in under-resourced settings. These viruses cause a disease characterised by systemic viral replication, immune suppression, abnormal inflammatory responses, major fluid and electrolyte losses, and high mortality.

<p><span class="paragraphSection"><strong>In Reply</strong> Dr Razvi and colleagues argue that the negative results in our meta-analysis of thyroid hormone therapy in persons with subclinical hypothyroidism for QOL were driven by TRUST and that this trial was negative because it &#8220;recruited largely asymptomatic older individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism.&#8221; However, the TRUST participants were not &#8220;largely asymptomatic&#8221;: the mean ThyPRO hypothyroid symptom score at baseline was 17 and the mean tiredness score was 25 (range for both scores, 0-100, with higher scores indicating worse symptoms), and only 5% had no hypothyroid symptoms. If we exclude TRUST and reanalyze the meta-analysis for QOL, the mean age of the 158 participants from the remaining 3 RCTs decreases to 55 years, and this restricted analysis also indicates no benefit of levothyroxine treatment (standardized mean difference [positive values indicate benefit of levothyroxine], &#8722;0.18; 95% CI, &#8722;0.50 to 0.14). Therefore, our results for the meta-analysis for QOL were robust and not solely dependent on TRUST.</span>

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p><span class="paragraphSection">By the time surgeons complete residency or fellowship training, they must be able to independently perform surgery. This can only occur if surgeons have graded responsibility, meaning that surgical residents must be able to do various parts of an operation on their own until they have mastered the skills necessary to function completely independently. One way this is done is by allowing overlapping surgery&#8212;operations in which someone other than the attending surgeon performs part of the operation. In this issue of <span style="font-style: italic;">JAMA</span>, Sun and colleagues report outcomes for overlapping surgery to show that this mechanism, which is essential for training surgical residents, is generally safe. Mortality and complications were approximately the same for operations that had substantial overlap (more than 1 hour of the procedure from the time of incision) as compared with no overlap. However, there was a signal that outcomes (mortality and complications) might be worse for high-risk patients, a scenario that makes intuitive sense. This work appealed to me because it answered an important, unresolved question: Is surgery safe as practiced in academic environments that balance the needs of safe patient care with those required to train the next generation of surgeons? The answer appears to be yes.</span>

<p><span class="paragraphSection">The modern era of medicine began in the 1960s. Health care coverage expanded with the passage of Medicare and Medicaid and the increasing availability of employee-based health insurance. Scientific and clinical advances began to occur at a far more rapid pace. Physicians became more specialized and began to focus on acute care dominated by cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer rather than infectious diseases, and there was increasing recognition of the importance of chronic diseases. With more data available, it became possible to measure variation in the delivery and quality of care, along with disparities and rationing in the provision of care. Health care costs per person more than doubled between 1960 and 1970, beginning their 5-decade increase.</span>

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized the computer vision research and have seen unprecedented adoption for multiple tasks, such as classification, detection, and caption generation. However, they offer little transparency into their inner workings and are often treated as black boxes that deliver excellent performance. In this paper, we aim at alleviating this opaqueness of CNNs by providing visual explanations for the network's predictions. Our approach can analyze a variety of CNN-based models trained for computer vision applications, such as object recognition and caption generation. Unlike the existing methods, we achieve this via unraveling the forward pass operation. The proposed method exploits feature dependencies across the layer hierarchy and uncovers the discriminative image locations that guide the network's predictions. We name these locations CNN fixations, loosely analogous to human eye fixations. Our approach is a generic method that requires no architectural changes, additional training, or gradient computation, and computes the important image locations (CNN fixations). We demonstrate through a variety of applications that our approach is able to localize the discriminative image locations across different network architectures, diverse vision tasks, and data modalities.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fractional interpolation is used to provide sub-pixel level references for motion compensation in the interprediction of video coding, which attempts to remove temporal redundancy in video sequences. Traditional handcrafted fractional interpolation filters face the challenge of modeling discontinuous regions in videos, while existing deep learning-based methods are either designed for a single quantization parameter (QP), only generating half-pixel samples, or need to train a model for each sub-pixel position. In this paper, we present a one-for-all fractional interpolation method based on a grouped variation convolutional neural network (GVCNN). Our method can deal with video frames coded using different QPs and is capable of generating all sub-pixel positions at one sub-pixel level. Also, by predicting variations between integer-position pixels and sub-pixels, our network offers more expressive power. Moreover, we perform specific measurements in training data generation to simulate practical situations in video coding, including blurring the down-sampled sub-pixel samples to avoid aliasing effects and coding integer pixels to simulate reconstruction errors. In addition, we analyze the impact of the size of blur kernels theoretically. Experimental results verify the efficiency of GVCNN. Compared with HEVC, our method achieves 2.2% in bit saving on average and up to 5.2% under low-delay P configuration.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Video watermarking is a well-established technology to help identify digital pirates when they illegally re-distribute multimedia content. In order to provide every client with a unique, watermarked video, the traditional distribution architectures separately encode each watermarked video. However, since these encodings require a high amount of computational resources, such architectures do not scale well to a large number of users. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel architecture that uses fast encoders instead of traditional, full encoders. The fast encoders re-use the coding information from a single, previously-encoded, unwatermarked video in order to speed up the encodings of the watermarked videos. As a result, the complexity of a fast encoder is only a fraction of the complexity of a full encoder. Due to a high correlation of the re-used coding information with the optimal coding information, the compression efficiency and watermark robustness decrease only slightly. Most importantly, the proposed fast encoder speeds up the compression process with a factor of 115, resulting in a low complexity similar to that of a video decoder. Consequently, video distributors can use the proposed architecture to deliver high-quality watermarked videos on a large-scale without requiring an excessive amount of computational resources.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Because of the dynamic nature of network traffic patterns, such as new traffic application arrivals or flash events, it is becoming increasingly difficult for conventional anomaly detection systems to separate various applications based on their traffic patterns. In this paper, by leveraging transport layer packet-level and flow-level features, new structures called application fingerprints are generated, which express such features in a compact and efficient manner. Based on the generated fingerprints, we propose a novel traffic classification framework. The proposed system generates profiles of normal applications using a multi-modal probability distribution. The proposed classification framework is then extended to detect distributed denial of service attacks from the collected statistical information at flow level. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system, we evaluate its performance using five real-world traffic datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method is capable of achieving an accuracy of over 97&#x0025;, whereas the misclassification rate is only 2.5&#x0025;.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) botnets have become one of the major threats in network security for serving as the fundamental infrastructure for various cyber-crimes. More challenges are involved in the problem of detecting P2P botnets, despite a few work claimed to detect centralized botnets effectively. We propose an enhanced PeerHunter, a network-flow level community behavior analysis based system, to detect P2P botnets. Our system starts from a P2P network flow detection component. Then, it uses &#x201c;mutual contacts&#x201d; to cluster bots into communities. Finally, it uses network-flow level community behavior analysis to detect potential botnets. In the experimental evaluation, we propose two evasion attacks, where we assume the adversaries know our techniques in advance and attempt to evade our system by making the P2P bots mimic the behavior of legitimate P2P applications. Our results showed that enhanced PeerHunter can obtain high detection rate with few false positives, and high robustness against the proposed attacks.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A block scrambling-based encryption scheme is presented to enhance the security of Encryption-then-Compression (EtC) systems with JPEG compression, which allow us to securely transmit the images through an untrusted channel provider, such as social network service providers. The proposed scheme enables the use of a smaller block size and a larger number of blocks than the conventional scheme. Images encrypted using the proposed scheme include less color information due to the use of grayscale images even when the original image has three color channels. These features enhance security against various attacks such as jigsaw puzzle solver and brute-force attacks. In an experiment, the security against jigsaw puzzle solver attacks is evaluated. Encrypted images were uploaded to and then downloaded from Facebook and Twitter, and the results demonstrated that the proposed scheme is effective for EtC systems.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Despite the benefits of cyber-insurance, organizations are reluctant to enroll in such policies mainly because of their limitation and high price. On the other hand, insurers are confronting the adverse selection and moral hazard problems as monitoring and distinguishing insureds&#x2019; cybersecurity posture are highly complicated. Considering the organizations&#x2019; security interdependency and their demand for cyber-insurance, we study the design of coalitional insurance mechanisms with the goal of covering the adverse selection, moral hazard, and motivating players for cybersecurity investment and information sharing. To this end, we propose a synergistic insurance framework, where organizations collaboratively insure a common platform instead of themselves. We present three models for insuring a common platform. In the first model, organizations act as both insurer and insured to distribute the risk in the coalition. In the second model, the system provides rewards to crowdfund the insurance. Finally, in the third model, we investigate the outsourcing of a common platform insurance. Furthermore, we discuss how our proposed mechanisms for such framework satisfy the budget balanced, ex ante individual rationality, and incentive compatibility properties. We study how such a system can improve the social welfare by leveraging cyber-insurance as a motivation for organizations to cooperate on the cybersecurity investment and information sharing.

When myriads of resources with similar functionalities are available, effective methodologies are demanded to select services and compose them as service workflows for the specified goals. The computation for workflow composition is very complex since it depends on the numbers of services and their dynamic characteristics. Therefore, composing optimized workflows in a timely manner poses a great challenge. We are highly motivated to reduce the complexity of service selection and composition. The formalized semantics in SWSpec is extended so that unqualified or inferior services can be eliminated directly from the scope of the design solution space. In this paper, a brief review of the proposed SWSpec language is given and the focus is on the sematic formalization. A new compositional proof-system is developed with a set of inference rules and the proven system properties. The proposed semantic formalization has its great significance in reducing the complexity of composing workflows and developing efficient algorithms for compliance checking.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Safety-critical systems implemented on multicore platforms need to satisfy stringent power dissipation constraints such as thermal design power (TDP) thresholds used by chip manufacturers. Power dissipation beyond TDP may trigger dynamic thermal management (DTM) in order to ensure thermal stability of the system. However, the application of DTM makes the system susceptible to higher unpredictability and performance degradations for real-time tasks. This paper proposes a formal scheduler synthesis framework that guarantees adherence to a system level peak power constraint while allowing optimal resource utilization in multicores. Our proposed framework makes use of supervisory control of timed discrete event systems as the underlying formalism. All steps starting from individual models to construction of the scheduler have been implemented through binary decision diagram based symbolic computation, so that the state-space complexity associated with the framework may be controlled. Furthermore, the synthesis framework has been extended to handle tasks with phased execution behavior. Conducted experiments have shown promising results and indicate to the practical efficacy of our approach.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Uncertainty management is a challenging task in decision making of the operators of the power systems. Prediction of the system state is vital for the operation of a system with stochastic behavior especially in a power system with a significant amount of renewable energies such as wind power. Predictable power systems are in more interest of operators, of course. This paper proposes a multiobjective framework for optimal placement and parameters setting of a unified power flow controller (UPFC) considering system predictability. The well-known multiobjective nondominated sorting genetic algorithm is implemented to handle various objective functions such as active power losses and predictability of system in the presence of operational constraints and uncertainties. The point estimate method is used for modeling probabilistic nature of the wind power. Using the proposed method, statistical information of voltage magnitude and apparent power of converters of UPFCs can be obtained, which are very useful in making decision on the sizing of UPFCs. Comprehensive discussions are provided using the simulations on the IEEE 57-bus test system. Also, in order to validate the obtained results, a multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm is implemented and the results of two algorithms are compared with each other.

<p>Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation is a technique that is being used increasingly in the development and test of complex systems. Real-world testing of an intricate system in a field-like power plant can be challenging, time-consuming, expensive, and hazardous. HIL emulators allow engineers to test devices thoroughly and efficiently in a virtual environment with high reliability and minimum risk of defect. In this paper, the complete electric power system (including generator, turbine-governor, excitation system, transmission lines, transformer, external grid and related loads) is implemented in a MATLAB&#x002f;Simulink environment. Different virtual instrument pages are modeled in the graphical programming language of LabVIEW which enable fast and reliable measurement functions such as data acquisition, archiving, real-time graphical display and processing. The interaction between MATLAB and LabVIEW is accomplished by generating a Pharlap ETS Targets <sup>&#x002a;</sup>.dll file which enables the two software to exchange real-time data. Also, a real 1518-kW excitation system is considered as a test case for the introduced HIL system. This equipment is connected to LabVIEW software through a National Instrument PXI technology. Different scenarios (electrical frequency&#x002f;active power change, voltage step response, etc.) are simulated in the designed power system emulator (PSE). The validity of the implemented model for the excitation system is verified by finding good matching between MATLAB and HIL simulation results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are considered as a promising solution in intravehicle networking to reduce wiring and production costs. This application requires reliable and real-time data delivery, while the network is very dense. The time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) mode of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard provides a reliable solution for low-power networks through guaranteed medium access and channel diversity. However, satisfying the stringent requirements of in-vehicle networks is challenging and demands for special consideration in network formation and TSCH scheduling. This paper targets convergecast in dense in-vehicle WSNs, in which all nodes can potentially directly reach the sink node. A cross-layer low-latency topology management and TSCH scheduling (LLTT) technique is proposed that provides a very high timeslot utilization for the TSCH schedule and minimizes communication latency. It first picks a topology for the network that increases the potential of parallel TSCH communications. Then, by using an optimized graph isomorphism algorithm, it extracts a proper match in the physical connectivity graph of the network for the selected topology. This network topology is used by a lightweight TSCH schedule generator to provide low data delivery latency. Two techniques, namely grouped retransmission and periodic aggregation, are exploited to increase the performance of the TSCH communications. The experimental results show that LLTT reduces the end-to-end communication latency compared to other approaches, while keeping the communications reliable by using dedicated links and grouped retransmissions.

<p>In this paper, the influence of the flat and cap secondary, which are usually applied in the linear metro system on transverse forces of linear induction motors, is calculated and analyzed. First, the cap-aluminum plate and lamination back iron of the cap secondary caused relative difficulty in the analytical calculation. Then, the equivalent of the cap-aluminum plate and lamination back iron is presented, and two equivalent coefficients are obtained. The two types of the asymmetry are discussed and the different magnetic motive forces are presented. Second, the analytical model and the method of the linear induction motor are presented. Third, for a cap secondary in practice, the two equivalent coefficients are calculated and discussed. Then, the flat and cap secondary are applied, and the different transverse forces are calculated and analyzed. For two types of the secondaries, the different eddy currents and air-gap flux densities are compared. Finally, the test workbench is built and the analytical result of the transverse force is experimentally validated. It shows that cap secondary has less influence on the railcar when the transverse displacement occurs.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes and investigates an innovative methodology that can have a significant impact on the market potential of wound field, small&#x2013;medium size synchronous generators (SGs). The technique proposed here is aimed at removing the need for the traditional stator skewing that is so commonly used in SGs to achieve acceptable values of voltage total harmonic distortion. To do this, a nonstandard damper cage configuration is proposed that comprises modulation of the damper bars&#x2019; positioning. An off-the-shelf, 400-kVA generator is used as a benchmark machine. Its rotor is optimized and modified according to the proposed technique. The results of the final machine are then compared to the benchmark machine highlighting the excellent advantages that can be achieved through this technique. A full-scale prototype of the modified generator is then built to experimentally validate the concept. Finally, a detailed analysis on all the performance aspects of the prototype is carried out, to guarantee that the proposed technique has no negative impact whatsoever on the generator&#x0027;s performance.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Model-predictive current control (MPCC) is a promising candidate for modular multilevel converter (MMC) control due to its advantages of direct modeling and fast dynamic response. The conventional MPCC, which obtains the optimal control input by evaluating a cost function for all the possible switching states, may make the MPCC impractical due to the exponentially increasing computation burden with the increasing number of submodules (SMs). On the other hand, the MPCC experiences high load current and circulating current tracking errors, since only one switching state is selected and applied during one control period. To address these issues, this paper proposes an MPCC with phase-shifted pulsewidth modulation (PS-PWM) for improving the steady-state control performance. The arm voltages are considered as a whole to implement the proposed MPCC. The optimal duty cycle is obtained based on the load and circulating current tracking error minimization and applied using the PS-PWM. As a result, the computation burden is unrelated to the number of SMs by avoiding the exhaustive evaluation process for all the possible switching states. A better steady-state performance with smaller tracking errors is achieved with the similar switching frequency, and the tedious tuning process of the weighting factor is eliminated. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPCC.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A nonisolated bidirectional dc&#x2013;dc converter with high voltage gain, low voltage stress, low component count, and soft-switching features is presented in this paper. In this topology, coupled inductors and voltage multiplier cells are merged to achieve high step-up&#x002f;down voltage gain. Also, due to using active clamp circuits, the voltage stress of power switches is relatively low. Thus, the low voltage switches with low on-resistance can be employed to reduce the conduction losses. Furthermore, zero-voltage switching is accomplished in both high step-up and high step-down modes for all power switches, and due to zero-current switching operation of all antiparallel diodes, the reverse recovery losses are reduced. In order to verify the theoretical analysis and the converter performance, a 200 W prototype circuit of the proposed converter is implemented in the laboratory.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the continuously broadening application area of Internet of Things (IoT), robust energy harvesters and power conditioning units for supplying remote sensors and actuators are gaining importance. A single-sided linear induction machine (SLIM) with solid secondary operating in generator mode could meet these requirements as it can harvest electric energy from the kinetic energy of a moving conductive body (secondary). Therefore, the energy harvesting performance of SLIMs is studied in this paper, using analytical models, which are derived with special attention to the case where a conductive coating is applied on the mover&#x2014;a simple and practical modification that is shown to increase the harvester performance significantly. Measurements are given for three different secondary materials and stator geometries. It is shown that 15 W of electrical power can be harvested with $text{14}%$ efficiency over an air gap of 0.5 mm from a copper-coated steel mover with a surface speed of 29 m/s, covering only $text{17 cm}^{text{2}}$ of the surface area.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Using multi-atlas registration (MAR), information carried by atlases can be transferred onto a new input image for the tasks of region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation, anatomical landmark detection, and so on. Conventional atlases used in MAR methods are monomodal and contain only normal anatomical structures. Therefore, the majority of MAR methods cannot handle input multimodal pathological images, which are often collected in routine image-based diagnosis. This is because registering monomodal atlases with normal appearances to multimodal pathological images involves two major problems: 1) missing imaging modalities in the monomodal atlases and 2) influence from pathological regions. In this paper, we propose a new MAR framework to tackle these problems. In this framework, deep learning-based image synthesizers are applied for synthesizing multimodal normal atlases from conventional monomodal normal atlases. To reduce the influence from pathological regions, we further propose a multimodal low-rank approach to recover multimodal normal-looking images from multimodal pathological images. Finally, the multimodal normal atlases can be registered to the recovered multimodal images in a multi-channel way. We evaluate our MAR framework via brain ROI segmentation of multimodal tumor brain images. Due to the utilization of multimodal information and the reduced influence from pathological regions, experimental results show that registration based on our method is more accurate and robust, leading to significantly improved brain ROI segmentation compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Stereoscopic saliency detection plays an important role in various stereoscopic video processing applications. However, conventional stereoscopic video saliency detection methods mainly use independent low-level features instead of extracting them automatically, and thus, they ignore the intrinsic relationship between the spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel stereoscopic video saliency detection method based on 3D convolutional neural networks, namely, deep 3D video saliency (Deep3DSaliency). The proposed network consists of two sub-models: spatiotemporal saliency model (STSM) and stereoscopic saliency aware model (SSAM). STSM directly takes three consecutive video frames as the input to extract visual spatiotemporal features, while SSAM attempts to further infer the depth and semantic features from the left and right video frames by shared parameters from STSM. The visual spatiotemporal features from STSM and the depth and semantic features from SSAM are learned by an alternating optimization scheme. Finally, all these saliency-related features are combined together for the final stereoscopic saliency detection via 3D deconvolution. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed model over other existing ones in saliency estimation for 3D video sequences.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Traditional image quality assessment (IQA) methods do not perform robustly due to the shallow hand-designed features. It has been demonstrated that deep neural network can learn more effective features than ever. In this paper, we describe a new deep neural network to predict the image quality accurately without relying on the reference image. To learn more effective feature representations for non-reference IQA, we propose a two-stream convolution network that includes two subcomponents for image and gradient image. The motivation for this design is using a two-stream scheme to capture different-level information of inputs and easing the difficulty of extracting features from one steam. The gradient stream focuses on extracting structure features in details, and the image stream pays more attention to the information in intensity. In addition, to consider the locally non-uniform distribution of distortion in images, we add a region-based fully convolutional layer for using the information around the center of the input image patch. The final score of the overall image is calculated by averaging of the patch scores. The proposed network performs in an end-to-end manner in both the training and testing phases. The experimental results on a series of benchmark datasets, e.g., LIVE, CISQ, IVC, TID2013, and Waterloo Exploration Database, show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which verifies the effectiveness of our network architecture.
