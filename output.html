<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In public cloud storage services, data are outsourced to semi-trusted cloud servers which are outside of data owners&#x2019; trusted domain. To prevent untrustworthy service providers from accessing data owners&#x2019; sensitive data, outsourced data are often encrypted. In this scenario, conducting access control over these data becomes a challenging issue. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) has been proved to be a powerful cryptographic tool to express access policies over attributes, which can provide a fine-grained, flexible, and secure access control over outsourced data. However, the existing ABE-based access control schemes do not support users to gain access permission by collaboration. In this paper, we explore a special attribute-based access control scenario where multiple users having different attribute sets can collaborate to gain access permission if the data owner allows their collaboration in the access policy. Meanwhile, the collaboration that is not designated in the access policy should be regarded as a collusion and the access request will be denied. We propose an attribute-based controlled collaborative access control scheme through designating translation nodes in the access structure. Security analysis shows that our proposed scheme can guarantee data confidentiality and has many other critical security properties. Extensive performance analysis shows that our proposed scheme is efficient in terms of storage and computation overhead.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Noise estimation is crucial in many image processing tasks, such as denoising. Most of the existing noise estimation methods are specially developed for grayscale images. For color images, these methods simply handle each color channel independently, without considering the correlation across channels. Moreover, these methods often assume a globally fixed noise model throughout the entire image, neglecting the adaptation to the local structures. In this paper, we propose a content-adaptive multivariate Gaussian approach to model the noise in color images, in which we explicitly consider both the content-dependence and the inter-dependence among color channels. We design an effective method for estimating the noise covariance matrices within the proposed model. Specifically, a patch selection scheme is first introduced to select the weakly textured patches via thresholding the texture strength indicators. Noticing that the patch selection actually depends on the unknown noise covariance, we present an iterative noise covariance estimation algorithm, where the patch selection and the covariance estimation are conducted alternately. For the remaining textured regions, we estimate a distinct covariance matrix associated with each pixel using a linear shrinkage estimator, which adaptively fuses the estimate coming from the weakly textured region and the sample covariance estimated from the local region. The experimental results show that our method can effectively estimate the noise covariance. The usefulness of our method is demonstrated with several image processing applications, such as color image denoising and noise-robust superpixel.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents an improved pulsewidth modulation strategy in conjunction with an optimal compensator for fast capacitor voltage balancing in three-level neutral-point-clamped (NPC) inverter. The voltage balancing compensator is designed in such a way that it produces optimal unbalance compensation coefficient according to the inherent limitations related to the variability range of modulating signals. It generates maximum compensating neutral current for the full modulation depth extending into overmodulation region and throughout the entire range of load power factor angles, and thus improves the unbalance compensation ability for all the operating conditions of the inverter. The optimal compensation offset signal corresponding to each operating point is determined from the boundary limit of the auxiliary modulating signals. Particle swarm optimization is applied for such purpose. The performance of the proposed optimal compensator for different combinations of modulation index and load power factors are evaluated through extensive simulation study using Matlab/Simulink and validated in experimentation using a three-level NPC inverter prototype with induction motor load. Finally, the voltage balancing performances of the proposed compensator are compared with that available in literature to confirm the usefulness of the proposed concept.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The two most commonly used induction motor control methods are the scalar (V/f) and vector (field-oriented) control techniques. V/f control has good steadystate response and robustness against the variation in machine parameters, but the resulting torque dynamics are poorer. Vector control achieves better dynamic performance by decoupling the fluxand torque-producing components of the stator current. Vector-controlled techniques are heavily dependent on the machine parameters and are sensitive to the variation in machine parameters. This paper proposes a novel control technique, which integrates the robustness features of scalar control and good dynamic performance of vector control. Estimation of the transient vector is responsible for improving dynamics in the proposed control. The proposed control technique uses an optimal controller with an output feedback law. The operation of the proposed control is validated experimentally under both steady-state and transient conditions. Finally, the proposed control is compared with both the V/f and vector control strategies in terms of dynamic performance and parameter sensitivity.

<p>A high gonorrhoea disease burden, increasing rates, and growing antimicrobial resistance portend a developing global public health crisis.1 Gonorrhoea can cause reproductive complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility, blindness in infants born to infected mothers, and can facilitate HIV acquisition and transmission.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Skeleton-based human action recognition has been a hot topic in recent years. Most existing studies are based on the skeleton data obtained from Kinect, which is noisy and unstable, in particular, in the case of occlusions. To cope with the noisy skeleton data and variation of viewpoints, this paper presents a view-invariant method for human action recognition by recovering the corrupted skeletons based on a 3D bio-constrained skeleton model and visualizing those body-level motion features obtained during the recovery process with images. The bio-constrained skeleton model is defined with two types of constraints: 1) constant bone lengths and 2) motion limits of joints. Based on the bio-constrained model, an effective method is proposed for skeleton recovery. Two types of new motion features, the Euclidean distance matrix between joints (JEDM), which contains the global structure information of the body, and the local dynamic variation of the joint Euler angles (JEAs) are used in describing human action. These two types of features are encoded into different motion images, which are fed into a two-stream convolutional neural network for learning different action patterns. The experiments on three benchmark datasets achieve better accuracy than the state-of-the-art approaches, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel algorithm to reassemble an arbitrarily shredded image to its original status. Existing reassembly pipelines commonly consist of a local matching stage and a global compositions stage. In the local stage, a key challenge is to reliably compute correct pairwise matching, for which most existing algorithms use handcrafted features, and cannot reliably handle complicated puzzles. We build a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect the compatibility of pairwise stitching, and use it to prune computed pairwise matches. To improve the network efficiency and accuracy, we transfer the calculation of CNN to the stitching region and apply a boost training strategy. In the global composition stage, instead of using the widely adopted greedy edge selection strategies, we propose two new loop closure-based searching algorithms. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods on solving various puzzles, especially challenging ones with many fragment pieces.

<p>Sparse coding-based anomaly detection has shown promising performance, of which the keys are feature learning, sparse representation, and dictionary learning. In this paper, we propose a new neural network for anomaly detection (termed AnomalyNet) by deeply achieving feature learning, sparse representation, and dictionary learning in three joint neural processing blocks. Specifically, to learn better features, we design a motion fusion block accompanied by a feature transfer block to enjoy the advantages of eliminating noisy background, capturing motion, and alleviating data deficiency. Furthermore, to address some disadvantages (e.g., nonadaptive updating) of the existing sparse coding optimizers and embrace the merits of neural network (e.g., parallel computing), we design a novel recurrent neural network to learn sparse representation and dictionary by proposing an adaptive iterative hard-thresholding algorithm (adaptive ISTA) and reformulating the adaptive ISTA as a new long short-term memory (LSTM). To the best of our knowledge, this could be one of the first works to bridge the  $ell _{1}$ -solver and LSTM and may provide novel insight into understanding LSTM and model-based optimization (or named differentiable programming), as well as sparse coding-based anomaly detection. Extensive experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of our method in the abnormal events detection task.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Constrained image splicing detection and localization (CISDL), which investigates two input suspected images and identifies whether one image has suspected regions pasted from the other, is a newly proposed challenging task for image forensics. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial learning framework to learn a deep matching network for CISDL. Our framework mainly consists of three building blocks. First, a deep matching network based on atrous convolution (DMAC) aims to generate two high-quality candidate masks, which indicate suspected regions of the two input images. In DMAC, atrous convolution is adopted to extract features with rich spatial information, a correlation layer based on a skip architecture is proposed to capture hierarchical features, and atrous spatial pyramid pooling is constructed to localize tampered regions at multiple scales. Second, a detection network is designed to rectify inconsistencies between the two corresponding candidate masks. Finally, a discriminative network drives the DMAC network to produce masks that are hard to distinguish from ground-truth ones. The detection network and the discriminative network collaboratively supervise the training of DMAC in an adversarial way. Besides, a sliding window-based matching strategy is investigated for high-resolution images matching. Extensive experiments, conducted on five groups of datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the superior performance of DMAC.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Gait is a useful biometric feature for human identification in video surveillance applications since it can be obtained without subject cooperation. In recent years, model-based gait recognition using a 3D skeleton has been widely studied through view-invariant modeling and kinematic gait analysis. However, existing methods integrate all frame-level feature vectors using the same criterion, even though skeleton information is highly sensitive to changes in covariate conditions such as clothing, carrying, and occlusion. The scheme inevitably reduces the frame-level discriminative power and eventually degrades performance. Instead, we propose a robust frame-level matching method for gait recognition that minimizes the influence of noisy patterns as well as secures the frame-level discriminative power. To this end, we measure the skeleton quality in terms of body symmetry for each frame. Based on the quality, we construct a quality-adjusted cost matrix between input frames and registered frames to prevent matching with noisy patterns. Our two-stage linear matching is then applied to the cost matrix to compute a frame-level discriminative score including similarity and margin. In the end, the identity of a probe is determined by a weighted majority voting scheme via frame-level scores. It enhances the robustness against inaccurate skeleton estimation results by assigning different weights for each frame based on the score. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets (UPCVgait, UPCVgaitK2, and SDUgait) and a new gait dataset which we create with consideration of unpredictable behaviors while walking. In addition, we demonstrate that our method is robust to skeleton estimation error, partial occlusion, and data loss. The CILgait dataset and MATLAB code are available at https://sites.google.com/site/seokeonchoi/gait-recognition.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a frequency diverse array-based directional modulation with artificial noise synthesis scheme is proposed to enhance the physical layer security of wireless communications. We aim to optimize the secrecy performance by jointly optimizing the frequency offsets, the beamforming vector, and the artificial-noise projection matrix (ANPM). Specifically, we address the physical layer security problems for known locations of proximal eavesdropper (Eve) and legitimate user (LU). The beamforming vector and frequency offsets are designed to preserve the signal power at LU. The ANPM is calculated to minimize the effect of AN on LU. Furthermore, we extend our approach to the case of multi-LUs with unknown Eve locations. Being different from the case of a single LU, the frequency offsets across array antennas are optimized to equally allocate transmitted power to each LU. The numerical results show that the proposed method can provide a higher secrecy performance than conventional DM methods. In the case of multi-LUs with unknown Eve locations, the proposed method can provide a high secrecy capacity while achieving almost equal achievable capacity to each LU.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deblurring is a fundamental inverse problem in bioimaging. It requires modeling the point spread function (PSF), which captures the optical distortions entailed by the image formation process. The PSF limits the spatial resolution attainable for a given microscope. However, recent applications require a higher resolution and have prompted the development of super-resolution techniques to achieve sub-pixel accuracy. This requirement restricts the class of suitable PSF models to analog ones. In addition, deblurring is computationally intensive, hence further requiring computationally efficient models. A custom candidate fitting both the requirements is the Gaussian model. However, this model cannot capture the rich tail structures found in both the theoretical and empirical PSFs. In this paper, we aim at improving the reconstruction accuracy beyond the Gaussian model, while preserving its computational efficiency. We introduce a new class of analog PSF models based on the Gaussian mixtures. The number of Gaussian kernels controls both the modeling accuracy and the computational efficiency of the model: the lower the number of kernels, the lower the accuracy and the higher the efficiency. To explore the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, we propose a variational formulation of the PSF calibration problem, where a convex sparsity-inducing penalty on the number of Gaussian kernels allows trading accuracy for efficiency. We derive an efficient algorithm based on a fully split formulation of alternating split Bregman. We assess our framework on synthetic and real data, and demonstrate a better reconstruction accuracy in both geometry and photometry in point source localization&#x2014;a fundamental inverse problem in fluorescence microscopy.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent years have witnessed the success of deep convolutional neural networks for image classification and many related tasks. It should be pointed out that the existing training strategies assume that there is a clean dataset for model learning. In elaborately constructed benchmark datasets, deep network has yielded promising performance under the assumption. However, in real-world applications, it is burdensome and expensive to collect sufficient clean training samples. On the other hand, collecting noisy labeled samples is very economical and practical, especially with the rapidly increasing amount of visual data in the web. Unfortunately, the accuracy of current deep models may drop dramatically even with 5&#x0025;&#x2013;10&#x0025; label noise. Therefore, enabling label noise resistant classification has become a crucial issue in the data driven deep learning approaches. In this paper, we propose a DEep COnfiDEnce network (DECODE) to address this issue. In particular, based on the distribution of mislabeled data, we adopt a confidence evaluation module that is able to determine the confidence that a sample is mislabeled. With the confidence, we further use a weighting strategy to assign different weights to different samples so that the model pays less attention to low confidence data, which is more likely to be noise. In this way, the deep model is more robust to label noise. DECODE is designed to be general, such that it can be easily combined with existing studies. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets, and the results validate that DECODE can improve the accuracy of deep models trained with noisy data.

<p>Automated production systems are critical enablers for Industry 4.0 because these design-to-order, custom-built mechatronic systems are not only capable of delivering automation capabilities to satisfy the stakeholder requirements in the manufacturing/production domain, but doing so for a long period of time (e.g., several decades) during which numerous changing needs shall also be accounted for. Although traceability has long been recognized as key to sustain changes, little is known about how the traceability information is managed in place, i.e., in the native environments where the engineering artifacts reside. We contribute in this paper a survey of traceability support within state-of-the-practice tools: seven for programming logic controllers and six for building models in systems modeling language. We draw the similarities and differences from our survey results, and further present a design by leveraging the in-place traceability to better support the development and evolution of automated production systems.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a variable structure speed controller (VSSC) that guarantees the robust transient performance against the external disturbances and parameter uncertainties of an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive. Unlike the conventional VSSC applied to the IPMSMs, the proposed nonlinear compensating control term not only assures the robustness against the system uncertainties, but also implements the maximum torque per ampere technique. Furthermore, the convergence and stability of the proposed VSSC are fully proven through the Lyapunov theory by introducing reasonable bounded uncertainties which determine a feasible range for the system dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is investigated through the simulation using MATLAB/Simulink and experiment using a prototype IPMSM drive system with a TI TMS320F28335 DSP. Finally, the proposed VSSC can ensure faster and more robust transient response than the conventional proportional-integral speed controller under the dynamic load conditions including the uncertainties.

<p>Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is revolutionizing the retail industry for manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers to improve operational efficiency and consumer experience. In IIoT-enabled retail marketing, reputation systems play a critical role to boost mutual trust among industrial entities and build consumer confidence. In this paper, we focus on reputation management in the consumer&#x2013;retailer channel, where retailers can accumulate reputations from consumer feedbacks. To encourage consumers to post feedbacks without worrying about being tracked or retaliated, we propose an anonymous reputation system that preserves consumer identities and individual review confidentialities. To increase system transparency and reliability, we further exploit the tamper-proof nature and the distributed consensus mechanism of the blockchain technology. With system designs based on various cryptographic primitives and a Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol, our blockchain-based reputation system is more efficient to offer high levels of privacy guarantees compared with existing ones. Finally, we explore the implementation challenges of the blockchain-based architecture and present a proof-of-concept prototype system by Parity Ethereum. We measure the on/off-chain performance with the scalability discussion to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Applying consortium blockchain as a trust layer for heterogeneous industrial Internet-of-Things devices is cost-effective. However, with an increase in computing power, some powerful attacks (e.g., the 51&#x0025; attack) are inevitable and will cause severe consequences. Recent studies also confirm that anonymity and immutability of blockchain have been abused to facilitate black market trades, etc. To operate controllable blockchain for IIoT devices, it is necessary to rewrite blockchain history back to a normal state once the chain is breached. Ateniese et al. proposed redactable blockchain by using chameleon hash (CH) to replace traditional hash function, it allows blockchain history to be written when needed (EuroS&amp;P 2017). However, we cannot apply this idea directly to IIoT without solving the following problems: (1) achieve a decentralized design of CH; (2) update the signatures accordingly to authenticate the redacted contents; (3) satisfy the low-computing need of the individual IIoT device. In this paper, we overcome the above issues by proposing the first threshold chameleon hash (TCH) and accountable-and-sanitizable chameleon signature (ASCS) schemes. Based on them, we build a redactable consortium blockchain which is efficient for IIoT devices to operate. It allows a group of authorized sensors to write and rewrite blockchain without causing any hard forks. Basically, TCH is the first TCH and ASCS is a public-key signature supporting file-level and block-level modifications of signatures without impairing authentications. Additionally, ASCS achieves accountability to avoid abuse of redaction. While security analysis validates our proposals, the simulation results show that redaction is acceptably efficient if it is executed at a small scale or if we adopt a coarse-grained redaction while sacrificing some securities.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the automated demand response (DR) problem in smart grids equipped with information and communication technology networks, where power generating and consuming units can exchange information as a multiagent system (MAS), and a real-time pricing (RTP) scheme is proposed. When the communication graph among agents is connected, a novel parallel and distributed consensus-based algorithm is proposed to derive an RTP scheme to facilitate DR, and when communication uncertainties exist, a robust consensus algorithm is proposed to cease the effect of uncertainties. Next, this paper proposes a novel control mechanism to tackle the problem of disconnected communication among agents, e.g., under cyber-attacks, by employing the so-called mixed communication-broadcast control architecture where the underlying ideas are twofold. First, each area in the grid associated with a connected subgraph is controlled by a MAS to guarantee the power balance and to reach consensus on the local electric price for that area. Second, a supervisory unit observes those local electric prices to calculate the global electric price for the whole grid and then broadcasts to all units so that they can properly adjust their output powers. Simulations are carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system to validate the proposed control mechanisms.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents an electric arc furnace (EAF) optimization framework intended to define optimal control profiles for the EAF, in order to increase its efficiency and thus reduce the energy consumption. The framework aims to minimize controllable losses and to maximize energy transfer to the bath and, consequently, minimize the operational costs. This is achieved through improved actuation of the EAF inputs, i.e., transformer power, oxygen lancing, and carbon addition. To achieve maximal energy transfer to the bath and to reduce the heat losses from the arcs, proper properties of the slag, such as foaminess and basicity, are a subject of considerable attention. The framework is designed as a model-based optimization, intended to be executed online in parallel to the actual EAF process. In order to achieve sufficiently low computational complexity and to allow process optimization by arbitrary time intervals, the framework uses path constraints instead of end-point constraints. A combination of several optimization algorithms is used to solve the optimization problem. The validation of the framework was performed by comparing the predicted and the measured operational variables. Simulation results show that optimized operation profiles lead to a significant decrease in operational costs and production times.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>High control bandwidth is usually restricted in a finite sampling rate of a charge-coupled device (CCD)-based tracking loop, which hinders a good closed-loop performance. Conventionally, a rate feedforward controller is usually used to improve the control performance; however, it is restricted by the line-of-sight (LOS) rate, which is required to be estimated due to only the LOS error available in the CCD-based tracking control system. Besides that, it is also affected by the inverse of the control model. A new error-based feedforward (EBF) control mode is proposed to overcome these difficulties. Due to being plugged into an existing feedback control loop, the closed-loop performance of the CCD-based control system can be minimized by optimizing a Q-filter. The closed-loop stability and robustness with this EBF control system are investigated on the condition of the gain margin and the phase margin of the open-loop transfer function. Furthermore, this paper proposes a new criterion to enhance the robustness of the EBF control system and reveals the sensitivity function property. Because of not being restricted by an accurate model, this new feedforward controller cannot lead to a compromise between error attenuation and noise propagation in the control loop. Simulations and experiments are both used to testify the effectiveness of the improved control mode.
