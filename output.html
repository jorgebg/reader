<div class="itemdescription">
<p><span class="paragraphSection">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common chronic conditions contributing to morbidity and mortality. In 2016, it was the third leading cause of years of life lost and diasbility-adjusted life-years in the United States, with an estimated 164&#8239;000 deaths. Even with aggressive inpatient management, patients who are hospitalized for COPD often experience a recurrent cycle of rehospitalizations, resulting in reductions in overall health and quality of life (QOL). To help interrupt this cycle, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services incorporated COPD into the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program, which financially penalizes hospitals with high risk-adjusted readmissions. The ensuing interest in COPD readmissions has generated numerous clinical trials that have examined different readmission reduction strategies, although this research has often produced conflicting results, and many studies have failed to demonstrate benefit of transitional care or chronic disease self-management programs. Clinicians and health systems are left with limited guidance for how to manage this common disease.</span>

<p>Scientists at the University of W&#252;rzburg have been able to boost current super-resolution microscopy by a novel tweak. They coated the glass cover slip as part of the sample carrier with tailor-made biocompatible nanosheets that create a 'mirror effect'. This method shows that localizing single emitters in front of a metal-dielectric coating leads to higher precision, brightness and contrast in Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM). The study was published in the Nature journal Light: Science and Applications.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A microgrid may comprise several zones with local loads and distributed generation resources. If a fault occurs in a zone, then a static switch between the faulty and fault-free zones must be activated to detect/classify the faults and enable the breaker to open the circuit immediately. This paper presents a new method for designing a detection/classification module in a static switch using the Park Transform (PT), Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) and Takagi&#x2013;Sugeno&#x2013;Kang (TSK) fuzzy rules. Both wavelet coefficients/energies of the d-axis component, within 0.96&#x2013;1.92 kHz, obtained by MRA and PT are employed to effectively detect and classify the fault types using the local fault signals near the static switch without a complicated communication system. The proposed TSK fuzzy rules, defined by the scenario data only, successfully classify the faults. The proposed method is verified by hardware-in-the-loop simulation using a real-time digital simulator and a realistic 5 kVA static switch. The proposed method is implemented in a Xilinx field-programmable gate array. Test results show that the proposed method is efficient in the real-time control environment of a microgrid.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Regarding the potentials of activating commercial consumers in demand response programs, this paper proposes a new framework for energy scheduling of an active distribution network based on the concept of technical virtual power plant (TVPP), considering operational constraints of distribution network. The TVPP enables presence of commercial buildings and other distributed energy resources in day-ahead (DA) electricity market, as a price maker agent. In this regard, a bilevel optimization framework is designed to optimize the bidding strategy of TVPP in the DA market with the main goal of maximizing TVPP profit. The upper-level problem maximizes the TVPP profit, while in the lower level, market is cleared from independent system operator viewpoint. Using Karush&#x2014;Kuhn&#x2013;Tucker optimality conditions and strong duality theory, the proposed bilevel problem is transformed into mixed integer linear programming problem. Implementing the model on the Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS) test system demonstrates the applicability of the proposed model.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A stability index has been generally used in a gait system of formulaic structure. In this standardized structure, a human model has a center of gravity (COG), while a robot device has a zero moment point (ZMP) with COG as the stability standard in the walking motion. In the gait system of wearable type, the stability of human model is closely related with the robot device, in other words, the COG and ZMP are located in the limited domain of human motion and robot task. In this paper, the human and device are designed individually and the knee joint of human is unconstrained from the device work to allow the human reliance. The stability index that includes the COG and ZMP is defined. The validation of this index is guaranteed through a few tests to describe a correlation between the stability index and the human model condition. Based on the validity of the stability index, the experiment for the walking stabilization is implemented with the ZMP estimation by reaction torque observer.

<p>The COAST-V study published by D&#233;sir&#233;e van der Heijde and colleagues in The Lancet1 shows that ixekizumab, a monoclonal antibody that selectively targets interleukin (IL)-17A, is efficacious in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (also known as radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) who have previously been untreated with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). Ixekizumab has already followed the other IL-17A antibody, secukinumab, in two other indications, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and it seems likely that an approval for radiographic axial spondyloarthritis will follow on the basis of the evidence provided in this Article.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Even the most colourless clinical description of schistosomiasis comes across like a pitch for an early David Lynch body horror. Waterborne flatworm larvae penetrate the skin, and move in the bloodstream through the heart and lungs to the liver. Here they mature and mate in the portal circulation, before laying eggs that lodge in the liver&#8212;occasionally the spinal cord or genitals&#8212;or leave the body via the bladder or intestinal walls. The framing of schistosomiasis as a parasitic tropical disease emerged from a series of global encounters&#8212;between medicine and science, between industrial nations competing for dominance, and between imperial governments and their indigenous subjects.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A procedure to calculate maximum torque operating conditions for the inverter-fed induction machine is proposed in this paper. The proposed procedure minimizes the finite-element analysis computation load by identifying the variation range of stator current and slip frequency for the entire torque-speed map. Thus, the total calculation time for machine steady-state performance estimation can be significantly reduced. The effectiveness of the proposed procedure is validated by an experiment.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In the near future, plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) will dominate the car market. The peak-valley difference would increase greatly due to the random nature of PEVs charging behaviors. In this paper, a new problem on studying the dynamic economic/emission dispatch (DEED) including PEVs for peak shaving and valley filling is proposed, and furthermore, the effect caused by different vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) loads on DEED is analyzed. The optimization model of the problem is constructed including several practical constraints, such as power flow constraints and ramp rate limits. The battery degradation cost is also included, which reshapes the objective function of DEED. Based on the model, a strategy for DEED including PEVs for peak shaving and valley filling is given, and a multiobjective optimization algorithm is adopted to solve the proposed problem. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy, three DEED cases are considered under different V2G power. The analysis of the effect on fuel cost and emission caused by different V2G power shows that the proposed strategy can effectively reduce the emission and cut down the investment in peak load plants.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a decoupled power control strategy for a modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based hybrid ac&#x2013;dc grid integrated with a hybrid energy storage system. This system can mitigate the active power fluctuations caused by intermittent renewable generation and also realize reactive power compensation as required by voltage regulation. The proposed hybrid ac&#x2013;dc system has a novel configuration in which batteries and supercapacitors are distributed into the upper arm and the lower arm of the MMC, respectively. Therefore, it is possible to design fully decoupled power control and simultaneously optimize the performances of batteries and supercapacitors. First, the system modeling and operational principles of the MMC are briefly introduced in this paper. On the basis of these analyses, the power decoupling between the upper arm and the lower arm is presented to realize different control objectives. Moreover, battery state-of-charge balancing control and supercapacitor voltage control are also presented, which are crucial for ensuring the normal operation of these energy storage components and the proposed MMC-based hybrid ac&#x2013;dc grid. Finally, the proposed system and its control strategies are verified by laboratory experimental results.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel approach for detection of stator short-circuit faults in three-phase induction motors. The method is based on two stages: feature extraction and classification by intelligent systems. First, mutual information is estimated from delayed stator current signals, which are used as inputs of C4.5 decision trees and multilayer perceptron neural networks in the second step. Several offline and online experimental tests are presented considering voltage unbalance, load torque variations, and 1&#x0025; to 10&#x0025; short-circuit levels.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This letter proposes a novel multipulse rectifier. The proposed rectifier is a combination of a novel dual-passive-harmonic-reduction method and a traditional double-star uncontrolled rectifier. The proposed method contains a multiwinding interphase reactor (IPR) and the corresponding auxiliary circuit. From the viewpoint of minimizing the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the input line current, the turn ratio of the multiwinding IPR is optimally designed. Under the optimal turn ratio, the proposed rectifier operates as an 18-pulse rectifier. Its theoretical THD of the input line current is about 10.1&#x0025;, and its experimental THD is 6.58&#x0025;. The proposed method is simple and easy to realize.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Lung cancer is the type of cancer that most often kills after the initial diagnosis. To aid the specialist in its diagnosis, temporal evaluation is a potential tool for analyzing indeterminate lesions, which may be benign or malignant, during treatment. With this goal in mind, a methodology is herein proposed for the analysis, quantification, and visualization of changes in lung lesions. This methodology uses a modified version of the quality threshold clustering algorithm to associate each voxel of the lesion to a cluster, and changes in the lesion over time are defined in terms of voxel moves to another cluster. In addition, statistical features are extracted for classification of the lesion as benign or malignant. To develop the proposed methodology, two databases of pulmonary lesions were used, one for malignant lesions in treatment (public) and the other for indeterminate cases (private). We determined that the density change percentage varied from 6.22&#x0025; to 36.93&#x0025; of lesion volume in the public database of malignant lesions under treatment and from 19.98&#x0025; to 38.81&#x0025; in the private database of lung nodules. Additionally, other inter-cluster density change measures were obtained. These measures indicate the degree of change in the clusters and how each of them is abundant in relation to volume. From the statistical analysis of regions in which the density changes occurred, we were able to discriminate lung lesions with an accuracy of 98.41&#x0025;, demonstrating that these changes can indicate the true nature of the lesion. In addition to visualizing the density changes occurring in lesions over time, we quantified these changes and analyzed the entire set through volumetry, which is the technique most commonly used to analyze changes in pulmonary lesions.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Metaheuristic techniques have shown remarkable performance in a vast variety of engineering problems. Accurate solving of nonlinear equation set in selective harmonic elimination (SHE) has been one of the widely discussed numerical problems in power electronics. Current study aims at conducting an inclusive comparison of prominent stochastic methods adopted for SHE and modified SHE (MSHE) pulse width modulation techniques. The problem is defined as finding local optima of cascaded H-bride converter operation parameters. The survey investigates key indices of low-order harmonic components and weighted total harmonic distortion. Floating fundamental component is introduced for SHE and MSHE to achieve higher rate of flexibility for optimization techniques. Finally, an advanced modulation technique is proposed to address the dc-link voltage ripples. Simulation and experimental results are presented as a proof of concept.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is used for the first time to detect fabricated defects in a glass fiber-skinned lightweight honeycomb composite panel. A novel amplitude polynomial regression (APR) algorithm is proposed as a preprocessing method. This method segments the amplitude&#x2013;frequency curves to simulate the heating and the cooling monotonic behavior as in infrared thermography. Then, the method of empirical orthogonal function (EOF) imaging is applied on the APR preprocessed data as a postprocessing algorithm. Signal-to-noise ratio analysis is performed to verify the image improvement of the proposed APR-EOF modality from a quantitative point of view. Finally, the experimental results and the physical analysis show that THz is more suitable with respect to the detection of defects in glass fiber lightweight honeycomb composites.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Retrieving specific persons with various types of queries, e.g., a set of attributes or a portrait photo has great application potential in large-scale intelligent surveillance systems. In this paper, we propose a richly annotated pedestrian (RAP) dataset which serves as a unified benchmark for both attribute-based and image-based person retrieval in real surveillance scenarios. Typically, previous datasets have three improvable aspects, including limited data scale and annotation types, heterogeneous data source, and controlled scenarios. Differently, RAP is a large-scale dataset which contains 84928 images with 72 types of attributes and additional tags of viewpoint, occlusion, body parts, and 2589 person identities. It is collected in the real uncontrolled scene and has complex visual variations in pedestrian samples due to the change of viewpoints, pedestrian postures, and cloth appearance. Towards a high-quality person retrieval benchmark, an amount of state-of-the-art algorithms on pedestrian attribute recognition and person re-identification (ReID), are performed for quantitative analysis with three evaluation tasks, i.e., attribute recognition, attribute-based and image-based person retrieval, where a new instance-based metric is proposed to measure the dependency of the prediction of multiple attributes. Finally, some interesting problems, e.g., the joint feature learning of attribute recognition and ReID, and the problem of cross-day person ReID, are explored to show the challenges and future directions in person retrieval.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Depth information is being widely used in many real-world applications. However, due to the limitation of depth sensing technology, the captured depth map in practice usually has much lower resolution than that of color image counterpart. In this paper, we propose to combine the internal smoothness prior and external gradient consistency constraint in graph domain for depth super-resolution. On one hand, a new graph Laplacian regularizer is proposed to preserve the inherent piecewise smooth characteristic of depth, which has desirable filtering properties. A specific weight matrix of the respect graph is defined to make full use of information of both depth and the corresponding guidance image. On the other hand, inspired by an observation that the gradient of depth is small except at edge separating regions, we introduce a graph gradient consistency constraint to enforce that the graph gradient of depth is close to the thresholded gradient of guidance. We reinterpret the gradient thresholding model as variational optimization with sparsity constraint. In this way, we remedy the problem of structure discrepancy between depth and guidance. Finally, the internal and external regularizations are casted into a unified optimization framework, which can be efficiently addressed by ADMM. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art with respect to both objective and subjective quality evaluations.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Image annotation aims to annotate a given image with a variable number of class labels corresponding to diverse visual concepts. In this paper, we address two main issues in large-scale image annotation: 1) how to learn a rich feature representation suitable for predicting a diverse set of visual concepts ranging from object, scene to abstract concept and 2) how to annotate an image with the optimal number of class labels. To address the first issue, we propose a novel multi-scale deep model for extracting rich and discriminative features capable of representing a wide range of visual concepts. Specifically, a novel two-branch deep neural network architecture is proposed, which comprises a very deep main network branch and a companion feature fusion network branch designed for fusing the multi-scale features computed from the main branch. The deep model is also made multi-modal by taking noisy user-provided tags as model input to complement the image input. For tackling the second issue, we introduce a label quantity prediction auxiliary task to the main label prediction task to explicitly estimate the optimal label number for a given image. Extensive experiments are carried out on two large-scale image annotation benchmark datasets, and the results show that our method significantly outperforms the state of the art.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Random walk is a popular and efficient algorithm for image segmentation, especially for extracting regions of interest (ROIs). One difficulty with the random walk algorithm is the requirement for solving a huge sparse linear system when applied to large images. Another limitation is its sensitivity to seeds distribution, i.e., the segmentation result depends on the number of seeds as well as their placement, which puts a burden on users. In this paper, we first propose a continuous random walk model with explicit coherence regularization (CRWCR) for the extracted ROI, which helps to reduce the seeds sensitivity, so as to reduce the user interactions. Then, a very efficient algorithm to solve the CRWCR model will be developed, which helps to remove the difficulty of solving huge linear systems. Our algorithm consists of two stages: initialization by performing one-dimensional random walk sweeping based on user-provided seeds, followed by the alternating direction scheme, i.e., Peaceman&#x2013;Rachford scheme for further correction. The first stage aims to provide a good initial guess for the ROI, and it is very fast since we just solve a limited number of one-dimensional random walk problems. Then, this initial guess is evolved to the ideal solution by applying the second stage, which should also be very efficient since it fits well for GPU computing, and 10 iterations are usually sufficient for convergence. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the proposed model as well as the efficiency of the two-stage algorithm.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Online social networks (OSNs) are providing a variety of applications for human users to interact with families, friends, and even strangers. One such application, the friend search engine, allows the general public to query individual users' friend lists and has been gaining popularity recently. However, without proper design, this application may mistakenly disclose users' private relationship information. Our previous work has proposed a privacy preservation solution that can effectively boost OSNs' sociability while protecting users' friendship privacy against attacks launched by individual malicious requestors. In this paper, we propose an advanced collusion attack, where a victim user's friendship privacy can be compromised through a series of carefully designed queries coordinately launched by multiple malicious requestors. The effect of the proposed collusion attack is validated through synthetic and real-world social network data sets. The in-depth research on the advanced collusion attacks will help us design a more robust and secure friend search engine on OSNs in the near future.

<p>Garbled circuits are general tools that allow two parties to compute any function without disclosing their respective inputs. Applications of this technique vary from distributed privacy-preserving machine learning tasks to secure outsourced authentication. Unfortunately, the energy cost of garbled circuit evaluation protocols is substantial. This limits the applicability of garbled circuits in scenarios that involve battery-operated devices, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and smartphones. In this paper, we propose MEG, a Memory- and Energy-efficient Garbled circuit evaluation mechanism. MEG utilizes batch data transmission and multi-threading to reduce memory and energy consumption. We implement MEG on an Android smartphone and compare its performance and energy consumption with state-of-the-art techniques using two garbled circuits of widely different sizes (AES-128 and 256-bit edit distance). Our results show that, compared with &#x201c;plain&#x201d; garbled circuit evaluation, MEG decreases memory consumption by more than 90%. When compared with current pipelined garbled circuit evaluation techniques, MEG's energy usage was 42% lower for AES-128 and 23% lower for EDT-256. Furthermore, our multi-thread implementation of MEG decreased circuit evaluation time by up to 56.7% for AES-128, and by up to 13.5% for EDT-256, compared with state-of-the-art pipelining techniques.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper introduces a new similarity measure, the covering similarity, which we formally define for evaluating the similarity between a symbolic sequence and a set of symbolic sequences. A pairwise similarity can also be directly derived from the covering similarity to compare two symbolic sequences. An efficient implementation to compute the covering similarity is proposed which uses a suffix-tree data structure, but other implementations, based on suffix array for instance, are possible and are possibly necessary for handling very large-scale problems. We have used this similarity to isolate attack sequences from normal sequences in the scope of host-based intrusion detection. We have assessed the covering similarity on two well-known benchmarks in the field. In view of the results reported on these two datasets for the state-of-the-art methods, according to the comparative study, we have carried out based on three challenging similarity measures commonly used for string processing, or in bioinformatics, we show that the covering similarity is particularly relevant to address the detection of anomalies in sequences of system calls.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to its cost efficiency, the controller area network (CAN) is still the most wide-spread in-vehicle bus, and the numerous reported attacks demonstrate the urgency in designing new security solutions for CAN. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection mechanism that takes advantage of Bloom filtering to test frame periodicity based on message identifiers and parts of the data-field which facilitates detection of potential replay or modification attacks. This proves to be an effective approach since most of the traffic from in-vehicle buses is cyclic in nature and the format of the data-field is fixed due to rigid signal allocation. Bloom filters provide an efficient time-memory tradeoff which is beneficial for the constrained resources of automotive grade controllers. We test the correctness of our approach and obtain good results on an industry-standard CANoe-based simulation for a J1939 commercial-vehicle bus and also on CAN with flexible data-rate traces obtained from a real-world high-end vehicle. The proposed filtering mechanism is straightforward to adapt for any other time-triggered in-vehicle bus, e.g., FlexRay, since it is built on time-driven characteristics.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we consider user scheduling and power allocation techniques for downlinks where transmitted message must be kept confidential from all other unintended users and the number of users is larger than that of access point (AP) antennas. In order to maximize network secrecy rate with a limited number of antennas, the AP schedules a user who can achieve the largest secrecy rate and exploits multiple antennas for transmitting artificial noise to the unintended users. We derive the closed-form expressions of the optimal power allocation for the artificial noise and the average network secrecy rate through asymptotic analysis. The analysis results provide the insightful information on the behaviors of the user scheduling and the effect of system parameters on the network secrecy rate performance. It is shown that opportunistic scheduling with artificial noise transmission technique is more effective than the conventional precoding techniques for multiple confidential message transmissions in terms of network secrecy rate. Furthermore, we have also discussed a transmission strategy for the worst case scenarios where all unintended users are treated as colluding eavesdroppers. The simulations confirm the validity of the analysis results and provide additional information on the network performance in general cases.
