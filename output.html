<p>In the modern Web, service providers often rely heavily on third parties to
run their services. For example, they make use of ad networks to finance their
services, externally hosted libraries to develop features quickly, and
analytics providers to gain insights into visitor behavior.
</p>
<p>For security and privacy, website owners need to be aware of the content they
provide their users. However, in reality, they often do not know which third
parties are embedded, for example, when these third parties request additional
content as it is common in real-time ad auctions.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we present a large-scale measurement study to analyze the
magnitude of these new challenges. To better reflect the connectedness of third
parties, we measured their relations in a model we call third party trees,
which reflects an approximation of the loading dependencies of all third
parties embedded into a given website. Using this concept, we show that
including a single third party can lead to subsequent requests from up to eight
additional services. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the third parties
embedded on a page load are not always deterministic, as 50% of the branches in
the third party trees change between repeated visits. In addition, we found
that 93% of the analyzed websites embedded third parties that are located in
regions that might not be in line with the current legal framework. Our study
also replicates previous work that mostly focused on landing pages of websites.
We show that this method is only able to measure a lower bound as subsites show
a significant increase of privacy-invasive techniques. For example, our results
show an increase of used cookies by about 36% when crawling websites more
deeply.

<p>Session management is a fundamental component of web applications: despite
the apparent simplicity, correctly implementing web sessions is extremely
tricky, as witnessed by the large number of existing attacks. This motivated
the design of formal methods to rigorously reason about web session security

techniques. In this paper we introduce the first security type system that
enforces session security on a core model of web applications, focusing in
particular on server-side code. We showcase the expressiveness of our type

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A new cybersecurity attack,where an adversary illicitly runs crypto-mining
software over the devices of unaware users, is emerging in both the literature
and in the wild . This attack, known as cryptojacking, has proved to be very
effective given the simplicity of running a crypto-client into a target device.
Several countermeasures have recently been proposed, with different features
and performance, but all characterized by a host-based architecture. This kind
of solutions, designed to protect the individual user, are not suitable for
efficiently protecting a corporate network, especially against insiders. In
this paper, we propose a network-based approach to detect and identify
crypto-clients activities by solely relying on the network traffic, even when
encrypted. First, we provide a detailed analysis of the real network traces
generated by three major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Monero, and Bytecoin,
considering both the normal traffic and the one shaped by a VPN. Then, we
propose Crypto-Aegis, a Machine Learning (ML) based framework built over the
results of our investigation, aimed at detecting cryptocurrencies related
activities, e.g., pool mining, solo mining, and active full nodes. Our solution
achieves a striking 0.96 of F1-score and 0.99 of AUC for the ROC, while
enjoying a few other properties, such as device and infrastructure
independence. Given the extent and novelty of the addressed threat we believe
that our approach, supported by its excellent results, pave the way for further
research in this area.

<p>Short-range audio channels have a few distinguishing characteristics: ease of
use, low deployment costs, and easy to tune frequencies, to cite a few.
Moreover, thanks to their seamless adaptability to the security context, many
techniques and tools based on audio signals have been recently proposed.
However, while the most promising solutions are turning into valuable
commercial products, acoustic channels are increasingly used also to launch
attacks against systems and devices, leading to security concerns that could
thwart their adoption. To provide a rigorous, scientific, security-oriented
review of the field, in this paper we survey and classify methods,
applications, and use-cases rooted on short-range audio channels for the
provisioning of security services---including Two-Factor Authentication
techniques, pairing solutions, device authorization strategies, defense
methodologies, and attack schemes. Moreover, we also point out the strengths
and weaknesses deriving from the use of short-range audio channels. Finally, we
provide open research issues in the context of short-range audio channels

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Attacks based on power analysis have been long existing and studied, with
some recent works focused on data exfiltration from victim systems without
using conventional communications (e.g., WiFi). Nonetheless, prior works
typically rely on intrusive direct power measurement, either by implanting
meters in the power outlet or tapping into the power cable, thus jeopardizing
the stealthiness of attacks. In this paper, we propose NoDE (Noise for Data
Exfiltration), a new system for stealthy data exfiltration from enterprise
desktop computers. Specifically, NoDE achieves data exfiltration over a
building's power network by exploiting high-frequency voltage ripples (i.e.,
switching noises) generated by power factor correction circuits built into
today's computers. Located at a distance and even from a different room, the
receiver can non-intrusively measure the voltage of a power outlet to capture
the high-frequency switching noises for online information decoding without
supervised training/learning. To evaluate NoDE, we run experiments on seven
different computers from top-vendors and using top brand power supply units.
Our results show that for a single transmitter, NoDE achieves a rate of up to
28.48 bits/second with a distance of 90 feet (27.4 meters) without the line of
sight, demonstrating a practically stealthy threat. Based on the orthogonality
of switching noise frequencies of different computers, we also demonstrate
simultaneous data exfiltration from four computers using only one receiver.
Finally, we present a few possible defenses, such as installing noise filters,
and discuss their limitations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recently, food recognition has received more and more attention in image processing and computer vision for its great potential applications in human health. Most of the existing methods directly extracted deep visual features via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for food recognition. Such methods ignore the characteristics of food images and are, thus, hard to achieve optimal recognition performance. In contrast to general object recognition, food images typically do not exhibit distinctive spatial arrangement and common semantic patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale multi-view feature aggregation (MSMVFA) scheme for food recognition. MSMVFA can aggregate high-level semantic features, mid-level attribute features, and deep visual features into a unified representation. These three types of features describe the food image from different granularity. Therefore, the aggregated features can capture the semantics of food images with the greatest probability. For that solution, we utilize additional ingredient knowledge to obtain mid-level attribute representation via ingredient-supervised CNNs. High-level semantic features and deep visual features are extracted from class-supervised CNNs. Considering food images do not exhibit distinctive spatial layout in many cases, MSMVFA fuses multi-scale CNN activations for each type of features to make aggregated features more discriminative and invariable to geometrical deformation. Finally, the aggregated features are more robust, comprehensive, and discriminative via two-level fusion, namely multi-scale fusion for each type of features and multi-view aggregation for different types of features. In addition, MSMVFA is general and different deep networks can be easily applied into this scheme. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition performance on three popular large-scale food benchmark datasets in Top-1 recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we expect-
this paper will further the agenda of food recognition in the community of image processing and computer vision.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent development of object detection mainly depends on deep learning with large-scale benchmarks. However, collecting such fully-annotated data is often difficult or expensive for real-world applications, which restricts the power of deep neural networks in practice. Alternatively, humans can detect new objects with little annotation burden, since humans often use the prior knowledge to identify new objects with few elaborately-annotated examples, and subsequently generalize this capacity by exploiting objects from wild images. Inspired by this procedure of learning to detect, we propose a novel Progressive Object Transfer Detection (POTD) framework. Specifically, we make three main contributions in this paper. First, POTD can leverage various object supervision of different domains effectively into a progressive detection procedure. Via such human-like learning, one can boost a target detection task with few annotations. Second, POTD consists of two delicate transfer stages, i.e., Low-Shot Transfer Detection (LSTD), and Weakly-Supervised Transfer Detection (WSTD). In LSTD, we distill the implicit object knowledge of source detector to enhance target detector with few annotations. It can effectively warm up WSTD later on. In WSTD, we design a recurrent object labelling mechanism for learning to annotate weakly-labeled images. More importantly, we exploit the reliable object supervision from LSTD, which can further enhance the robustness of target detector in the WSTD stage. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on a number of challenging detection benchmarks with different settings. The results demonstrate that, our POTD outperforms the recent state-of-the-art approaches. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/Cassie94/LSTD/tree/lstd.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Multi-task deep learning methods learn multiple tasks simultaneously and share representations amongst them, so information from related tasks improves learning within one task. The generalization capabilities of the produced models are substantially enhanced. Typical multi-task deep learning models usually share representations of different tasks in lower layers of the network, and separate representations of different tasks in higher layers. However, different groups of tasks always have different requirements for sharing representations, so the required design criterion does not necessarily guarantee that the obtained network architecture is optimal. In addition, most existing methods ignore the redundancy problem and lack the pre-screening process for representations before they are shared. Here, we propose a model called Attention-aware Multi-task Convolutional Neural Network, which automatically learns appropriate sharing through end-to-end training. The attention mechanism is introduced into our architecture to suppress redundant contents contained in the representations. The shortcut connection is adopted to preserve useful information. We evaluate our model by carrying out experiments on different task groups and different datasets. Our model demonstrates an improvement over existing techniques in many experiments, indicating the effectiveness and the robustness of the model. We also demonstrate the importance of attention mechanism and shortcut connection in our model.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Light field (LF) stitching is a potential solution to improve the field of view (FOV) for hand-held plenoptic cameras. Existing LF stitching methods cannot provide accurate registration for scenes with large depth variation. In this paper, a novel LF stitching method is proposed to handle parallax in the LFs more flexibly and accurately. First, a depth layer map (DLM) is proposed to guarantee adequate feature points on each depth layer. For the regions of nondeterministic depth, superpixel layer map (SLM) is proposed based on LF spatial correlation analysis to refine the depth layer assignments. Then, DLM-SLM-based LF registration is proposed to derive the location dependent homography transforms accurately and to warp LFs to its corresponding position without parallax interference. 4D graph-cut is further applied to fuse the registration results for higher LF spatial continuity and angular continuity. Horizontal, vertical and multi-LF stitching are tested for different scenes, which demonstrates the superior performance provided by the proposed method in terms of subjective quality of the stitched LFs, epipolar plane image consistency in the stitched LF, and perspective-averaged correlation between the stitched LF and the input LFs.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>An effort-based reward approach is proposed in this article for the allocation of load shedding amount in interconnected microgrids. In this article, effort is defined as the relative contribution of a microgrid to the network with respect to its capacity. In contrast to the absolute contribution-based reward methods, where smaller microgrids are discriminated, the proposed effort-based reward method provides a fair chance for microgrids of all sizes. Historic data of efforts of each microgrid are recorded and an index (effort index) is formulated. The effort index is used as a measure to allocate load shedding to microgrids during emergencies, where microgrids with higher effort indices receive lesser load shedding and vice versa. Different weights are defined for efforts of microgrids depending on the operation mode of the network due to the difference in the importance of power sharing in each mode. In addition, a reward compensation algorithm is devised to mitigate gaining of benefits for longer times while making lesser contributions. The proposed method is realized by using a multiagent system in java agent development framework (JADE) via agent communication language messages. The performance of the proposed method is compared with existing load shedding allocation algorithms, i.e., proportional method, bankruptcy Talmud rule, and absolute contribution-based reward methods.

<p>This article concerns a novel auxiliary-model-based expectation maximization (EM) estimation method for Hammerstein systems with data loss by extending the EM method to estimate models with multiple parameter vectors. The novel EM method relaxes the requirements on an autoregression model with one parameter vector, interactively maximizes the expectation over multiple parameter vectors in a more general model, and uses the output of an auxiliary model to substitute the missing outputs in the information vector in iteration processes. A numerical simulation is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed novel EM method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In modern Internet of Things (IoT), visual analysis and predictions are often performed by deep learning models. Salient object detection (SOD) is a fundamental preprocessing for these applications. Executing SOD on the fog devices is a challenging task due to the diversity of data and fog devices. To adopt convolutional neural networks (CNN) on fog&#x2013;cloud infrastructures for SOD-based applications, we introduce a semisupervised adversarial learning method in this article. The proposed model, named as SaliencyGAN, is empowered by a novel concatenated generative adversarial network (GAN) framework with partially shared parameters. The backbone CNN can be chosen flexibly based on the specific devices and applications. In the meanwhile, our method uses both the labeled and unlabeled data from different problem domains for training. Using multiple popular benchmark datasets, we compared state-of-the-art baseline methods to our SaliencyGAN obtained with 10&#x2013;100&#x0025; labeled training data. SaliencyGAN gained performance comparable to the supervised baselines when the percentage of labeled data reached 30&#x0025;, and outperformed the weakly supervised and unsupervised baselines. Furthermore, our ablation study shows that SaliencyGAN were more robust to the common &#x201c;mode missing&#x201d; (or &#x201c;mode collapse&#x201d;) issue compared to the selected popular GAN models. The visualized ablation results have proved that SaliencyGAN learned a better estimation of data distributions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first IoT-oriented semisupervised SOD method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The advances of artificial intelligence (AI) propels big data processing and transmission for Internet of Things (IoT), by capturing and structuring big data produced by heterogeneous devices. While applying blockchain to manage IoT devices and associated big data, the blockchain itself suffers from abuse of decentralization from anonymous users. Specifically, it has been utilized to facilitate black market trades and illegal activities. Ateniese et&#x00a0;al. proposed using the chameleon hash (CH) to derive redactable blockchain (EuroS&amp;P), which works by embedding a trapdoor in the basic hash function so that block content can be rewritten without causing major hard forks. In short, the redacted block hash remains unchanged. However, there is lacking intelligent design where any mistakes observed in the chain can be corrected universally and automatically. This creates disincentives to use redactable blockchain (RB) for managing big data or any data-driven business mainly due to ineffective chain redaction. To solve this problem, in this article, we propose the notion of the self-redactable blockchain (SRB) to support intelligent execution of chain redaction. Specifically, we propose the first revocable chameleon hash (RCH) to power RB. It enables an ephemeral trapdoor for finding collision without any co-operation. Periodical expiration is applied to committed hash and an ephemeral trapdoor to prevent any abuses of redaction power. We instantiate how to use our RCH to build SRB as an intelligent trust-layer for IoT. We also give a rigorous analysis as well as comprehensive experiments to validate our proposals. The evidence showed that our proposal is secure and acceptably efficient for IoT devices.

<p>Researchers have developed a novel set of equations for heat propagation that explain why and how heat propagation can become fluid-like, rather than diffusive. These 'viscous heat equations' show how heat conduction is not only governed by thermal conductivity, but also by thermal viscosity. The theory is in striking agreement with pioneering experimental results in graphite published last year and may pave the way for the design of more efficient electronic devices.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We study the trade-off between secret message (SM) and secret key (SK) rates, simultaneously achievable over a state-dependent (SD) wiretap channel (WTC) with non-causal channel state information (CSI) at the encoder. This model subsumes other instances of CSI availability as special cases, and calls for efficient utilization of the state sequence for both reliability and security purposes. An inner bound on the semantic-security (SS) SM-SK capacity region is derived based on a superposition coding scheme inspired by a past work of the authors. The region is shown to attain capacity for a certain class of SD-WTCs. SS is established by virtue of two versions of the strong soft-covering lemma. The derived region yields an improvement upon the previously best known SM-SK trade-off result reported by Prabhakaran et al., and, to the best of our knowledge, upon all other existing lower bounds for either SM or SK for this setup, even if the semantic security requirement is relaxed to weak secrecy. It is demonstrated that our region can be strictly larger than those reported in the preceding works.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Most whole-slide histological images are stained with two or more chemical dyes. Slide stain separation or color deconvolution is a crucial step within the digital pathology workflow. In this paper, the blind color deconvolution problem is formulated within the Bayesian framework. Starting from a multi-stained histological image, our model takes into account both spatial relations among the concentration image pixels and similarity between a given reference color-vector matrix and the estimated one. Using Variational Bayes inference, three efficient new blind color deconvolution methods are proposed which provide automated procedures to estimate all the model parameters in the problem. A comparison with classical and current state-of-the-art color deconvolution algorithms using real images has been carried out demonstrating the superiority of the proposed approach.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Finite set model predictive torque control (FCSMPTC) of induction machines has received widespread attention in recent years due to its fast dynamic response, intuitive concept, and ability to handle nonlinear constraints. However, FCSMPTC essentially belongs to the open-loop control paradigm, and unmatched parameters inevitably cause electromagnetic torque tracking error. In addition, the outer loop (i.e., the speed loop) based on a proportional-integral (PI) regulator cannot achieve optimal control between speed dynamic response and torque tracking error compensation. The traditional control paradigm is abbreviated as PI-MPTC. In order to solve the aforementioned problem, this paper proposes active disturbance-rejection-based model predictive torque control (ADR-MPTC). First, the influence mechanism of mismatched parameters on torque prediction error in PI-MPTC is studied, and then the performance of a traditional PI regulator used to compensate for torque prediction error is analyzed. Second, this paper introduces several parts of the proposed ADR-MPTC, including the design of the torque prediction error observer, nonlinear prediction error compensation strategies, an enhanced predictive torque control, and a simplified full-order flux observer. Finally, PI-MPTC and ADR-MPTC are studied experimentally. The experimental results show that compared with PI-MPTC, ADR-MPTC performs better in dynamic and steady states, and has stronger robustness.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>For high-speed permanent magnet machines (HSPMMs), the permanent magnet (PM) is more likely to suffer irreversible demagnetization because the heat dissipation is serious in the HSPMMs, especially for the high-power machines. This paper focuses on the comprehensive research results on the power loss and thermal characteristic for a high-power HSPMM. First, the power loss at the rated load is investigated by finite-element analysis. Then, the temperature distribution of four cooling schemes is compared by the electromagnetic-thermal iteration calculation. The effect of different parameters on thermal behavior is obtained to reduce rotor temperature, which includes an examination of the axial flow duct, cooling medium, sleeve thickness, and sleeve thermal conductivity. Finally, an improved loss separation method is employed to obtain the loss distribution from the measured total loss, and the comprehensive experiments are implemented based on one HSPMM prototype (800 kW, 15 000 rpm) to verify the related theoretical analysis.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Differential power processing (DPP) is a promising architecture to solve the issue caused by mismatches among photovoltaic (PV) submodules. To eliminate the mismatch power losses, this paper presents an optimized PV-to-bus DPP system with submodule-level individual maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and module-level minimum-power tracking (MPT) simultaneous implementation according to the built mathematical model of the power processed by DPP converters with respect to the string current. Furthermore, a flexible time-sharing algorithm is adopted to reduce the number of MPPT units. Compared with other solutions, such as PV optimizer, the proposed scheme can reduce the effects of mismatches to the minimum regardless of mismatch conditions. The system cost is reduced since only one adaptive MPPT controller is required. Besides, the system efficiency is improved due to the true MPPT implementation and MPT control. Both simulation and experimental tests are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Time delay control (TDC) is a promising technique for robot manipulators because it is model-free, efficient, and yet, robust. Nevertheless, when a robot operates under significant payload changes, it is difficult to achieve satisfactory performance with a constant gain. To cope with this problem, several adaptive rules have already been proposed thus far, but they are less effective to significant payload changes, and parameter tuning procedures are too complicated. In this paper, we propose an adaptive gain dynamics that is more effective in payload changes and yet simpler to implement. Through simulations using a one-link arm and experiments using a whole arm manipulator with payload changes, the proposed dynamics was compared with the conventional TDC and two other existing methods. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can adapt to significant payload changes, achieving better accuracy than the conventional TDC. Experimental results show that the proposed method has consistently better adaptation capability than other methods, achieving significantly better accuracy. In addition, the proposed method is simpler to implement, having only one tuning parameter, whereas the existing methods require four or five such tuning parameters.
