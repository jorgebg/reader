<p>Hyperacusis involves a reduced tolerance or increased sensitivity to everyday sounds, whereby they become intense and overwhelming. This condition is experienced by 3&#183;7% of children and up to 9&#183;2% of adults in the world, with a higher prevalence in certain populations, such as people who have Williams' syndrome or autism spectrum disorders.1 Hyperacusis-associated problems are many, including fear, pain, avoidance behaviours, and impairments to quality of life, such as reduced ability to work.2 For children with hyperacusis, the classroom can be particularly challenging, and strategies are needed to ensure their wellbeing and educational needs are met.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Thanks to Mr. James Bond, we are aware that diamonds are forever but, are fingerprints? It is well known that biometrics brings to the security field a new paradigm; unlike traditional systems, individuals are not identified by something that they have or they know, but by what they are. While such an approach entails some clear advantages, an important question remains: is what we are today the same as what we will be tomorrow? This paper addresses such a key problem in the fingerprint modality based on a database of over 400K impressions coming from more than 250K different fingers. The database was acquired under real operational conditions and contains fingerprints from subjects aged 0&#x2013;25 and 65&#x2013;98 years. Fingerprint pairs were collected with a time difference that ranges between 0 and 7 years. Such a unique set of data has allowed us to analyze both the age and ageing effects, shedding some new light into issues, such as fingerprint permanence and fingerprint quality.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Video stabilization techniques are essential for most hand-held captured videos due to high-frequency shakes. Several 2D-, 2.5D-, and 3D-based stabilization techniques have been presented previously, but to the best of our knowledge, no solutions based on deep neural networks had been proposed to date. The main reason for this omission is shortage in training data as well as the challenge of modeling the problem using neural networks. In this paper, we present a video stabilization technique using a convolutional neural network. Previous works usually propose an off-line algorithm that smoothes a holistic camera path based on feature matching. Instead, we focus on low-latency, real-time camera path smoothing that does not explicitly represent the camera path and does not use future frames. Our neural network model, called StabNet, learns a set of mesh-grid transformations progressively for each input frame from the previous set of stabilized camera frames and creates stable corresponding latent camera paths implicitly. To train the network, we collect a dataset of synchronized steady and unsteady video pairs via a specially designed hand-held hardware. Experimental results show that our proposed online method performs comparatively to the traditional off-line video stabilization methods without using future frames while running about 10 times faster. More importantly, our proposed StabNet is able to handle low-quality videos, such as night-scene videos, watermarked videos, blurry videos, and noisy videos, where the existing methods fail in feature extraction or matching.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Using multi-atlas registration (MAR), information carried by atlases can be transferred onto a new input image for the tasks of region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation, anatomical landmark detection, and so on. Conventional atlases used in MAR methods are monomodal and contain only normal anatomical structures. Therefore, the majority of MAR methods cannot handle input multimodal pathological images, which are often collected in routine image-based diagnosis. This is because registering monomodal atlases with normal appearances to multimodal pathological images involves two major problems: 1) missing imaging modalities in the monomodal atlases and 2) influence from pathological regions. In this paper, we propose a new MAR framework to tackle these problems. In this framework, deep learning-based image synthesizers are applied for synthesizing multimodal normal atlases from conventional monomodal normal atlases. To reduce the influence from pathological regions, we further propose a multimodal low-rank approach to recover multimodal normal-looking images from multimodal pathological images. Finally, the multimodal normal atlases can be registered to the recovered multimodal images in a multi-channel way. We evaluate our MAR framework via brain ROI segmentation of multimodal tumor brain images. Due to the utilization of multimodal information and the reduced influence from pathological regions, experimental results show that registration based on our method is more accurate and robust, leading to significantly improved brain ROI segmentation compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Stereoscopic saliency detection plays an important role in various stereoscopic video processing applications. However, conventional stereoscopic video saliency detection methods mainly use independent low-level features instead of extracting them automatically, and thus, they ignore the intrinsic relationship between the spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel stereoscopic video saliency detection method based on 3D convolutional neural networks, namely, deep 3D video saliency (Deep3DSaliency). The proposed network consists of two sub-models: spatiotemporal saliency model (STSM) and stereoscopic saliency aware model (SSAM). STSM directly takes three consecutive video frames as the input to extract visual spatiotemporal features, while SSAM attempts to further infer the depth and semantic features from the left and right video frames by shared parameters from STSM. The visual spatiotemporal features from STSM and the depth and semantic features from SSAM are learned by an alternating optimization scheme. Finally, all these saliency-related features are combined together for the final stereoscopic saliency detection via 3D deconvolution. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed model over other existing ones in saliency estimation for 3D video sequences.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A class-agnostic tracker typically consists of three key components, i.e., its motion model, its target appearance model, and its updating strategy. However, most recent top-performing trackers mainly focus on constructing complicated appearance models and updating strategies, while using comparatively simple and heuristic motion models that may result in an inefficient search and degrade the tracking performance. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical tracker that learns to move and track based on the combination of data-driven search at the coarse level and coarse-to-fine verification at the fine level. At the coarse level, a data-driven motion model learned from deep recurrent reinforcement learning provides our tracker with coarse localization of an object. By formulating motion search as an action-decision problem in reinforcement learning, our tracker utilizes a recurrent convolutional neural network-based deep Q-network to effectively learn data-driven searching policies. The learned motion model can not only significantly reduce the search space but also provide more reliable interested regions for further verifying. At the fine level, a kernelized correlation filter (KCF)-based appearance model is adopted to densely yet efficiently verify a local region centered on the predicted location from the motion model. Through use of circulant matrices and fast Fourier transformation, a large number of candidate samples in the local region can be efficiently and effectively evaluated by the KCF-based appearance model. Finally, a simple yet robust estimator is designed to analyze possible tracking failure. The experiments on OTB50 and OTB100 illustrate that our tracker achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art trackers.

<p><span class="paragraphSection"><strong>To the Editor</strong> Dr Psaty and colleagues compared precision medicine and preventive medicine as 2 distinct models in medicine. They posited that precision medicine is deterministic, often with a gene-centric approach, while preventive medicine is probabilistic and applies to common conditions such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The 2 models are complementary and not competitive. Emerging scientific evidence will guide physicians toward preventive and curative interventions that can work best at the population or individual levels. As envisioned by the All of Us research program, precision medicine encompasses both treatment and prevention and is more than genetics: &#8220;Precision medicine takes into account individual differences in lifestyle, environment, and biology.&#8221; Furthermore, precision does not necessarily imply biologic determinism. Most human diseases are due to complex gene-environment interactions that can lead only to probabilistic approaches to prevention.</span>

We fully recognize that we are in the presence of a great social upheaval whose effect throughout the world will probably surpass even that momentous event known as the French Revolution. We can see only dimly whither we are tending, but it is at least evident that civilization is moving rapidly, whether down a steep place into the sea or, as some believe, up into the heights of the Promised Land. In this movement the medical profession is to a degree caught in the sweep of forces beyond its control, but it is also to a large extent potent and responsible for the part it shall play in the new era dawning on us. Many individual physicians have been more or less completely, if temporarily, uprooted by mobilization for war, and the whole medical profession, like many other professions, has been jostled out of its stability and routine. It is a time to many for strenuous readjustment; it is also an unequaled opportunity for surveying the future of medicine and formulating plans for a rational development. One thing is certain: that no limited considerations of self interest are going to satisfy either the bulk of medical practitioners or the public they serve. The practice of medicine will more than ever be regarded not merely as a means of earning a livelihood but as an essential service to mankind.</span>

<p><span class="paragraphSection">To fully understand the effects of the opioid epidemic on families and communities across the United States, the broader context in which drug use is occurring must be considered. In this issue of <span style="font-style: italic;">JAMA</span>, Patrick and colleagues present evidence showing the connection between community capacity and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which is one effect of the opioid epidemic. Neonatal abstinence syndrome is a condition associated with exposure to opioids in utero that results in hyperirritability at birth, feeding difficulty, respiratory problems, and sometimes the separation of mother and infant during a critical period of bonding. Neonatal abstinence syndrome is treatable, and cases left untreated may result in serious illness such as seizures and even death.</span>

<p>The thermal camera can capture keyboard surface temperature change after a human&#x2019;s touch. This phenomenon may be used to steal users&#x2019; passwords physically. In this paper, based on the study of thermal dynamics of keyboards, we design a password break system using an infrared thermal camera. First, we build a signal model to describe the dynamic process of temperature change on the keyboard using Newton&#x2019;s law of cooling. Next, we develop a maximum likelihood parameter estimation algorithm to estimate the keystroke time instants. Then, by maximizing the probability of key order arrangement, a novel password breaking algorithm is developed. Our algorithm is tested using simulated data as well as real-world data. Experiment results show that our algorithm is effective for physical password breaking using thermal characteristics. Based on our results, we discuss strategies for password protection at the end.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The forensic investigation of JPEG compression generally relies on the analysis of first-order statistics based on image histogram. The JPEG compression detection methods based on such methodology can be effortlessly circumvented by adopting some anti-forensic attacks. This paper presents a counter JPEG anti-forensic method by considering the second-order statistical analysis based on the co-occurrence matrices (CMs). The proposed framework comprises three stages: selection of the target difference image, evaluation of CMs, and generation of second-order statistical feature based on CMs. In the first stage, we explore the effects of dithering operation of JPEG anti-forensics by analyzing the variance inconsistencies along the diagonals. Afterward, CMs are evaluated in the second stage to highlight the effects of grainy noise introduced during the dithering operation. The third stage is devoted to generate an optimal second-order statistical feature which is fed to the SVM classifier. The experimental results based on the uncompressed color image database and BOSSBase dataset images demonstrated that the proposed forensic detector based on CM is very efficient even in the presence of anti-forensic attacks. Moreover, the experimental results also confirm the competency of the proposed method in counter median filtering and contrast enhancement anti-forensics. The proposed scheme also provides satisfactory results in detecting other image processing operations such as mean filtering, Gaussian filtering, Weiner filtering, scaling, and rotation, thereby revealing its multi-purpose nature.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We study deterministic approximations of the Gaussian two-user multiple access wiretap channel (G-MAC-WT) and the Gaussian wiretap channel with a helper (G-WT-H). These approximations enable results beyond the recently shown 2/3 and 1/2 secure degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) for the G-MAC-WT and the G-WT-H, respectively. While the s.d.o.f. were obtained by real interference alignment, our approach uses signal-scale alignment. We show achievable schemes which are independent of the rationality of the channel gains. Moreover, our results can differentiate between channel strengths, in particular, between both users, and will establish secrecy rates dependent on this difference. We can show that the resulting achievable secrecy rates tend to the s.d.o.f. for vanishing channel gain differences. Moreover, we extend previous and develop new techniques to prove generalized s.d.o.f. bounds for varying channel strengths and show that our achievable schemes reach the bounds for certain channel gain parameters. We believe that our analysis is the next step toward a constant-gap analysis of the G-MAC-WT and the G-WT-H.

<p>Multiple user active authentications, in contrast with the single user active authentication, require the verification of identity of multiple subjects. Both traditional verification and identification-based solutions fail to address the specific challenges presented in this problem. We introduce Extremal Openset Rejection, a two-fold mechanism with a sparse representation-based identification step and a verification step for this purpose. In the verification step, concentration of the sparsity vector and the overlap between matched and non-matched distributions are considered for decision making. We introduce a semi-parametric model based on Extreme Value Theory for modeling the distributions, and an algorithm to estimate the parameters of extreme value distributions. Effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using three publicly available face-based mobile active authentication data sets.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>As one of the most widely used clustering techniques, the fuzzy  $k$ -means (FKM) assigns every data point to each cluster with a certain degree of membership. However, conventional FKM approach relies on the square data fitting term, which is sensitive to the outliers with ignoring the prior information. In this paper, we develop a novel and robust fuzzy  $k$ -means clustering algorithm, namely, joint learning of fuzzy  $k$ -means and nonnegative spectral clustering with side information. The proposed method combines fuzzy  $k$ -means and nonnegative spectral clustering into a unified model, which can further exploit the prior knowledge of data pairs such that both the quality of affinity graph and the clustering performance can be improved. In addition, for the purpose of enhancing the robustness, the adaptive loss function is adopted in the objective function, since it smoothly interpolates between  $ell _{1}$ -norm and  $ell _{2}$ -norm. Finally, experimental results on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness and the superiority of our clustering method.

<p>Common fall occurrences in the elderly population pose dramatic challenges in public healthcare domain. Adoption of an efficient and yet highly reliable automatic fall detection system may not only mitigate the adverse effects of falls through immediate medical assistance, but also profoundly improve the functional ability and confidence level of elder people. This paper presents a pervasive fall detection system developed on smart phones, namely, FallDroid that exploits a two-step algorithm proposed to monitor and detect fall events using the embedded accelerometer signals. Comprising of the threshold-based method and multiple kernel learning support vector machine, the proposed algorithm uses novel techniques to effectively identify fall-like events (such as lying on a bed or sudden stop after running) and reduce false alarms. In addition to user convenience and low power consumption, experimental results reveal that the system detects falls with high accuracy ($97.8%$ and $91.7%$), sensitivity ($99.5%$ and $95.8%$), and specificity ($95.2%$ and $88.0%$) when placed around the waist and thigh, respectively. The system also achieves the lowest false alarm rate of 1 alarm per 59 h of usage, which is best till date.

Furthermore, the reachability of sliding motion is proved. Then, the networked predictive control method is employed to compensate the communication constraints.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Extracting electric vehicle (EV) charging loads is an important aspect that enables smart grid operators to make informed and intelligent decisions about conserving power and promoting the reliability of the electrical grid. This paper presents an unsupervised algorithm to extract the EV charging loads (EVCLs) nonintrusively from the smart meter data. The proposed algorithm can run on low-frequency smart meter sampling data and only requires the real power measurement, which is the type of data communicated and recorded by most smart meters. Validation results on real aggregated household loads have shown that the proposed approach is a promising solution to extract EVCLs and that the approach can effectively mitigate the interference of other appliances that have similar load behaviors as EVs. Furthermore, the extraction of such load behaviors can be aggregated and open further smart grid analyses and studies.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>One of the major obstacles facing the large-scale integration of renewable energy sources to existing power networks is the large magnitude of fluctuations and uncertainties introduced to aggregated demand profiles. Such variations make the supply&#x2013;demand matching a more challenging task, and increase the operational cost of the power system. In this paper, we provide an effective, yet simple, methodology for smoothing power variations using the demand response of a large number of residential appliances. We first present a demand aggregation model based on queueing theory that can accommodate both deferrable and thermostatically controlled loads. Second, controllable demands are scheduled using an online algorithm to smooth the net noncontrollable demand profile. The performance of our methodology is evaluated using realistic data.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the diagnosis and compensation for sensor and actuator faults in a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle. Without adding sensors or actuators for increased hardware redundancy, an observer-based adaptive controller is proposed to estimate and compensate for the faults. First, using a feedback linearization technique, an inner controller is designed to transform the form of the considered quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle with faults into a nonlinear system with Lipschitz-like nonlinearities and parametric faulty models. Second, the estimations for unmeasurable state and actuator faults are performed in an output-feedback outer controller to compensate for the actuator faults. Third, a nonlinear high-gain observer is designed to provide the information of the state and faults to the outer controller, with the compensations for sensor faults. A Lyapunov-based analysis shows that appropriate choices of the controller parameters can guarantee the exponential convergence of errors in estimation and trajectory tracking under uncertainties and faults. The robustness to the external disturbances is also discussed. Simulations are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The proposed approach is also implemented on a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle to show its feasibility in real-time applications.

<p>The inherent second-harmonic ripple power in a cascaded H-bridge (CHB)-based motor drive system poses the demand of large capacitors in the dc link of each cell. In this paper, an active power decoupling method based on negative sequence current injection and its corresponding dual voltage closed-loop control are proposed to solve this problem without adding any extra components. The proposed dual voltage closed-loop control system consists of a conventional active power control loop and a frequency-adaptive ripple power control loop. The ripple power control loop aims at injecting a set of negative sequence decoupling currents into the front ends of the cells to remove the ripple powers with variable frequency. Higher steady-state accuracy and robustness are, therefore, achieved compared to the open-loop control. Moreover, to simplify the control system, the ripple power control loop can be integrated into the active power control loop without introducing a harmonic reference frame transformation. By adopting the proposed control, the dc capacitance can be reduced to less than 10&#x0025; of the conventional case. The effectiveness and practicability of this method are verified by simulation and experimental results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a novel oversampling deadbeat current control approach for permanent magnet synchronous motor drives capable of operating at a controller sampling frequency multiple of the power converter switching frequency. Model-based controllers suffer from heavy computational demand and performance degradation due to parameter uncertainties. The proposed controller concurrently with field-programmable gate array implementation permits to achieve a constant switching frequency and an optimal current ripple along with a high current-loop bandwidth and robust behavior to parameter variation. A disturbance observer has been added to the proposed controller in order to compensate for the converter voltage distortions. The proposed control strategy is tested through both simulations and experiments.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>High step-up converters are required for distributed photovoltaic generation systems, due to the low voltage of the photovoltaic source. In this paper, a new hybrid high voltage gain dc&#x2013;dc converter is created by merging the standard boost converter with a coupled inductor and different switched-capacitor techniques. With a single switch and no requirement of higher duty cycle values, the proposed converter achieves a high voltage gain and high efficiency, in addition to lowered voltage and current stresses of the components. A 200-W prototype was implemented experimentally to evaluate the converter, which reached a maximum efficiency of 97.6&#x0025;.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The employment of solar microconverter allows a more detailed monitoring of the photovoltaic (PV) output power at the single module level; thus, machine learning techniques are capable to track the peculiarities of modules in the PV plants, such as regular shadings. In this way, it is possible to compare in real time the day-ahead forecast power with the actual one in order to better evaluate faults or anomalous trends that might have occurred in the PV plant. This paper presents a method for an effective fault diagnosis; this method is based on the day-ahead forecast of the output power from an existing PV module, linked to a microconverter, and on the outcome of the neighbor PV modules. Finally, this paper also proposes the analysis of the most common error definitions with new mathematical formulations, by comparing their effectiveness and immediate comprehension, in view of increasing power forecasting accuracy and performing both real-time and offline analysis of PV modules performance and possible faults.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a new design of near-field focused metasurface for high-efficiency wireless power transfer with multifocus characteristics. A general synthesis procedure is outlined to design metasurfaces with desired multiple foci in the near-field zone. The unit cell of printed tridipole is used to realize the focused metasurface which has a large range of phase shift and is adapted to near-field focusing applications. Different feeding and focusing designs of the printed tridipole metasurfaces are proposed and analyzed. Two kinds of metasurfaces with 20&#x00d7;20 elements are designed, fabricated, and measured at 5.8&#x00a0;GHz. One is the single-feed and single-focus case, and the other is single-feed and two-focus case. Two-dimensional planar near-field scanning technique is implemented to measure the E-field focusing characteristics. Full-wave simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed focusing metasurfaces have a high wireless power transfer efficiency of 70&#x0025;. The relative bandwidth with 50&#x0025; power focusing efficiency is about 16&#x0025;. The measured results are in good agreement with the theoretical designs and simulated results, which verify the feasibility and correctness of the proposed approach in this paper.
