<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent studies have shown that adversarial examples in state-of-the-art image
classifiers trained by deep neural networks (DNN) can be easily generated when
the target model is transparent to an attacker, known as the white-box setting.
However, when attacking a deployed machine learning service, one can only
acquire the input-output correspondences of the target model; this is the
so-called black-box attack setting. The major drawback of existing black-box
attacks is the need for excessive model queries, which may give a false sense
of model robustness due to inefficient query designs. To bridge this gap, we
propose a generic framework for query-efficient black-box attacks. Our
framework, AutoZOOM, which is short for Autoencoder-based Zeroth Order
Optimization Method, has two novel building blocks towards efficient black-box
attacks: (i) an adaptive random gradient estimation strategy to balance query
counts and distortion, and (ii) an autoencoder that is either trained offline
with unlabeled data or a bilinear resizing operation for attack acceleration.
Experimental results suggest that, by applying AutoZOOM to a state-of-the-art
black-box attack (ZOO), a significant reduction in model queries can be
achieved without sacrificing the attack success rate and the visual quality of
the resulting adversarial examples. In particular, when compared to the
standard ZOO method, AutoZOOM can consistently reduce the mean query counts in
finding successful adversarial examples (or reaching the same distortion level)
by at least 93% on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, leading to novel
insights on adversarial robustness.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>As multi-agent systems proliferate and share more user data, new approaches
are needed to protect sensitive data while still enabling system operation. To
address this need, we present a private multi-agent LQ control framework. We
consider problems in which each agent has linear dynamics and the agents are
coupled by a quadratic cost. Generating optimal control values for agents is a
centralized operation, and we therefore introduce a cloud computer into the
network for this purpose. The cloud is tasked with aggregating agents' outputs,
computing control inputs, and transmitting these inputs to the agents, which
apply them in their state updates. Agents' state trajectories can be sensitive
and we therefore protect them using differential privacy. Differential privacy
is a statistical notion of privacy enforced by adding noise to sensitive data
(or functions thereof) before sharing it, and agents add noise to all data
before sending it to the cloud. The result is a private multi-agent LQG
framework in which agents' states are protected from both the cloud and other
agents. We quantify the impact of privacy along three dimensions: the amount of
information shared under privacy, the control-theoretic cost of privacy, and
the tradeoffs between privacy and performance. These analyses are done in
conventional control-theoretic terms, which we use to develop guidelines for
calibrating privacy as a function of system parameters. Numerical results are
provided to illustrate these results.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Differential privacy offers formal quantitative guarantees for algorithms
over datasets, but it assumes attackers that know and can influence all but one
record in the database. This assumption often vastly overapproximates the
attackers' actual strength, resulting in unnecessarily poor utility.
</p>
<p>Recent work has made significant steps towards privacy in the presence of
partial background knowledge, which can model a realistic attacker's
uncertainty. Prior work, however, has definitional problems for correlated data
and does not precisely characterize the underlying attacker model. We propose a
practical criterion to prevent problems due to correlations, and we show how to
characterize attackers with limited influence or only partial background
knowledge over the dataset. We use these foundations to analyze practical
scenarios: we significantly improve known results about the privacy of counting
queries under partial knowledge, and we show that thresholding can provide
formal guarantees against such weak attackers, even with little entropy in the
data. Finally, we prove composition results on differential privacy with
partial knowledge, which quantifies the privacy leakage of complex mechanisms.
</p>
<p>Together, our results provide a basis for formally quantifying the privacy of
many widely-used mechanisms, e.g. publishing the result of surveys, elections
or referendums, and releasing usage statistics of online services.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Lyra2REv2 is a hashing algorithm that consists of a chain of individual
hashing algorithms, and it is used as a proof-of-work function in several
cryptocurrencies. The most crucial and exotic hashing algorithm in the
Lyra2REv2 chain is a specific instance of the general Lyra2 algorithm. This
work presents the first hardware implementation of the specific instance of
Lyra2 that is used in Lyra2REv2. Several properties of the aforementioned
algorithm are exploited in order to optimize the design. In addition, an
FPGA-based hardware implementation of a standalone miner for Lyra2REv2 on a
Xilinx Multi-Processor System on Chip is presented. The proposed Lyra2REv2
miner is shown to be significantly more energy efficient than both a GPU and a
commercially available FPGA-based miner. Finally, we also explain how the
simplified Lyra2 and Lyra2REv2 architectures can be modified with minimal
effort to also support the recent Lyra2REv3 chained hashing algorithm.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In a Cross-Origin State Inference (COSI) attack, an attacker convinces a
victim into visiting an attack web page, which leverages the cross-origin
interaction features of the victim's web browser to infer the victim's state at
a target web site. Multiple instances of COSI attacks have been found in the
past under different names such as login detection or access detection attacks.
But, those attacks only consider two states (e.g., logged in or not) and focus
on a specific browser leak method (or XS-Leak). This work shows that mounting
more complex COSI attacks such as deanonymizing the owner of an account,
determining if the victim owns sensitive content, and determining the victim's
account type often requires considering more than two states. Furthermore,
robust attacks require supporting a variety of browsers since the victim's
browser cannot be predicted apriori. To address these issues, we present a
novel approach to identify and build complex COSI attacks that differentiate
more than two states and support multiple browsers by combining multiple attack
vectors, possibly using different XS-Leaks. To enable our approach, we
introduce the concept of a COSI attack class. We propose two novel techniques
to generalize existing COSI attack instances into COSI attack classes and to
discover new COSI attack classes. We systematically apply our techniques to
existing attacks, identifying 40 COSI attack classes. As part of this process,
we discover a novel XS-Leak based on window.postMessage. We implement our
approach into Basta-COSI, a tool to find COSI attacks in a target web site. We
apply Basta-COSI to test four stand-alone web applications and 58 popular web
sites, finding COSI attacks against each of them.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The emergence of the high-efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard enables people to enjoy high definition (HD) video content; meanwhile, HD videos, tamper detection has become a crucial issue and gradually aroused people's attention. The detection of double HEVC compressed videos with the same coding parameters is challenging since the recompression traces are inconspicuous. To deal with this issue, a novel method based on the intra prediction mode is proposed in this paper. First, the quality degradation mechanism is analyzed to facilitate the selection of classification features and the source of error in intra coding is fully considered to establish the equivalent error model. Second, the feature model of double HEVC compression detection, which is mainly based on the statistical feature of intra prediction mode, is proposed. Finally, the experiment is carried out in 720p and 1080p HEVC videos instead of low-resolution (CIF or QCIF) videos. Experimental results have demonstrated better efficiency of the proposed method in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the proposed method is more robust to various encoding configurations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used for image recognition, speech recognition, and other pattern analysis tasks. Despite the success of DNNs, these systems can be exploited by what is termed adversarial examples. An adversarial example, in which a small distortion is added to the input data, can be designed to be misclassified by the DNN while remaining undetected by humans or other systems. Such adversarial examples have been studied mainly in the image domain. Recently, however, studies on adversarial examples have been expanding into the voice domain. For example, when an adversarial example is applied to enemy wiretapping devices (victim classifiers) in a military environment, the enemy device will misinterpret the intended message. In such scenarios, it is necessary that friendly wiretapping devices (protected classifiers) should not be deceived. Therefore, the selective adversarial example concept can be useful in mixed situations, defined as situations in which there is both a classifier to be protected and a classifier to be attacked. In this paper, we propose a selective audio adversarial example with minimum distortion that will be misclassified as the target phrase by a victim classifier but correctly classified as the original phrase by a protected classifier. To generate such examples, a transformation is carried out to minimize the probability of incorrect classification by the protected classifier and that of correct classification by the victim classifier. We conducted experiments targeting the state-of-the-art DeepSpeech voice recognition model using Mozilla Common Voice datasets and the Tensorflow library. They showed that the proposed method can generate a selective audio adversarial example with a 91.67% attack success rate and 85.67% protected classifier accuracy.

<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Online romance scams are a prevalent form of mass-marketing fraud in the West, and yet few studies have presented data-driven responses to this problem. In this type of scam, fraudsters craft fake profiles and manually interact with their victims. Because of the characteristics of this type of fraud and how dating sites operate, traditional detection methods (e.g., those used in spam filtering) are ineffective. In this paper, we investigate the archetype of online dating profiles used in this form of fraud, including their use of demographics, profile descriptions, and images, shedding light on both the strategies deployed by scammers to appeal to victims and the traits of victims themselves. Furthermore, in response to the severe financial and psychological harm caused by dating fraud, we develop a system to detect romance scammers on online dating platforms. This paper presents the first fully described system for automatically detecting this fraud. Our aim is to provide an early detection system to stop romance scammers as they create fraudulent profiles or before they engage with potential victims. Previous research has indicated that the victims of romance scams score highly on scales for idealized romantic beliefs. We combine a range of structured, unstructured, and deep-learned features that capture these beliefs in order to build a detection system. Our ensemble machine-learning approach is robust to the omission of profile details and performs at high accuracy (97%) in a hold-out validation set. The system enables development of automated tools for dating site providers and individual users.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We investigate the effect of outdated channel state information (CSI) on the secrecy performance of wireless-powered untrusted relay networks, in which the relay is a potential eavesdropper. To keep the information secret from this untrusted relay, the destination sends a jamming signal to the relay when the source transmits an information signal. At the same time, the relay harvests energy from the radio-frequency power, and forwards the received signals to the destination using this harvested energy. To determine the proportions of energy harvesting and information processing, the relay makes use of relaying based on power splitting or time switching policy. Although the destination tries to remove the jamming signal from the relaying signal, it cannot cancel out the jamming signal perfectly due to imperfect channel reciprocity caused by the outdated CSI; this residual jamming signal therefore has a negative impact on secrecy performance. In this scenario, we derive the closed-form expressions for the outage probability and average secrecy rate, and find the jamming power ratio, power splitting ratio, and time switching ratio to optimize these secrecy performance metrics. The numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of our analysis, and show that the proposed secure relaying protocols achieve a near-optimal secrecy performance, as well as outperforming the conventional scheme without the jamming power control.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Benefiting from the quick development of deep convolutional neural networks, especially fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), remarkable progresses have been achieved on salient object detection recently. Nevertheless, these FCNs based methods are still challenging to generate high resolution saliency maps, and also not applicable for subsequent applications due to their heavy model weights. In this paper, we propose a compact and efficient deep network with high accuracy for salient object detection. Firstly, we propose two strategies for initial prediction, one is a new designed multi-scale context module, the other is incorporating hand-crafted saliency priors. Secondly, we employ residual learning to refine it progressively by only learning the residual in each side-output, which can be achieved with few convolutional parameters, therefore leads to high compactness and high efficiency. Finally, we further design a novel top-down reverse attention block to guide the above side-output residual learning. Specifically, the current predicted salient regions are used to erase its side-output feature, thus the missing object parts and details can be efficiently learned from these unerased regions, which results in more complete detection and high accuracy. Extensive experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed network performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches, and shows advantages in simplicity, compactness and efficiency.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Seismic image interpolation is a currently popular research subject in modern reflection seismology. The interpolation problem is generally treated as a process of inversion. Under the compressed sensing framework, various sparse transformations and low-rank constraints based methods have great performances in recovering irregularly missing traces. However, in the case of regularly missing traces, their applications are limited because of the strong spatial aliasing energies. In addition, the erratic noise always poses a serious impact on the interpolation results obtained by the sparse transformations and low-rank constraints-based methods,. This is because the erratic noise is far from satisfying the statistical assumption behind these methods. In this study, we propose a mathematical morphology-based interpolation technique, which constrains the morphological scale of the model in the inversion process. The inversion problem is solved by the shaping regularization approach. The mathematical morphological constraint (MMC)-based interpolation technique has a satisfactory robustness to the spatial aliasing and erratic energies. We provide a detailed algorithmic framework and discuss the extension from 2D to higher dimensional version and the back operator in the shaping inversion. A group of numerical examples demonstrates the successful performance of the proposed technique.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we develop a concise but efficient network architecture called linear compressing based skip-connecting network (LCSCNet) for image super-resolution. Compared with two representative network architectures with skip connections, ResNet and DenseNet, a linear compressing layer is designed in LCSCNet for skip connection, which connects former feature maps and distinguishes them from newly-explored feature maps. In this way, the proposed LCSCNet enjoys the merits of the distinguish feature treatment of DenseNet and the parameter-economic form of ResNet. Moreover, to better exploit hierarchical information from both low and high levels of various receptive fields in deep models, inspired by gate units in LSTM, we also propose an adaptive element-wise fusion strategy with multi-supervised training. Experimental results in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms validate the effectiveness of LCSCNet.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Super-resolution phase retrieval is an inverse problem that appears in diffractive optical imaging (DOI) and consists in estimating a high-resolution image from low-resolution phaseless measurements. DOI has three diffraction zones where the data can be acquired, known as near, middle, and far fields. Recent works have studied super-resolution phase retrieval under a setup that records coded diffraction patterns at the near and far fields. However, the attainable resolution of the image is mainly governed by the sensor characteristics, whose cost increases in proportion to the resolution. Also, these methodologies lack theoretical analysis. Hence, this work derives super-resolution models from low-resolution coded phaseless measurements at any diffraction zone that in contrast to prior contributions, the attainable resolution of the image is determined by the resolution of the coded aperture. For the proposed models, the existence of a unique solution (up to a global unimodular constant) is guaranteed with high probability, which can be increased by designing the coded aperture. Therefore, a strategy that designs the spatial distribution of the coded aperture is developed. Additionally, a super-resolution phase retrieval algorithm that minimizes a smoothed nonconvex least-squares objective function is proposed. The method first approximates the image by a spectral algorithm, which is then refined based upon a sequence of alternate steps. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm overcomes state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing the high-resolution image. In addition, the reconstruction quality using designed coded apertures is higher than that of the non-designed ensembles.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Previous research on no-reference (NR) quality assessment of multiply-distorted images focused mainly on three distortion types (white noise, Gaussian blur, and JPEG compression), while in practice images can be contaminated by many other common distortions due to the various stages of processing. Although MUSIQUE (MUltiply- and Singly-distorted Image QUality Estimator) [Zhang et al., TIP 2018] is a successful NR algorithm, this approach is still limited to the three distortion types. In this paper, we extend MUSIQUE to MUSIQUE-II to blindly assess the quality of images corrupted by five distortion types (white noise, Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, JPEG2000 compression, and contrast change) and their combinations. The proposed MUSIQUE-II algorithm builds upon the classification and parameter-estimation framework of its predecessor by using more advanced models and a more comprehensive set of distortion-sensitive features. Specifically, MUSIQUE-II relies on a three-layer classification model to identify 19 distortion types. To predict the five distortion parameter values, MUSIQUE-II extracts an additional 14 contrast features and employs a multi-layer probability-weighting rule. Finally, MUSIQUE-II employs a new most-apparent-distortion strategy to adaptively combine five quality scores based on outputs of three classification models. Experimental results tested on three multiply-distorted and six singly-distorted image quality databases show that MUSIQUE-II yields not only a substantial improvement in quality predictive performance as compared with its predecessor, but also highly competitive performance relative to other state-of-the-art FR/NR IQA algorithms.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, an intelligent data-driven optimization scheme is proposed for finding the proper burden surface distribution, which exerts large influences on keeping blast furnace running smoothly in an energy-efficient state. In the proposed scheme, production indicators prediction models are first developed using a kernel extreme learning machine algorithm. To heel, burden surface decision is presented as a multiobjective optimization problem for the first time and solved by a modified two-stage intelligent optimization strategy to generate the initial setting values of burden surface. Furthermore, considering the existence of the approximation error of the created prediction models, feedback compensation is implemented to enhance the reliability of the results, in which an improved association rule mining method is developed to find the corrected values to compensate the initial setting values. Finally, we apply the proposed optimization scheme to determine the setting values of burden surface using actual data, and experimental results illustrate its effectiveness and feasibility.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, we develop a navigation strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for mobile robots. Because of the large difference between simulation and reality, most of the trained DRL models cannot be directly migrated into real robots. Moreover, how to explore in a sparsely rewarded environment is also a long-standing problem of DRL. This article proposes an end-to-end navigation planner that translates sparse laser ranging results into movement actions. Using this highly abstract data as input, agents trained by simulation can be extended to the real scene for practical application. For map-less navigation across obstacles and traps, it is difficult to reach the target via random exploration. Curiosity is used to encourage agents to explore the state of an environment that has not been visited and as an additional reward for exploring behavior. The agent relies on the self-supervised model to predict the next state, based on the current state and the executed action. The prediction error is used as a measure of curiosity. The experimental results demonstrate that without any manual design features and previous demonstrations, the proposed method accomplishes map-less navigation in complex environments. Through a reward signal that is enhanced by intrinsic motivation, the agent explores more efficiently, and the learned strategy is more reliable.

<p>Artificial intelligence methods applied in smart home environments can give a ubiquitous support of people, provide automatic control of system settings to lower the costs of operation, improve energetic efficiency, and longer endurance of components. In this article, we discuss the use of neural networks and rule-based systems as the components of automatic control over house elements. In the proposed framework, we store the knowledge and teach the system about the home in parallel to operation. Initially, the system starts with global settings, however, data are collected during use and parallel to this regular training is run so when the new knowledge guarantees higher efficiency, the system switch to use it. We have developed a new neural-based mechanism with rules control method to lower the costs of operation while keeping the needs of users. The components were tested and discussed due to practical application in our everyday life.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In modern Internet of Things (IoT), visual analysis and predictions are often performed by deep learning models. Salient object detection (SOD) is a fundamental preprocessing for these applications. Executing SOD on the fog devices is a challenging task due to the diversity of data and fog devices. To adopt convolutional neural networks (CNN) on fog&#x2013;cloud infrastructures for SOD-based applications, we introduce a semisupervised adversarial learning method in this article. The proposed model, named as SaliencyGAN, is empowered by a novel concatenated generative adversarial network (GAN) framework with partially shared parameters. The backbone CNN can be chosen flexibly based on the specific devices and applications. In the meanwhile, our method uses both the labeled and unlabeled data from different problem domains for training. Using multiple popular benchmark datasets, we compared state-of-the-art baseline methods to our SaliencyGAN obtained with 10&#x2013;100&#x0025; labeled training data. SaliencyGAN gained performance comparable to the supervised baselines when the percentage of labeled data reached 30&#x0025;, and outperformed the weakly supervised and unsupervised baselines. Furthermore, our ablation study shows that SaliencyGAN were more robust to the common &#x201c;mode missing&#x201d; (or &#x201c;mode collapse&#x201d;) issue compared to the selected popular GAN models. The visualized ablation results have proved that SaliencyGAN learned a better estimation of data distributions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first IoT-oriented semisupervised SOD method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Scheduling of a hot strip mill is an important decision problem in the steel manufacturing industry. Previous studies on the hot strip mill scheduling problem have mostly neglected the random factors in production. However, random variations in processing times are inevitable due to unpredictable delays and disturbances. In this article, we adopt a robust optimization approach to deal with the uncertainty in processing times. The advantage is that no assumption has to be made regarding the distribution of random data, and the obtained schedule will remain strictly feasible when the variations have not exceeded a predefined uncertainty set. First, a mixed-integer linear programming model is presented to formulate the robust scheduling problem. Then, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm, which combines ant colony system (ACS) and enhanced local search, is proposed to provide an efficient solution to the problem. Finally, extensive computational experiments involving both randomly generated and real-world instances have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. It is shown that the algorithm achieves optimality for small instances and outperforms two state-of-the-art metaheuristics when used to solve large instances.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The rotor structure of synchronous reluctance machines (SynRel) is conventionally retained mechanically by iron ribs. In this paper, a novel structure for high-speed synchronous reluctance rotor is presented. The novelty of this paper is the proof of a concept of SynRel machine without iron ribs. Structurally, the rotor iron lamination segments are embedded in an adhesive resin material with high temperature resistance and mechanical strength. Three four-pole SynRel machines have been designed with the target of improving motor torque, and compared for different ribs configuration. It has been shown that the proposed motor performs enhanced torque, power factor, and efficiency with respect to conventional SynRel with iron ribs. An extensive sensitivity analysis of the ribless rotor geometry is carried out, followed by both mechanical analysis and experimental over speed test to guarantee its robustness above the operating speed range. The manufacturing procedure of this novel rotor is introduced. Finally, the experimental results on both SynRel prototypes are presented, showing the increase in torque, power factor, and efficiency of the proposed solution. This paper is a first step toward the definition of a viable and novel solution of SynRel machines with improved performance.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>DC winding induced voltage pulsation in wound field switched flux (WFSF) machines causes dc winding current ripple and field excitation fluctuation, challenges the dc power source, and deteriorates the control performance. Hence, reducing this pulsation is important in the design of a WFSF machine. In this paper, based on the analytical models, rotor skewing and rotor iron piece pairing are proposed and comparatively investigated by the finite-element (FE) method to reduce the on-load dc winding induced voltage in WFSF machines having partitioned stators and concentrated ac windings. FE results show that peak-to-peak value of the on-load dc winding induced voltage in the analyzed 12&#x002f;10-pole partitioned stator WFSF (PS-WFSF) machines can be reduced by 78.42&#x0025; or 77.16&#x0025; by using rotor skewing or rotor pairing, respectively, while the torque density can be maintained by &gt;90&#x0025;. As for the 12&#x002f;11-, 12&#x002f;13-, and 12&#x002f;14-pole PS-WFSF machines, by using rotor iron piece inner arc pairing, the on-load dc winding induced voltage can be reduced by 64.11&#x0025;, 52.12&#x0025;, and 76.49&#x0025;, respectively, while the torque density can be maintained by more than 90&#x0025;. Prototypes are built and tested to verify the analytical and FE results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Squirrel-cage induction motor (SQIM) fed by a pulsewidth modulated voltage source inverter (VSI) is subjected to voltage and current surges. It may cause additional losses in the motor, insulation failure, high bearing current, and electromagnetic interference. To mitigate these problems, sinusoidal LC filter is placed at the ac-side of the VSI. This paper proposes a new methodology to design the filter. In this method, the filter inductance is chosen based on the maximum ripple in the inverter ac-side current and the voltage drop across the filter inductor, and the filter capacitor is chosen based on the steady-state reactive power demand of the SQIM. The effects of the designed filter on the switch current, losses in the drive, temperature of the dc-link capacitor, dv&#x002f;dt at the motor terminal, stator flux, and air-gap torque of the SQIM are discussed. The performance of the drive with the filters, designed by the proposed method and the standard method, are experimentally tested on a two-level silicon carbide VSI-fed SQIM and comparative analysis is carried out. The impact of the designed filter on the drive is also shown when the neutral point of the filter capacitors is connected with the mid-point of the dc link. The stability of the closed-loop controlled SQIM drive with the proposed filter, and simulation results are presented to verify its performance.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The fast detection of magnitude, frequency, and phase angle of the fundamental-frequency component is very useful in many three-phase power system applications. Most techniques to accomplish this task are based on different versions of three-phase phase-locked loop (PLL) schemes. Some variables of three-phase systems may experience phase angle jumps after some disturbances. In this paper, a method for the fast detection of phase angle jump occurrence, estimation of the phase angle jump, and its use for improving the performance of the generalized delayed signal cancelation (GDSC) PLL is proposed. The proposed method is based on the detailed evaluation of the GDSC filter transient behavior after a phase jump. Results considering typical three-phase grid disturbances are used to evaluate the proposed scheme, in comparison with other usual PLL techniques. The use of the proposed phase jump angle estimator allowed a reduction in the GDSC-PLL convergence time of about 50&#x0025;.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The relative pose control problem for spacecraft rendezvous and docking missions in the presence of control input constraints, actuator&#x0027;s partial failures, and unknown external disturbances is studied in this paper. A smoothly adaptive fault-tolerant constrained controller is developed based on the adaptive nonlinear state feedback method. Different from the traditional fault-tolerant saturated controllers, the proposed control approach explicitly accounts for the control input constraints with straightforward tuning parameters in controller. Meanwhile, the exact knowledge of the actuator failures is not required and uncertain failure information can be rejected. A smooth control signal containing simple saturation functions is designed, and the unknown bounded external disturbances can be rejected by the proposed method. The proposed controller can ensure ultimately, uniformly bounded stability of the closed-loop system, where relative pose and velocities converge to the small neighborhoods of zero. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.
