<p>She's been called the greatest Secretary-General the UN never had.

It was quite painful. Nobody likes losing&#8221;, she says. But Clark also prides herself on being resilient and takes some comfort in knowing her bid for the top UN job has created a few more cracks in that glass ceiling. &#8220;I'm quite confident that there are strong women who can do that job and I hope that I've helped create a platform for them to be seen and heard.&#8221;

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Heart failure is a common syndrome associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The management of symptoms and the strategies for improving prognosis have largely been based on pharmacological treatments. The pathophysiology of heart failure is complex because of the multiple causes responsible for this syndrome. This Series paper presents some examples of advances in heart failure management, in which the treatment specifically targets the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the symptoms.

<p>In heart failure, extensive evaluation with modern non-invasive imaging modalities is needed to assess causes, pathophysiology, and haemodynamics, to determine prognosis and consider therapeutic options. This systematic evaluation includes a stepwise assessment of left ventricular size and function, the presence and severity of coronary artery disease, mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dilation and dysfunction, and tricuspid regurgitation. Based on this imaging-derived information, the need for specific therapies besides optimised medical therapy can be determined.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Privacy against an adversary (AD) that tries to detect the underlying privacy-sensitive data distribution is studied. The original data sequence is assumed to come from one of the two known distributions, and the privacy leakage is measured by the probability of error of the binary hypothesis test carried out by the AD. A management unit (MU) is allowed to manipulate the original data sequence in an online fashion while satisfying an average distortion constraint. The goal of the MU is to maximize the minimal type II probability of error subject to a constraint on the type I probability of error assuming an adversarial Neyman&#x2013;Pearson test, or to maximize the minimal error probability assuming an adversarial Bayesian test. The asymptotic exponents of the maximum minimal type II probability of error and the maximum minimal error probability are shown to be characterized by a Kullback&#x2013;Leibler divergence rate and a Chernoff information rate, respectively. Privacy performances of particular management policies, the memoryless hypothesis-aware policy and the hypothesis-unaware policy with memory, are compared. The proposed formulation can also model adversarial example generation with minimal data manipulation to fool classifiers. At last, the results are applied to a smart meter privacy problem, where the user&#x2019;s energy consumption is manipulated by adaptively using a renewable energy source in order to hide user&#x2019;s activity from the energy provider.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The existing malware analysis platforms leave detectable fingerprints such as uncommon string properties in QEMU, signatures in Android Java virtual machine, and artifacts in Linux kernel profiles. Since these fingerprints provide the malware a chance to split its behavior depending on whether the analysis system is present or not, the existing analysis systems are not sufficient to analyze the sophisticated malware. In this paper, we propose NINJA, a transparent malware analysis framework on the ARM platform with low artifacts. NINJA leverages a hardware-assisted isolated execution environment TrustZone to transparently trace and debug a target application with the help of performance monitor unit and embedded trace macrocell. These hardware features help NINJA to achieve transparency while avoiding heavy performance overhead. NINJA does not modify system software and is OS-agnostic on the ARM platform. We implement a prototype of NINJA (i.e., tracing and debugging subsystems), and the experimental results show that NINJA is efficient and transparent for malware analysis. An improved fast system restoration mechanism is also designed to facilitate the continuous malware analysis.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In recent years, physical layer security has been regarded as a promising technique to facilitate secure communications in next generation mobile systems, where theoretically massive MIMO can significantly enhance the system secrecy performance under its advantage in shaping the transmitted signals to null the interference or leakage. However, in practical systems, the achievable secrecy performance under imperfect channel state information (CSI) deserves further investigation. In this paper, we give a detailed analysis about the physical layer security problem in a multi-user massive MIMO system with imperfect CSI. The considered imperfect CSI includes both the outdated CSI due to the transmission and processing delay, and the channel estimation error. We first derive a tight asymptotic lower bound of the ergodic system secrecy capacity under imperfect CSI, and then analyze how imperfect CSI affects the system secrecy performance. Moreover, we propose a channel prediction scheme that can result in more accurate CSI, in order to alleviate the negative effect on the achievable system secrecy capacity caused by imperfect CSI. Simulation results reveal that the imperfect CSI greatly reduces the system secrecy capacity, while our designed channel prediction scheme can effectively mitigate the harmful impact of imperfect CSI and thus improve the system secrecy performance.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The cloud-enabled Internet of controlled things (IoCT) envisions a network of sensors, controllers, and actuators connected through a local cloud in order to intelligently control physical devices. Because cloud services are vulnerable to advanced persistent threats (APTs), each device in the IoCT must strategically decide whether to trust cloud services that may be compromised. In this paper, we present iSTRICT, an interdependent strategic trust mechanism for the cloud-enabled IoCT. iSTRICT is composed of three interdependent layers. In the cloud layer, iSTRICT uses FlipIt games to conceptualize APTs. In the communication layer, it captures the interaction between devices and the cloud using signaling games. In the physical layer, iSTRICT uses optimal control to quantify the utilities in the higher level games. Best response dynamics link the three layers in an overall &#x201c;game-of-games,&#x201d; for which the outcome is captured by a concept called Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE). We prove the existence of a GNE under a set of natural assumptions and develop an adaptive algorithm to iteratively compute the equilibrium. Finally, we apply iSTRICT to trust management for autonomous vehicles that rely on measurements from remote sources. We show that strategic trust in the communication layer achieves a worst-case probability of compromise for any attack and defense costs in the cyber layer.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a new multi-input multi-output (MIMO) dc&#x2013;dc converter with high step-up capability is proposed for wide power ranges. Also, in order to increase each output voltage, diode&#x2013;capacitor voltage multiplier (VM) stages are utilized in the proposed converter. The number of input stages, output stages, and VM stages are arbitrary and dependent on design conditions. At first, the general structure of proposed MIMO converter is presented. Then, in order to explain the converter operation, we walk through the design of a 1-kW four-input two-output example, including loss and efficiency calculations. We validate the design with a prototype that matches efficiency calculations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel bilinear projections model for unsupervised learning, which can be directly applied to dimension reduction and feature extraction for image analysis. Compared to previous 2-dimensional (2D) methods, our method seeks multiple rank- $k$  bilinear projections (MRBP), which makes a balance between two opposite problems of enhancing the degree of freedom and avoiding the problem of over-fitting by adjusting  $k$ . Besides, each renewed feature in our method is extracted independently, rather than dimensions reduced by row or column like before, and thus our reduced dimension is not restricted by the size of a sample. In addition, we demonstrate that our model could be optimized via two equivalent optimization problems based on the criteria of maximum separability and nearest reconstruction respectively. Motivated by this, the corresponding robust version (RMRBP) achieving a better performance to occluded data is introduced as well. Extensive experiments on several datasets have been done to verify the effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The autonomous operation of industrial robots with minimal human supervision has always been in high demand. To prepare the autonomous operation of a car part spray painting robot, novel object detection, and pose estimation algorithms have been developed in this paper. The object detection part used principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of three-dimensional (3-D) point cloud to 2-D binary image. Distance measure between the auto and cross correlation of the binary features was established to find out the similarity between them. Resultantly, the type of auto part was successfully obtained. Furthermore, iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm was used to estimate the pose difference of the auto part with respect to the camera reference frame, which was mounted on the robot. An issue with ICP&#x0027;s lack of robustness to local minimum was solved by the combination of ICP and genetic algorithm (GA). This allowed the optimization of pose error and addressed the problem of local minimum entrapment in ICP. For experimental validation: the proposed object recognition pipeline was implemented in both serial and parallel programming paradigms. The results were obtained for the acquired point clouds of side body car parts and compared with the major 3-D object detection systems in terms of computational cost. Pose estimation error was calculated with both ICP and the modified point set registration schemes, and it was shown to be decreasing in the case of later. All shown results supported the research claims.

<p><span class="paragraphSection"><strong>To the Editor</strong> The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended high-intensity counseling for adults with obesity, followed by regular contact for maintenance of weight loss. The task force did not issue recommendations for pharmacotherapy because of (1) perceived lack of generalizability of the clinical trial findings, owing to stringent inclusion criteria and run-in periods; (2) high rates of dropout in the trials; and (3) lack of data &#8220;about the maintenance of improvement after discontinuation of pharmacotherapy.&#8221;</span>

<p><span class="paragraphSection">Over the past decade, nutritional psychiatry has developed into a promising research area in a field with great unmet need. The early research has advanced from cross-sectional epidemiological studies reporting associations between diet quality and mental health outcomes, including depression and anxiety, to longitudinal and mechanistic studies. Observational findings have been extensively replicated and documented in meta-analyses and are supported by intervention studies examining the efficacy of dietary improvement as a treatment for depression; recently, 2 preliminary trials of dietary interventions for depression have yielded similar positive findings. A new meta-analysis confirms that dietary interventions significantly reduce depressive symptoms, although nearly all studies to date have involved nonclinically depressed populations; that is, individuals with subsyndromal depressive symptoms, metabolic disorders, other somatic conditions, or healthy adults recruited from the general population. Thus, for the findings from these studies to serve as catalysts for clinical change, additional independent and methodologically rigorous interventions targeting depression are essential. In this issue of <span style="font-style: italic;">JAMA</span>, 2 randomized trials provide important results that focus on the emerging field of nutritional psychiatry.</span>

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this work, the design of a novel the flexure-linked dual-drive H-gantry is first introduced. Compared to conventional stacked X&#x2013;Y tables, the advantages of this gantry are on decoupled X&#x2013;Y actuation, better mechanical reliability, larger driving force, and shorter response time. However, after deriving its reduced-order dynamical model, it is found that the precision of the end-effector is significantly affected by the position dependent torque caused by the inter-parallel-axes driving forces on the fixed inertia frame and coupling forces from the pair of flexures. These form barriers that limit precision positioning and tracking performance over a large workspace. Thus, in the following part, a robust integral of signum of error (RISE) control with novel jerk adaptation is proposed on top of the standard proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and feedforward scheme. Compared with some prior RISE schemes with gain adaptation, the proposed scheme yields bounded robust gain in the presence of noisy velocity estimation. Real-time experiments on the actual testbed indicate that both improvement of motion precision and prevention of resonant mode excitation over a large workspace are successfully achieved in the proposed scheme.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Despite the recent advances on intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings, existing research works mostly assume training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution. However, due to variation of operating condition, domain shift phenomenon generally exists, which results in significant diagnosis performance deterioration. To address cross-domain problems, latest research works preferably apply domain adaptation techniques on marginal data distributions. However, it is usually assumed that sufficient testing data are available for training, that is not in accordance with most transfer tasks in real industries where only data in machine healthy condition can be collected in advance. This paper proposes a novel cross-domain fault diagnosis method based on deep generative neural networks. By artificially generating fake samples for domain adaptation, the proposed method is able to provide reliable cross-domain diagnosis results when testing data in machine fault conditions are not available for training. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method offers a promising approach for industrial applications.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>AC cascaded system is one of the basic components of the power conversion system in the modern more-electric aircraft (MEA). However, the ac cascaded system suffers from an instability problem, i.e., even if each subsystem is stable individually, the formed cascaded system may become unstable. Most of the existing stabilization methods are a linear control method, which is based on a small signal model and can only ensure small signal stability near the operation point in theory. Therefore, these existing linear stabilization methods may be ineffective to fix large-signal stability issues. In this paper, a large signal stability constraining dichotomy solution (SCDS)-based model predictive control (MPC) is proposed to improve the stability of the ac cascaded system in the MEA by the Lyapunov criteria. This approach first theoretically presents how to add the system stability item to the MPC cost function in an analytic way instead of using the traditional &#x201c;experience-based&#x201d; weight method. Besides, the SCDS-MPC itself is also an improvement to the existing finite control set MPC. It can realize a constant switching frequency and achieve better steady-state&#x002f;dynamic current control performance. Finally, a 1.5 kW ac cascaded system is fabricated in the laboratory to verify the proposed SCDS-MPC method.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Real-time Internet of Things (IoT) applications have stringent delay requirements when implemented over distributed sensing and communication networks in smart traffic control. They require the system to reach a permissible neighbourhood of an optimum solution with a tolerable delay. The performance of such applications mostly depends on the delay introduced by the underlying optimization algorithms, with the localized computational capability. In this paper, we study a smart traffic control scenario-a real-time IoT application, where a group of autonomous vehicles independently decide on their lane velocities, in collaboration with road-side units to efficiently utilize intersections with minimal environmental impact. We decompose this problem as an unconstrained network utility maximization problem. A consensus-based, constant step-size gradient descent algorithm is proposed to obtain a near-optimal solution. We analyze the delay-accuracy tradeoff in reaching a near-optimal velocity. Delay is measured in terms of the number of iterations required before the scheduling operation can be done for a particular tolerance. The operation of the algorithm under quantized message passing is also studied. On contrary to the existing methods to intersection management problems, our approach studies the limit at which an optimization algorithm fails to cater for the requirements of a real-time application and must fall back for a pareto-optimal solution, due to the communication constraints. We used simulation of urban mobility to incorporate the microscopic behavior of traffic flows to our simulations and compared our solution with traditional and state-of-the-art intersection management techniques.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fractional interpolation is used to provide sub-pixel level references for motion compensation in the interprediction of video coding, which attempts to remove temporal redundancy in video sequences. Traditional handcrafted fractional interpolation filters face the challenge of modeling discontinuous regions in videos, while existing deep learning-based methods are either designed for a single quantization parameter (QP), only generating half-pixel samples, or need to train a model for each sub-pixel position. In this paper, we present a one-for-all fractional interpolation method based on a grouped variation convolutional neural network (GVCNN). Our method can deal with video frames coded using different QPs and is capable of generating all sub-pixel positions at one sub-pixel level. Also, by predicting variations between integer-position pixels and sub-pixels, our network offers more expressive power. Moreover, we perform specific measurements in training data generation to simulate practical situations in video coding, including blurring the down-sampled sub-pixel samples to avoid aliasing effects and coding integer pixels to simulate reconstruction errors. In addition, we analyze the impact of the size of blur kernels theoretically. Experimental results verify the efficiency of GVCNN. Compared with HEVC, our method achieves 2.2% in bit saving on average and up to 5.2% under low-delay P configuration.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) botnets have become one of the major threats in network security for serving as the fundamental infrastructure for various cyber-crimes. More challenges are involved in the problem of detecting P2P botnets, despite a few work claimed to detect centralized botnets effectively. We propose an enhanced PeerHunter, a network-flow level community behavior analysis based system, to detect P2P botnets. Our system starts from a P2P network flow detection component. Then, it uses &#x201c;mutual contacts&#x201d; to cluster bots into communities. Finally, it uses network-flow level community behavior analysis to detect potential botnets. In the experimental evaluation, we propose two evasion attacks, where we assume the adversaries know our techniques in advance and attempt to evade our system by making the P2P bots mimic the behavior of legitimate P2P applications. Our results showed that enhanced PeerHunter can obtain high detection rate with few false positives, and high robustness against the proposed attacks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) is changing the way modern information systems that are designed, operated, and evolved. SOC makes possible to aggregate distributed resources at the phases of decision-making support and system operations. When myriads of resources with similar functionalities are available, effective methodologies are demanded to select services and compose them as service workflows for the specified goals. The computation for workflow composition is very complex since it depends on the numbers of services and their dynamic characteristics. Therefore, composing optimized workflows in a timely manner poses a great challenge. We are highly motivated to reduce the complexity of service selection and composition. The formalized semantics in SWSpec is extended so that unqualified or inferior services can be eliminated directly from the scope of the design solution space. In this paper, a brief review of the proposed SWSpec language is given and the focus is on the sematic formalization. A new compositional proof-system is developed with a set of inference rules and the proven system properties. The proposed semantic formalization has its great significance in reducing the complexity of composing workflows and developing efficient algorithms for compliance checking.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Uncertainty management is a challenging task in decision making of the operators of the power systems. Prediction of the system state is vital for the operation of a system with stochastic behavior especially in a power system with a significant amount of renewable energies such as wind power. Predictable power systems are in more interest of operators, of course. This paper proposes a multiobjective framework for optimal placement and parameters setting of a unified power flow controller (UPFC) considering system predictability. The well-known multiobjective nondominated sorting genetic algorithm is implemented to handle various objective functions such as active power losses and predictability of system in the presence of operational constraints and uncertainties. The point estimate method is used for modeling probabilistic nature of the wind power. Using the proposed method, statistical information of voltage magnitude and apparent power of converters of UPFCs can be obtained, which are very useful in making decision on the sizing of UPFCs. Comprehensive discussions are provided using the simulations on the IEEE 57-bus test system. Also, in order to validate the obtained results, a multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm is implemented and the results of two algorithms are compared with each other.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation is a technique that is being used increasingly in the development and test of complex systems. Real-world testing of an intricate system in a field-like power plant can be challenging, time-consuming, expensive, and hazardous. HIL emulators allow engineers to test devices thoroughly and efficiently in a virtual environment with high reliability and minimum risk of defect. In this paper, the complete electric power system (including generator, turbine-governor, excitation system, transmission lines, transformer, external grid and related loads) is implemented in a MATLAB&#x002f;Simulink environment. Different virtual instrument pages are modeled in the graphical programming language of LabVIEW which enable fast and reliable measurement functions such as data acquisition, archiving, real-time graphical display and processing. The interaction between MATLAB and LabVIEW is accomplished by generating a Pharlap ETS Targets <sup>&#x002a;</sup>.dll file which enables the two software to exchange real-time data. Also, a real 1518-kW excitation system is considered as a test case for the introduced HIL system. This equipment is connected to LabVIEW software through a National Instrument PXI technology. Different scenarios (electrical frequency&#x002f;active power change, voltage step response, etc.) are simulated in the designed power system emulator (PSE). The validity of the implemented model for the excitation system is verified by finding good matching between MATLAB and HIL simulation results.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Using multi-atlas registration (MAR), information carried by atlases can be transferred onto a new input image for the tasks of region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation, anatomical landmark detection, and so on. Conventional atlases used in MAR methods are monomodal and contain only normal anatomical structures. Therefore, the majority of MAR methods cannot handle input multimodal pathological images, which are often collected in routine image-based diagnosis. This is because registering monomodal atlases with normal appearances to multimodal pathological images involves two major problems: 1) missing imaging modalities in the monomodal atlases and 2) influence from pathological regions. In this paper, we propose a new MAR framework to tackle these problems. In this framework, deep learning-based image synthesizers are applied for synthesizing multimodal normal atlases from conventional monomodal normal atlases. To reduce the influence from pathological regions, we further propose a multimodal low-rank approach to recover multimodal normal-looking images from multimodal pathological images. Finally, the multimodal normal atlases can be registered to the recovered multimodal images in a multi-channel way. We evaluate our MAR framework via brain ROI segmentation of multimodal tumor brain images. Due to the utilization of multimodal information and the reduced influence from pathological regions, experimental results show that registration based on our method is more accurate and robust, leading to significantly improved brain ROI segmentation compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Stereoscopic saliency detection plays an important role in various stereoscopic video processing applications. However, conventional stereoscopic video saliency detection methods mainly use independent low-level features instead of extracting them automatically, and thus, they ignore the intrinsic relationship between the spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel stereoscopic video saliency detection method based on 3D convolutional neural networks, namely, deep 3D video saliency (Deep3DSaliency). The proposed network consists of two sub-models: spatiotemporal saliency model (STSM) and stereoscopic saliency aware model (SSAM). STSM directly takes three consecutive video frames as the input to extract visual spatiotemporal features, while SSAM attempts to further infer the depth and semantic features from the left and right video frames by shared parameters from STSM. The visual spatiotemporal features from STSM and the depth and semantic features from SSAM are learned by an alternating optimization scheme. Finally, all these saliency-related features are combined together for the final stereoscopic saliency detection via 3D deconvolution. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed model over other existing ones in saliency estimation for 3D video sequences.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The 360&#x00b0; video compression has two main challenges due to projection distortions, namely, the geometry distortion and the face boundary discontinuity. There are some tradeoffs between selecting equi-rectangular projection (ERP) and polyhedron projection. In ERP, the geometry distortion is severer than the face boundary discontinuity; while for the polyhedron projections, the face boundary discontinuity is severer than the geometry distortion. These two distortions will have side effects on the motion compensation and undermine the compression efficiency of the 360&#x00b0; video. In this paper, an integrated framework is developed to handle these two problems to improve coding efficiency. The proposed framework mainly has two key contributions. First, we derive a unified advanced spherical motion model to handle the geometry distortion of different projection formats for the 360&#x00b0; video. When fitting the projection between the various projection formats and the sphere into the unified framework, a specific solution can be obtained for each projection format. Second, we propose a local 3D padding method to handle the face boundary discontinuity between the neighboring faces in various projection formats of the 360&#x00b0; video. The local 3D padding method can be applied to different projection formats through setting different angles between neighboring faces. These two methods are independent of each other and can also be combined into an integrated framework to achieve a better rate-distortion performance. The proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into the latest video coding standard high-efficiency video coding. The experimental results demonstrate that introducing proposed coding tools can achieve significant bitrate savings compared with the current state-of-the-art method.
