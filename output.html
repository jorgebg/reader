<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>New strains of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have exhibited potential to disconnect communication networks, even cutting off entire countries from the Internet. The &#x201c;crossfire&#x201d; is a new, indirect DDoS link-flooding attack, which masks itself as natural congestion, making it very hard to counter. Several studies have proposed online attack detection schemes, whose efficiency has been shown to vary in different network topologies. However, the topology/detection relation has been studied qualitatively, without formal proof or quantification metric. This paper is motivated by the fact that network topology changes are generally expensive and slow. Therefore, network designers should be provided with means of evaluating the effects of topology modifications to the attack detection efficiency. This paper fills this gap by contributing a formal proof for the topology-detection efficiency relation, as well as a novel off-line metric that quantifies it. Full attack prototypes are implemented and evaluated in real-Internet topologies, validating the analytical findings. It is shown that the novel metric expresses the topology-detection relation efficiently, while existing and widely used metrics do not constitute good choices for this task.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Vulnerability of face recognition systems to presentation attacks has attracted increasing attention from the biometrics and forensics communities. Moreover, the recent availability of light field cameras is opening new possibilities for designing improved face presentation attack detection solutions. In this context, this paper provides the first review and benchmarking study in the literature on light field-based face presentation attack detection solutions. State-of-the-art solutions are assessed in terms of accuracy, generalization and complexity, using a common, representative evaluation framework. This paper also proposes a novel face presentation attack detection solution, based on a histogram of oriented gradients descriptor, which exploits the disparity information available in light field imaging. The evaluation of the proposed face presentation attack detection solution for different presentation attack types shows a very effective and stable performance, notably performing better than the state-of-the-art alternatives.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The classical Bloom filter data structure is a crucial component of hundreds of cryptographic protocols. It has been used in privacy preservation and secure computation settings, often in conjunction with the (somewhat) homomorphic properties of ciphers such as Paillier&#x2019;s. In 2014, a new data structure extending and surpassing the capabilities of the classical Bloom filter has been proposed. The new primitive, called spatial Bloom filter (SBF) retains the hash-based membership-query design of the Bloom filter, but applies it to elements from multiple sets. Since its introduction, the SBF has been used in the design of cryptographic protocols for a number of domains, including location privacy and network security. However, due to the complex nature of this probabilistic data structure, its properties had not been fully understood. In this paper, we address this gap in knowledge and we fully explore the probabilistic properties of the SBF. In doing so, we define a number of metrics (such as emersion and safeness) useful in determining the parameters needed to achieve certain characteristics in a filter, including the false positive probability and inter-set error rate. This will in turn enable the design of more efficient cryptographic protocols based on the SBF, opening the way to their practical application in a number of security and privacy settings.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The principle of compressed sensing (CS) can be applied in a cryptosystem by providing the notion of security. The Gaussian one-time sensing (G-OTS) CS-based cryptosystem employing a random Gaussian matrix and renewing the elements at each encryption is known to be perfectly secure, as long as each plaintext has constant energy. A random Bernoulli matrix can replace the Gaussian one for encrypting each plaintext efficiently in the Bernoulli one-time sensing (B-OTS) cryptosystem. In this paper, we analyze the security of G-OTS and B-OTS cryptosystems, respectively, where each cryptosystem may have unequal plaintext energy. By means of probability metrics, we study the indistinguishability of each CS-based cryptosystem, which formalizes the notion of computational security. Moreover, we investigate how much the indistinguishability is sensitive to energy variation of plaintexts in each cryptosystem. For the B-OTS cryptosystem, we analyze the indistinguishability and the energy sensitivity in a non-asymptotic manner for a finite plaintext length. In conclusion, this paper confirms that G-OTS and B-OTS cryptosystems can be strictly and asymptotically indistinguishable, respectively, as long as each plaintext has constant energy, but the indistinguishability is highly sensitive to energy variation of plaintexts.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we consider the design of a new secure transmission scheme for a four-node relay-eavesdropper channel, where user cooperation is used to facilitate secure communications. The key idea of the proposed achievable scheme is to apply the compression relaying concept of noisy network coding (NNC) to the secrecy communication scenario. But different from the original non-secrecy NNC, the compression rate at the relay is adaptively chosen according to the eavesdropping channel. Particularly, helping interference information is injected into the compression codebook at the relay by simply enlarging the compression rate, which is to effectively suppress the eavesdropping channel. Closed-form expressions of the secrecy rates achieved by the proposed NNC-based secure scheme are characterized for both the discrete memoryless and Gaussian relay-eavesdropper channels, where the optimal compression rate and the optimal transmit power at the relay are also determined. The proposed secure scheme can be viewed as a general framework, which naturally combines the NNC compression relaying scheme with the interference-assisted scheme. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed secure scheme offers constant performance gains over typical existing cooperative secure schemes.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a new method for fast radial vibration computation in switched reluctance motors. Only a piecewise first-order linear function is used to calculate the total peak acceleration, which is rather fast. The overall radial vibration is the superposition of natural oscillation of each mode. Before that, several critical parameters need to be calculated or measured in advance, including weight factor, natural frequency and damping ratio of each mode, in order to obtain the respective analytical expression of natural oscillation of each mode. First, the total peak acceleration concerning the multiple of current and its slope is derived analytically from the perspective of abrupt change of radial force. Then, a simple method for calculating weight factors is presented for the distribution of peak acceleration of each mode from the total peak acceleration. Natural frequencies are measured and compared by three methods, including finite-element analysis, hammer impulse test, and dc pulse excitation. The calculation of damping ratio is improved since the traditional damping ratio calculation method cannot be used in a multiple degree-of-freedom system. Finally, both simulation and experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Generally, the modal degeneration problem existed in the design of ultrasonic motors using composite vibration modes can be overcome by adopting the same-order orthogonal-bending composite vibrations. The conventional excitation and the modified hybrid one of sandwich type orthogonal-bending composite vibrations with the same order are compared and analyzed in this paper. Compared with the conventional one, the modified hybrid excitation favors that two groups of ceramics exciting two orthogonal-bending modes are placed in the optimum excitation position. Moreover, the modified hybrid excitation can achieve larger vibration amplitude than the conventional one, while the amount of the ceramics adopted and the exciting voltages applied are the same. The first-order orthogonal-bending composite vibrations are chosen to analyze the advantage of the modified hybrid excitation. Finite-element method is adopted to compare the amplitudes of the models with the same sizes but different excitations. The prototypes corresponding to two excitations are fabricated and tested to verify the results of the theory and simulation. It is proved that the modified hybrid excitation can improve the performance of the sandwich type ultrasonic motors using bending composite vibrations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The common method of improving efficiency when a synchronous buck converter operates at a light load is to adopt a current sensor to generate a turn-off command for the synchronous rectifying switch (SRS). However, a current-sensing technique with passive components is easily affected by noise and ringing, causing abnormal switching of the SRS. This study presents a simple control scheme for determining the zero point of an inductor current. It utilizes ripple voltage generated by a charging/discharging behavior from the capacitor to emulate the inductor current without using current sensors. The control strategy is verified by developing a 25-W synchronous rectifier buck converter.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A common ground switched-quasi-Z-source bidirectional dc&#x2013;dc converter is proposed for electric vehicles with hybrid energy sources. The proposed converter is based on the traditional two-level quasi- Z-source bidirectional dc&#x2013;dc converter, changing the position of the main power switch. It has the advantages of a wide-voltage-gain range, a lower voltage stress across the power switches, and an absolute common ground. The operating principle, the voltage and current stresses on the power switches, the comparisons with the other converters, the small signal analysis, and the controller design are presented in this paper. Finally, a 300&#x00a0;W prototype with $U_{{rm{high}}}= {240  rm{V}}$  and $U_{{rm{low}}}= {40sim 120 rm{V}}$  is developed, and the experimental results validate the performance and the feasibility of the proposed converter.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Cooperative dual-crane lifting is an important but challenging process involved in heavy and critical lifting tasks. This paper considers the path planning for the cooperative dual-crane lifting. It aims to automatically generate optimal dual-crane lifting paths under multiple constraints, i.e., collision avoidance, coordination between the two cranes, and balance of the lifting target. Previous works often used oversimplified models for the dual-crane lifting system, the lifting environment, and the motion of the lifting target. They were thus limited to simple lifting cases and might even lead to unsafe paths in some cases. We develop a novel path planner for dual-crane lifting that can quickly produce optimized paths in complex 3-D environments. The planner has fully considered the kinematic structure of the lifting system. Therefore, it is able to robustly handle the nonlinear movement of the suspended target during lifting. The effectiveness and efficiency of the planner are enabled by three novel aspects: 1) a comprehensive and computationally efficient mathematical modeling of the lifting system; 2) a new multiobjective parallel genetic algorithm designed to solve the path planning problem; and 3) a new efficient approach to perform continuous collision detection for the dual-crane lifting target. The planner has been tested in complex industrial environments. The results show that the planner can generate dual-crane lifting paths that are easy for conductions and optimized in terms of costs for complex environments. Comparisons with two previous methods demonstrate the advantages of the planner, including safer paths, higher success rates, and the ability to handle general lifting cases.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a precise and robust localization framework for autonomous vehicles. In contrast to simultaneous localization and mapping, localization and mapping in our method are separate (i.e., first mapping and then localization within this map). The map used in this paper is a 3-D occupancy map that is generated from a stitched point cloud. For localization, a hybrid filtering framework is proposed to match the live data with the prior map. In the upper layer, odometer data, IMU data, and the map matching result are fused by a cubature Kalman filter, which will limit the predictive pose within a reasonable bound. In the lower layer, the map matching problem is converted into a point set registration problem that is solved using a particle filter, which will make the matching result robust to local minima. This hybrid scheme makes localization more robust to convergence to a local minimum, which is often encountered in the localization task for autonomous vehicles. This method can also guarantee decimeter-level precision in industrial environments. Experiments demonstrate the validity of this method and also show that it outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a differential evolution algorithm with a new encoding mechanism for efficiently solving the optimal layout of the wind farm, with the aim of maximizing the power output. In the modeling of the wind farm, the wake effects among different wind turbines are considered and the Weibull distribution is employed to estimate the wind speed distribution. In the process of evolution, a new encoding mechanism for the locations of wind turbines is designed based on the characteristics of the wind farm layout. This encoding mechanism is the first attempt to treat the location of each wind turbine as an individual. As a result, the whole population represents a layout. Compared with the traditional encoding, the advantages of this encoding mechanism are twofold: 1) the dimension of the search space is reduced to two, and 2) a crucial parameter (i.e., the population size) is eliminated. In addition, differential evolution serves as the search engine and the caching technique is adopted to enhance the computational efficiency. The comparative analysis between the proposed method and seven other state-of-the-art methods is conducted based on two wind scenarios. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is able to obtain the best overall performance, in terms of the power output and execution time.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper addresses the time-delay effects of the wide-area monitoring and control systems (WAMCS) in smart power grids which may critically impact system stability. The main purpose is to conduct a detailed delay analysis of the WAMCS in case of grid contingences. This analysis is performed via an advanced WAMCS testbed where a flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) device is utilized and controlled via a wide-area controller (WAC). Phasor measurements units (PMUs) are adopted to collect the real-time measurements for the WAC. The testbed results from an interface of four main segments known as the WAC; the actual FACTS device, the local area controller, and the power grid system along with the PMUs are simulated via a real-time digital simulator. To mimic the real case scenario, both hardware-in-the-loop and software-in-the-loop schemes are adopted in the experimental testbed, considering time-delay effects. The results obtained clarify the effect of delay in WAMCS in case of smart grid contingences.
