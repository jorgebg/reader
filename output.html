<p>Writing in the third volume of his Treatise of Human Nature in 1740, the Edinburgh philosopher, David Hume, investigated the idea of justice. Hume was a sceptic. He resisted the prevailing rationalism of the time, theological and secular. The belief that abstract reason was the path to truth and, therefore, a guide to life. No. The only reliance we could place on anything came from our experience. Hume wanted to be to morality what Newton was to mechanics. Hume denied that there were natural and essential differences between right and wrong, good and evil, justice and injustice.

<p>Do traits like positivity, stubbornness, and hard work affect longevity? One study of Italian nonagenarians and centenarians suggested that the answer is yes. Researchers reported that, despite their declining physical health, this group of older Italians continued to control their social lives and refused to stop working the land. Their &#8220;exceptional longevity&#8221;, the authors suggested, was intimately linked to &#8220;a balance between acceptance of and grit to overcome adversities&#8221;, and a commitment to their purpose in life.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Even as an experimental vaccine is being deployed to limit the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), provision of the clinical care necessary for improving survival among infected patients must also be prioritised. During the early part of the 2013&#8211;16 west African epidemic when intravenous fluids were not readily available, the nearly four&#8211;fold difference in mortality between patients treated in high&#8211;income countries (18&#183;5%) compared with those managed in west Africa (70&#183;8%) suggests that aggressive hydration, among other measures, could improve outcomes.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The accurate measurement of security metrics is a critical research problem, because an improper or inaccurate measurement process can ruin the usefulness of the metrics. This is a highly challenging problem, particularly when the ground truth is unknown or noisy. In this paper, we measure five malware detection metrics in the absence of ground truth, which is a realistic setting that imposes many technical challenges. The ultimate goal is to develop principled, automated methods for measuring these metrics at the maximum accuracy possible. The problem naturally calls for investigations into statistical estimators by casting the measurement problem as a statistical estimation problem. We propose statistical estimators for these five malware detection metrics. By investigating the statistical properties of these estimators, we characterize when the estimators are accurate, and what adjustments can be made to improve them under what circumstances. We use synthetic data with known ground truth to validate these statistical estimators. Then, we employ these estimators to measure five metrics with respect to a large data set collected from VirusTotal.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Leakage models, regarded as a bridge between the physical signal and the sensitive operation, have a great influence on the effectiveness of the side channel analysis. The existing leakage models are usually divided into two categories, the non-profiled leakage models which have been chosen before sampling and analyzing, such as Hamming weight and Hamming distance, while the profiled leakage models, whose parameters have to be trained in the profiling phase, such as the Stochastic model of which both coefficient vector and pooled covariance matrix are required to be estimated based on the acquired samples. In general, a profiled leakage model is more accurate than a non-profiled one. However, it may lead to an inefficient attack if the leakage function is inaccurate, e.g., the over-fitting and under-fitting in the profiling phase. In this paper, we mathematically prove the relationship among different stochastic models, and propose a new method named ECM to solve the problem that much time is required to solve matrix in the profiling phase. Replacing the observations in the matrix solution with the average signals, the new method accelerates the construction of any stochastic model significantly, as long as the data-dependent signal has the property equal images under different subkeys. On the basis of theoretical results, we analyze the reasons why over-fitting and under-fitting happen, and quantify the condition when some of them occur. Finally, comparing with the existing construction method (HSS2012), we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of ECM with different metrics. Under the same accuracy, the ECM obviously has lower time complexity than HSS2012.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Cloud storage platforms promise a convenient way for users to share files and engage in collaborations, yet they require all files to have a single owner who unilaterally makes access control decisions. Existing clouds are, thus, agnostic to the notion of shared ownership. This can be a significant limitation in much collaboration because, for example, one owner can delete files and revoke access without consulting the other collaborators. In this paper, we first formally define a notion of shared ownership within a file access control model. We then propose two possible instantiations of our proposed shared ownership model. Our first solution, called Commune, relies on secure file dispersal and collusion-resistant secret sharing to ensure that all access grants in the cloud require the support of an agreed threshold of owners. As such, Commune can be used in existing clouds without modifications to the platforms. Our second solution, dubbed Comrade, leverages the blockchain technology in order to reach consensus on access control decision. Unlike Commune, Comrade requires that the cloud is able to translate access control decisions that reach consensus in the blockchain into storage access control rules, thus requiring minor modifications to existing clouds. We analyze the security of our proposals and compare/evaluate their performance through implementations using Amazon S3.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Accurate channel state information (CSI) is a key requirement for massive multiple-input multiple-output to achieve multi-fold increases in throughput and secrecy rate. Consequently, an adversary targeting the channel sounding process has the potential to significantly degrade performance. In this paper, we first present and model the pilot distortion attack, a simple but devastating jamming strategy in which the adversary distorts the access point&#x2019;s (AP&#x2019;s) CSI measurement of even a single client leading to denial of service for all clients associated with the AP. We then propose multiple-antenna carrier frequency offset estimate (MACE) as a countermeasure that exploits the AP&#x2019;s antenna array to detect jamming with zero startup cost and zero additional network overhead. Our key insight is that with multiple antennas, the AP&#x2019;s variance estimator of client carrier frequency offset significantly increases when there are jamming signals present. We build a test bed with a 72-antenna AP and collect over 3 000 000 over-the-air transmissions. Our results show that a single-antenna adversary jamming no more than 1/60 of the time and having no more transmit power than any client can cause over 23&#x0025; reduction of achievable rate of all clients. Moreover, by setting a single detection threshold, MACE can achieve 0.97 true positive at 0.01 false positive for various client/adversary locations and for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (5 &#x007e; 35 dB) and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) (&#x2212;5 &#x007e; 35 dB) with SNR &#x2013; SIR  $geq5$  dB.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recently, there has been great interest in feature-based image source identification. Previous statistical learning-based methods usually regarded the identification process as a classification problem. They assumed the dependence of features and the dependence of models. However, the two assumptions are usually problematic because of the genuine coupling of features and models. To address the issues, in this paper, we propose a novel image source identification scheme. For the feature coupling, a coupled feature representation is adopted to analyze the coupled interaction among features. The coupling relations among features and their powers are measured with Pearson&#x2019;s correlations and integrated in a Taylor-like expansion manner. Regarding model coupling, a new coupled probability representation is developed. The model coupling relationships are characterized with conditional probabilities induced by the confusion matrix and then combined with the law of total probability. The experiments carried out on the Dresden image collection confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Via mining the feature coupling and model coupling, the identification accuracy can be significantly improved.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a frequency-weighted impedance method for the characterization of piezoelectric bending beam energy harvesters. The method uses the frequency response of the beam to determine the beam model parameters. Existing methods often need to measure the beam tip deflection for the characterization of the parameters. This requires the accessibility of the tip and advanced measurement tools, such as a laser vibrometer. However, in the proposed method only the knowledge of the base acceleration is adequate to determine the electromechanical coupling coefficient of the beam. Furthermore, the rest of parameters including mechanical damping ratio can be determined based on a pure electrical test. The proposed method is useful for the characterization of all types of piezoelectric energy harvesters, particularly the vacuum-packed ones in which the tip of the beam is inaccessible. The validity of the method is experimentally verified using a test setup including a vacuum-packed piezoelectric energy harvester. The measured parameters of the beam are compared with the bulk material parameters showing that the proposed method can accurately estimate the model parameters without using the information of the tip deflection and with an error less than 4&#x0025;.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, an energy saving variable damping seat suspension system is designed, manufactured, modeled, and validated. A continuously controllable electromagnetic damper (EMD) system, which consists of a permanent magnet synchronous motor, a three-phase rectifier, a metal&#x2013;oxide&#x2013;semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) switch, and an external resistor, is built and tested first. Its model parameters have been identified based on the test results. The EMD&#x0027;s damping property can be controlled by exerting pulsewidth modulation (PWM) signal with different duty cycles on the MOSFET switch. The EMD is integrated with a planetary gearbox to amplify its torque output, and the formed variable damper is installed on the center of the scissors structure of a seat suspension. By analyzing the EMD test results and the seat suspension&#x0027;s kinematic, the controllable damping of the proposed seat suspension is derived as 112 to 746&#x00a0;N&#x00b7;s/m. A control method for vibration isolation is proposed based on the system model. The proposed variable damping seat suspension and its controller are validated on a six-degrees-of-freedom vibration platform in both frequency domain and time domain; a well-tuned commercial passive seat suspension is also tested for comparison. The test results show that the controlled variable damping seat suspension has better performance in vibration isolation than the proposed seat with highest and lowest damping, and the conventional passive one. In the meantime, the RMS value of the system harvestable power is 1.492&#x00a0;W, and the power consumption of the PWM control signal is small. Therefore, this variable damping seat suspension can improve ride comfort with ignorable energy cost.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel nonisolated single-input dual-output three-level dc&#x2013;dc converter (SIDO-TLC) appropriate for medium- and high-voltage applications. The SIDO-TLC is an integration of the three-level buck and boost converters, whose output voltages are regulated simultaneously. Reducing voltage stress across semiconductor devices, improving efficiency, and reducing inductors size are among the main merits of the new topology. Moreover, due to the considerably reduced volume of the step-down filter capacitor, a small film capacitor can be used instead, whose advantages are lower equivalent series resistance and a longer lifespan. A closed-loop control system has been designed based on a small-signal model derivation in order to regulate the output voltages along with the capacitors&#x2019; voltage balancing. In order to verify the theoretical and simulation results, a 300-W prototype was built and experimented. The results prove the aforementioned advantages of the SIDO-TLC, and the high effectiveness of the balancing control strategy. Furthermore, the converter shows very good stability, even under simultaneous step changes of the loads and input voltage.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In order to increase the operation safety of the railway vehicles, including subways, tramways, and all other types of the trains running on the railroads, it is necessary to inspect the status of them frequently. A key parameter in inspection of railway vehicles is the wheel diameter as well as its profile and overall geometry. The diameter of a wheel decreases during operation due to wear. Any difference between diameters of the wheels in a bogie frame or in a car body should be in an allowable range specified by the railway technical standards. It is also vital to utilize a system for continuous checking of the wheel diameter to prevent train derailment. A new measurement system based on the image processing is proposed to perform the diameter measurement in a reliable manner in this paper. Traditional measurement systems are usually based on the mechanical devices and are unreliable and sometimes expensive due to the need for a perfect physical contact and consequent precise mechanical components. The proposed system is based on the modification of three-point radius measurement technique. The appropriate image processing is developed to decrease the steps in conventional third point calculation to gain time saving and fast operation. It is shown that this approach is an efficient technique for high-accuracy wheel diameter measurement. Experimental results show capability of the system for industrial use.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a model-based current control (MBCC) approach with a compensating of dc-side inductor current ripple, active damping, and virtual time constant is proposed for single-phase grid-tied quasi-Z-source inverters with an LCL filter. The idea behind the ripple compensation is based on the inherent relationship between the ripple components of the dc-side inductor and capacitor voltages. It is shown that dc-side inductor current ripple can be compensated if the conventional simple boost control involving proportional-integral (PI) controllers is modified by subtracting the measured dc-side inductor voltage from the error signal of the first PI controller. Also, it is shown that the proposed MBCC causes the ac-side inverter current to track its reference in all circumstances. In addition, a virtual time constant is added to the control variable so that the dynamics of the ac-side inverter current can be adjusted as desired. Finally, in order to damp the LCL resonance, an active damping method is employed in the closed-loop system by modifying the ac-side reference inverter current. Experimental results are presented to show the validity and performance of the proposed control approach.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a recently developed technique to perfectly address the energy problem for smart city sensors that do not have a readily wired power supply. In a radio-frequency-powered wireless communication system, sensors first harvest energy via the radio-frequency WPT, and then, transmit sensed data to the receiver. The &#x201c;harvest-then-transmit&#x201d; protocol is used to coordinate the two operations, in which we wish to optimally decide when to harvest energy, when to transmit data, and what transmission rate should be used such that the data are maximally transmitted. Unlike existing works, we assumed that the wireless transferred power is dynamically changing, instead of being constant, which is more realistic in green smart city applications, e.g., Industry 4.0 workshop, smart transportation, and smart buildings, where environments are continuously changing, so the wireless transferred power is affected dynamically. In this paper, we present an optimal scheduling algorithm for the offline case where the varying WPT is known in advance. Based on the optimal principles learned from the offline case, we have designed an efficient online algorithm. Finally, we report our simulation results that demonstrate that our online scheduling algorithm can adaptively and efficiently achieve high data throughput.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Cyber-physical Internet of things system (CPIoTS), as an evolution of Internet of things (IoT), plays a significant role in industrial area to support the interoperability and interaction of various machines (e.g., sensors, actuators, and controllers) by providing seamless connectivity with low bandwidth requirement. The fifth generation (5G) is a key enabling technology to revolutionize the future of industrial CPIoTS. In this paper, a communication framework based on 5G is presented to support the deployment of CPIoTS with a central controller. Based on this framework, multiple sensors and actuators can establish communication links with the central controller in full-duplex mode. To accommodate the signal data in the available channel band, the resource allocation problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonconvex programming problem, aiming to maximize the sum energy efficiency of CPIoTS. By introducing the transformation, we decompose the resource allocation problem into power allocation and channel allocation. Moreover, we consider an energy-efficient power allocation algorithm based on game theory and Dinkelbach&#x0027;s algorithm. Finally, to reduce the computational complexity, the channel allocation is modeled as a three-dimensional matching problem, and solved by iterative Hungarian method with virtual devices (IHM-VD). A comparison is performed with well-known existing algorithms to demonstrate the performance of the proposed one. The simulation results validate the efficiency of our proposed model, which significantly outperforms other benchmark algorithms in terms of meeting the energy efficiency and the QoS requirements.

We analyze the performance of a massive MIMO base station deployed at a data center to provide massive connectivity to a large number of devices. In addition, we discuss related research challenges for deploying massive MIMO in industrial internet applications of CPS, such as device scheduling and power control, energy efficient design and radio frequency energy transfer/harvesting, signaling techniques for drones and mobile robots, and applications of underwater industrial internet.
