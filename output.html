<p>Secure sketch produces public information of its input $w$ without revealing
it, yet, allows the exact recovery of $w$ given another value $w'$ that is
close to $w$. Therefore, it can be used to reliably reproduce any error-prone
secret (i.e., biometrics) stored in secret storage. However, some sources have
lower entropy compared to the error itself, formally called "more error than
entropy", a standard secure sketch cannot show its security promise perfectly
to these kind of sources. This paper focuses on secure sketch. We propose a
concrete construction for secure sketch. We show security to all noisy sources,
including the trivial source with zero min-entropy. In addition, our
construction comes with efficient recovery algorithm operates in polynomial
time in the sketch size, which can tolerate high number of error rate arbitrary
close to 1/2. Above result acts in conjunction to our derivation on the
solution to two NP-complete coding problems, suggesting P=NP.

<p>Over the last decade there has been a continuing decline in social trust on
the part of individuals with regards to the handling and fair use of personal
data, digital assets and other related rights in general. At the same time,
there has been a change in the employment patterns for many people through the
emergence of the gig economy. These gig workers include artists, songwriters
and musicians in the music industry. We discuss the notion of the data
cooperative with fiduciary responsibilities to its members, which is similar in
purpose to credit unions in the financial sector. A data cooperative for
artists and musicians allows the community to share IT resources, such as data
storage, analytics processing, blockchains and distributed ledgers. A
cooperative can also employ smart contracts to remedy the various challenges
currently faced by the music industry with regards to the license tracking
management.

<p>Users trust IoT apps to control and automate their smart devices. These apps
necessarily have access to sensitive data to implement their functionality.
However, users lack visibility into how their sensitive data is used (or
leaked), and they often blindly trust the app developers. In this paper, we
present IoTWatcH, a novel dynamic analysis tool that uncovers the privacy risks
of IoT apps in real-time. We designed and built IoTWatcH based on an IoT
privacy survey that considers the privacy needs of IoT users. IoTWatcH provides
users with a simple interface to specify their privacy preferences with an IoT
app. Then, in runtime, it analyzes both the data that is sent out of the IoT
app and its recipients using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
Moreover, IoTWatcH informs the users with its findings to make them aware of
the privacy risks with the IoT app. We implemented IoTWatcH on real IoT
applications. Specifically, we analyzed 540 IoT apps to train the NLP model and
evaluate its effectiveness. IoTWatcH successfully classifies IoT app data sent
to external parties to correct privacy labels with an average accuracy of
94.25%, and flags IoT apps that leak privacy data to unauthorized parties.
Finally, IoTWatcH yields minimal overhead to an IoT app's execution, on average
105 ms additional latency.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Secure distance measurement and therefore secure Time-of-Arrival (ToA)
measurement is critical for applications such as contactless payments,
passive-keyless entry and start systems, and navigation systems. This paper
initiates the study of Message Time of Arrival Codes (MTACs) and their
security. MTACs represent a core primitive in the construction of systems for
secure ToA measurement. By surfacing MTACs in this way, we are able for the
first time to formally define the security requirements of physical-layer
measures that protect ToA measurement systems against attacks. Our viewpoint
also enables us to provide a unified presentation of existing MTACs (such as
those proposed in distance-bounding protocols and in a secure distance
measurement standard) and to propose basic principles for protecting ToA
measurement systems against attacks that remain unaddressed by existing
mechanisms. We also use our perspective to systematically explore the tradeoffs
between security and performance that apply to all signal modulation techniques
enabling ToA measurements.

<p>In this paper, we present a novel method of differentiating known from
previously unseen malware families. We utilize transfer learning by learning
compact file representations that are used for a new classification task
between previously seen malware families and novel ones. The learned file
representations are composed of static and dynamic features of malware and are
invariant to small modifications that do not change their malicious
functionality. Using an extensive dataset that consists of thousands of
variants of malicious files, we were able to achieve 97.7% accuracy when
classifying between seen and unseen malware families. Our method provides an
important focalizing tool for cybersecurity researchers and greatly improves
the overall ability to adapt to the fast-moving pace of the current threat
landscape.

<p>In a report, State of Lung Cancer, released on Nov 12, the American Lung Association shows that 5-year survival for US patients with lung cancer has improved from a dismal 17&#183;2% 10 years ago, to 21&#183;7% now. This improvement is attributed to a combination of personalised, biomarker-driven treatment, screening of people at high risk and, therefore, diagnosis at earlier stages, and advancements in research and drug development. Yet progress is uneven by states and by populations. For example, the incidence is 27&#183;1 per 100&#8200;000 people in Utah compared with 92&#183;6 per 100&#8200;000 in Kentucky.

Airy's article drew on testimony from some of the leading British scientists of the day, and included some of the most striking images in any scientific paper&#8212;jagged, spiralling depictions of auras. Airy presented teichopsia as an entirely new diagnosis, unconnected with the long-established disorder known, variously, as emigranea, megrim, or migraine.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In order to suppress the torque ripple of an open-end winding permanent-magnet synchronous machine (OEW-PMSM), a q-axis current injection method is typically employed but the disturbances caused by the third flux linkage parameter mismatch can augment the torque ripple. To solve this problem, in this paper, first, a zero-sequence current (ZSC) and zero-sequence back-EMF observer (ZCBO) are proposed based on an adaptive sliding mode control, which is able to simultaneously estimate ZSC and zero-sequence back EMF under varying conditions. Based on this ZCBO, the estimated ZSC and zero-sequence back EMF could compensate for the one-step control delay and suppress the aforementioned disturbances. Second, although central hexagon modulation is employed in the predictive current control (PCC) scheme, zero-sequence voltage (ZSV) still exists in the zero-sequence path due to the dead time of the inverter, affecting the predictive accuracy of the ZCBO. To accurately establish the ZCBO, the ZSV caused by the dead time of the inverter is considered in the ZCBO. Finally, a comparative study of two types of methods is presented, and simulations established by MATLAB software and experimental confirmations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed PCC scheme in this paper.

<p>In this paper, the control problem for an underactuated quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a suspended payload is investigated. An energy-based nonlinear controller is proposed that is able to control the quadrotor UAV's position and the payload's swing angle asymptotically. An adaptive control design is developed to compensate for the unknown length of the cable which is used to connect the UAV and the payload. The Lyapunov-based stability analysis is employed together to prove the stability of the closed-loop system. Detailed real-time experimental results illustrate the good performance of the proposed controller.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Accurate information of battery internal variables is crucial for health-conscious and optimal battery management. Due to lack of measurements, advanced battery management systems rely heavily on estimation algorithms that provide such internal information. Although algorithms for cell-level charge and health estimation have been widely explored in the literature, algorithms for electrode-level quantities are almost nonexistent. The main obstacle in electrode-level estimation is the observability problem where the individual electrode states are not observable from terminal voltage output. However, if available, real-time feedback of electrode-level charge and health can be highly beneficial in maximizing energy utilization and battery life. Motivated by this scenario, in this paper we propose a real-time algorithm that estimates the available charge and health of individual electrodes. We circumvent the aforementioned observability problem by proposing an uncertain model-based cascaded estimation framework. The design and analysis of the proposed scheme are aided by a combination of Lyapunov's stability theory, adaptive observer theory, and interconnected systems theory. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the estimation scheme by performing extensive simulation and experimental studies.

<p>This paper presents a method that combines a robust controller (H<sub>&#x221e;</sub>) and an iterative learning controller (ILC) to control a low mechanical bandwidth nanopositioning stage for high-speed atomic force microscopy imaging. In conventional scanning configurations, the imaging speed of a low-resonance frequency scanner is limited to a few Hz. However, the images obtained using the proposed method have no obvious anamorphosis with a scan speed of up to 80 Hz. This method uses a sinusoidal scanning mode in the fast-scan axis, which effectively reduces the mechanical vibration of the XY-scanner and improves the imaging bandwidth. In addition, a compact high-bandwidth Z-scanner configured with a symmetrical dual-actuator was developed to replace the Z-axis of the nanopositioning stage for high-speed tracking of the sample topography. To further improve the imaging performance, an ILC is designed to suppress the nonlinear behavior of piezoelectric and reduce the tracking error. In addition, a model-based H<sub>&#x221e;</sub> is designed to reduce the measurement error and enhance the image quality. All algorithms and real-time control are implemented with a field-programmable gate array platform. The experimental results demonstrated that these configurations exhibit significant performance improvements by comparison with conventional scanning modes.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are capable of modeling temporal dependencies of complex sequential data. In general, current available structures of RNNs tend to concentrate on controlling the contributions of current and previous information. However, the exploration of different importance levels of different elements within an input vector is always ignored. We propose a simple yet effective Element-wise-Attention Gate (EleAttG), which can be easily added to an RNN block (e.g. all RNN neurons in an RNN layer), to empower the RNN neurons to have attentiveness capability. For an RNN block, an EleAttG is used for adaptively modulating the input by assigning different levels of importance, i.e., attention, to each element/dimension of the input. We refer to an RNN block equipped with an EleAttG as an EleAtt-RNN block. Instead of modulating the input as a whole, the EleAttG modulates the input at fine granularity, i.e., element-wise, and the modulation is content adaptive. The proposed EleAttG, as an additional fundamental unit, is general and can be applied to any RNN structures, e.g., standard RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EleAtt-RNN by applying it to different tasks including the action recognition, from both skeleton-based data and RGB videos, gesture recognition, and sequential MNIST classification. Experiments show that adding attentiveness through EleAttGs to RNN blocks significantly improves the power of RNNs.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The human visual system tends to consider saliency of an object as a whole. Some object-level saliency detection methods have been proposed by leveraging object proposals in bounding boxes, and regarding the entire bounding box as one candidate salient region. However, the bounding boxes can not provide exact object position and a lot of pixels in bounding boxes belong to the background. Consequently, background pixels in bounding box also show high saliency. Besides, acquiring object proposals needs high time cost. In order to compute object-level saliency, we consider region growing from some seed superpixels, to find one surrounding region which probably represents the whole object. The desired surrounding region has similar appearance inside and obvious difference with the outside, which is proposed as maximally stable region (MSR) in this paper. In addition, one effective seed superpixel selection strategy is presented to improve speed. MSR based saliency detection is more robust than pixel or superpixel level methods and object proposal based methods. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods at 50 FPS. Compared with deep learning based methods, we show worse performance, but with about 1200-1600 times faster, which means better trade-off between performance and speed.

<p>In this paper, we develop a concise but efficient network architecture called linear compressing based skip-connecting network (LCSCNet) for image super-resolution. Compared with two representative network architectures with skip connections, ResNet and DenseNet, a linear compressing layer is designed in LCSCNet for skip connection, which connects former feature maps and distinguishes them from newly-explored feature maps. In this way, the proposed LCSCNet enjoys the merits of the distinguish feature treatment of DenseNet and the parameter-economic form of ResNet. Moreover, to better exploit hierarchical information from both low and high levels of various receptive fields in deep models, inspired by gate units in LSTM, we also propose an adaptive element-wise fusion strategy with multi-supervised training. Experimental results in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms validate the effectiveness of LCSCNet.

In this paper, we propose a novel event-driven method aiming at satisfying a required level of control accuracy and saving energy consumption of the actuators, while guaranteeing a bounded action delay. We formulate a joint-design problem of both actuator scheduling and output control. To solve this problem, we propose a two-step optimization method. In the first step, the problem of actuator scheduling and action time allocation is decomposed into two subproblems. They are solved iteratively by utilizing the solution of one in the other. The convergence of this iterative algorithm is proved. In the second step, an online method is proposed to estimate the error and adjust the outputs of the actuators accordingly. Through simulations and experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The development of the cutting-edge technologies in cogeneration and trigeneration has led to a rapid transition toward integrated energy systems and the mushrooming of energy hubs, calling for effective energy management schemes. This paper proposes a distributed algorithm for autonomous energy management (AEM) of a cluster of residential energy hubs. Given the interactive behaviors of energy purchasing at the supply side, we treat each hub as a self-interested agent, and formulate the AEM problem of these hubs as a monotone generalized Nash game (MON-GNG). On one hand, there are global coupling constraints representing the supply limits of the input energy systems, which are imposed by the limited capacities of electrical feeders and natural gas pipelines, thus making it a GNG. On the other hand, the cost function of each hub is merely convex in its actions considering the input-to-output energy transformation inside and the impacts of the energy storage devices, which leads to an MON game. The existence of the generalized Nash equilibria (GNEs) of this MON-GNG can be theoretically guaranteed. Then, by reformulating the MON-GNG as a variational inequality problem with special decomposition structure, an efficient and single-loop distributed algorithm is then proposed for computing a GNE with clear economic interpretation based on an improved Tikhonov regularization technique. Principles of parameter selection that will guarantee convergence are suggested. Numeric simulations validate the convergence performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In a noisy manufacturing environment, range-based target localization for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) experiences various variations in range measurements, thus causing the unsatisfactory results. Starting from an empirical observation on the existing various industrial noise distribution, in this paper, a diffusion Gauss&#x2013;Newton (GN) algorithm with cooperation strategy is proposed for solving target localization non linear-least-squares problem in a WSN. The proposed algorithm has an equalization effect on the unbalance noise distribution over the network by aggregating the global estimates into local GN update via diffusion strategy. When facing a hostile industrial environment where the ambient noise is heterogeneous or has the sudden changes across partial nodes, the significant performance degradation is produced by diffusion GN. To solve the problem, we propose further an improved version of diffusion GN, which is adaptive to sudden changes on noisy range measurements. Instead of using a static combiner, the new algorithm leverages the evolutionary game theory to assign a time-varying weight for the estimate from each neighboring node based on the individual range error. Consequently, the good estimates from the neighbors with high SNR have a larger weight in the combiner than the bad estimates caused by the low SNR or high noise. We also propose a simple but effective energy-accuracy tradeoff scheme by using a sigmoidal utility function. Some simulation examples show that the standard diffusion GN is effective in stationary noise and its improved version provides the adaptation to changing noisy environment. The effectiveness of energy&#x2013;accuracy tradeoff is also validated.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the continuous iteration of information technology, information presents an explosive development trend, so how to effectively classify, retrieve, and summarize information is very important. Data classification and mining technology as the key technology to solve the aforementioned problems is of great significance. At present, in the fields of data processing, information classification and machine learning reinforcement learning, it is usually based on the learning automata, but the traditional learning automata algorithm cannot meet the development of information technology in terms of convergence and learning rate. In order to improve the convergence stability and learning efficiency of the learning automata algorithm in random environment and enhance its learning ability in dealing with large-scale space and action, this paper innovatively proposes an adaptive fuzzy reinforcement learning model of the learning automata, which makes full use of the randomness of gradient information to solve its stability problem, and abandons the original reinforcement learning method. For the linear function, an adaptive fuzzy numerical superposition algorithm is used to further enhance its learning rate and improve its stability. The experimental results show that the proposed learning automata fuzzy reinforcement learning model has practical application value, and can solve the problems of unstable convergence and poor learning efficiency of the current learning automata.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This article proposes a novel nonlinear receding horizon optimal control algorithm for wave energy converter (WECs) with nonlinear dynamics. It is well accepted that the WEC control problem is essentially a noncausal constrained optimal control problem, where the energy output can be improved by incorporating the short-term wave prediction into the control synthesis. Inspired by this fact, we suggest a new nonlinear noncausal optimal control (NNOC) for WECs based on the principle of approximate dynamic programming, which can, first, explicitly use the wave prediction to improve the energy conversion efficiency; second, handle the state and control input constraints; third, reduce the computational burden. Different to the existing linear noncausal optimal control, the derived Hamilton&#x2013;Jacobi&#x2013;Bellman equation for NNOC does not have an analytic solution. To tackle this problem, a critic neural network (NN) is adopted to approximate its solution in a receding horizon manor. The weights of NN are determined via a policy iteration algorithm. The resulting NNOC consists of a causal state feedback part and a noncausal feedforward part to explicit incorporate wave prediction information. Numerical simulations are provided to verify the efficacy of the proposed NNOC method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a sensorless vibration harmonic frequency estimation for a servo system driven by a permanent magnet (PM) synchronous machine. Traditional vibration harmonic estimation relies on the measurement using external sensors. An accelerometer is typically installed in the servo system to measure the vibration harmonic signal. Because the accelerometer must be attached on the visibly vibrational location inside the system, this vibration detection results in both issues about installation and reliability. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes a disturbance observer to estimate the vibration harmonic by using current and position signal. A real-time signal process is developed to identify the vibration frequency from estimated harmonic. A servo system with a 400-W PM machine is built to verify the proposed vibration harmonic and frequency estimation. This paper includes the comparative evaluation between the accelerometer-based vibration harmonic measurement and the sensorless estimation.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used for image recognition, speech recognition, and other pattern analysis tasks. Despite the success of DNNs, these systems can be exploited by what is termed adversarial examples. An adversarial example, in which a small distortion is added to the input data, can be designed to be misclassified by the DNN while remaining undetected by humans or other systems. Such adversarial examples have been studied mainly in the image domain. Recently, however, studies on adversarial examples have been expanding into the voice domain. For example, when an adversarial example is applied to enemy wiretapping devices (victim classifiers) in a military environment, the enemy device will misinterpret the intended message. In such scenarios, it is necessary that friendly wiretapping devices (protected classifiers) should not be deceived. Therefore, the selective adversarial example concept can be useful in mixed situations, defined as situations in which there is both a classifier to be protected and a classifier to be attacked. In this paper, we propose a selective audio adversarial example with minimum distortion that will be misclassified as the target phrase by a victim classifier but correctly classified as the original phrase by a protected classifier. To generate such examples, a transformation is carried out to minimize the probability of incorrect classification by the protected classifier and that of correct classification by the victim classifier. We conducted experiments targeting the state-of-the-art DeepSpeech voice recognition model using Mozilla Common Voice datasets and the Tensorflow library. They showed that the proposed method can generate a selective audio adversarial example with a 91.67% attack success rate and 85.67% protected classifier accuracy.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>People constantly share their photographs with others through various social media sites. With the aid of the privacy settings provided by social media sites, image owners can designate scope of sharing, e.g., close friends and acquaintances. However, even if the owner of a photograph carefully sets the privacy setting to exclude a given individual who is not supposed to see the photograph, the photograph may still eventually reach a wider audience, including those clearly undesired through unanticipated channels of disclosure, causing a privacy breach. Moreover, it is often the case that a given image involves multiple stakeholders who are also depicted in the photograph. Due to various personalities, it is even more challenging to reach agreement on the privacy settings for these multi-owner photographs. In this paper, we propose a privacy risk reminder system, called REMIND, which estimates the probability that a shared photograph may be seen by unwanted people-through the social graph-who are not included in the original sharing list. We tackle this problem from a novel angle by digging into the big data regarding image sharing history. Specifically, the social media providers possess a huge amount of image sharing information (e.g., what photographs are shared with whom) of their users. By analyzing and modeling such rich information, we build a sophisticated probability model that efficiently aggregates the image disclosure probabilities along different possible image propagation chains and loops. If the computed disclosure probability indicates high risks of privacy breach, a reminder is issued to the image owner to help revise the privacy settings (or, at least, inform the user about this accidental disclosure risk). The proposed REMIND system also has a nice feature of policy harmonization that helps resolve privacy differences in multi-owner photographs. We have carried out a user study to validate the rationale of our proposed solutions and also conducte-
 experimental studies to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed REMIND system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The side-channel leakage is a consequence of program execution in a computer processor, and understanding relationship between code execution and information leakage is a necessary step in estimating information leakage and its capacity limits. This paper proposes a methodology to relate program execution to electromagnetic side-channel emanations and estimates side-channel information capacity created by execution of series of instructions (e.g., a function, a procedure, or a program) in a processor. To model dependence among program instructions in a code, we propose to use Markov source model, which includes the dependencies among sequence of instructions as well as dependencies among instructions as they pass through a pipeline of the processor. The emitted electromagnetic (EM) signals during instruction executions are natural choice for the inputs into the model. To obtain the channel inputs for the proposed model, we derive a mathematical relationship between the emanated instruction signal power (ESP) and total emanated signal power while running a program. Then, we derive the leakage capacity of EM side channels created by execution of series of instructions in a processor. Finally, we provide experimental results to demonstrate that leakages could be severe and that a dedicated attacker could obtain important information.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a widely used tool for machine learning in distributed settings where a machine learning model is trained over distributed data sources through an interactive process of local computation and message passing. Such an iterative process could cause privacy concerns of data owners. The goal of this paper is to provide differential privacy for ADMM-based distributed machine learning. Prior approaches on differentially private ADMM exhibit low utility under high privacy guarantee and assume the objective functions of the learning problems to be smooth and strongly convex. To address these concerns, we propose a novel differentially private ADMM-based distributed learning algorithm called DP-ADMM, which combines an approximate augmented Lagrangian function with time-varying Gaussian noise addition in the iterative process to achieve higher utility for general objective functions under the same differential privacy guarantee. We also apply the moments accountant method to analyze the end-to-end privacy loss. The theoretical analysis shows that the DP-ADMM can be applied to a wider class of distributed learning problems, is provably convergent, and offers an explicit utility-privacy tradeoff. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to provide explicit convergence and utility properties for differentially private ADMM-based distributed learning algorithms. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can achieve good convergence and model accuracy under high end-to-end differential privacy guarantee.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The bitonic filter was recently developed to embody the novel concept of signal bitonicity (one local extremum within a set range) to differentiate from noise, by use of data ranking and linear operators. For processing images, the spatial extent was locally constrained to a fixed circular mask. Since structure in natural images varies, a novel structurally varying bitonic filter is presented, which locally adapts the mask, without following patterns in the noise. This new filter includes novel robust structurally varying morphological operations, with efficient implementations, and a novel formulation of non-iterative directional Gaussian filtering. Data thresholds are also integrated with the morphological operations, increasing noise reduction for low noise, and enabling a multi-resolution framework for high noise levels. The structurally varying bitonic filter is presented without presuming prior knowledge of morphological filtering, and compared to high-performance linear noise-reduction filters, to set this novel concept in context. These are tested over a wide range of noise levels, on a fairly broad set of images. The new filter is a considerable improvement on the fixed-mask bitonic, outperforms anisotropic diffusion and image-guided filtering in all but extremely low noise, non-local means at all noise levels, but not the block-matching 3D filter, though results are promising for very high noise. The structurally varying bitonic tends to have less characteristic residual noise in regions of smooth signal, and very good preservation of signal edges, though with some loss of small scale detail when compared to the block-matching 3D filter. The efficient implementation means that processing time, though slower than the fixed-mask bitonic filter, remains competitive.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Seismic image interpolation is a currently popular research subject in modern reflection seismology. The interpolation problem is generally treated as a process of inversion. Under the compressed sensing framework, various sparse transformations and low-rank constraints based methods have great performances in recovering irregularly missing traces. However, in the case of regularly missing traces, their applications are limited because of the strong spatial aliasing energies. In addition, the erratic noise always poses a serious impact on the interpolation results obtained by the sparse transformations and low-rank constraints-based methods,. This is because the erratic noise is far from satisfying the statistical assumption behind these methods. In this study, we propose a mathematical morphology-based interpolation technique, which constrains the morphological scale of the model in the inversion process. The inversion problem is solved by the shaping regularization approach. The mathematical morphological constraint (MMC)-based interpolation technique has a satisfactory robustness to the spatial aliasing and erratic energies. We provide a detailed algorithmic framework and discuss the extension from 2D to higher dimensional version and the back operator in the shaping inversion. A group of numerical examples demonstrates the successful performance of the proposed technique.
