<p>Interpregnancy interval, defined as the time from the end of one pregnancy to the conception of the next, has been studied for nearly a century as a risk factor for adverse outcome (miscarriage, perinatal death, preterm birth, low birthweight, and small-for-gestational-age birth) in the next pregnancy.1,2 There is consistent evidence that pregnancies conceived less than 18&#8211;24 months after a livebirth are at increased risk of adverse outcomes,1 although recent studies, using a novel design that compares women with three or more births (and therefore two or more intervals) to themselves,3&#8211;6 have questioned this conclusion.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, constitutes a substantial public health concern due to its high morbidity and mortality rates among people typically in low-income populations who often do not have access to timely medical diagnosis and treatment. There are also high economic and social costs generated by the disease. Despite successful and sustained vector control policies and screening of blood and organs for donation, more than 6 million people still live with Chagas disease in the Americas, most of them unaware of their infection.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/issue/current">The Lancet</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Over the past decade there has been an increasing reliance on strong opioids to treat acute and chronic pain, which has been associated with a rising epidemic of prescription opioid misuse, abuse, and overdose-related deaths. Deaths from prescription opioids have more than quadrupled in the USA since 1999, and this pattern is now occurring globally. Inappropriate opioid prescribing after surgery, particularly after discharge, is a major cause of this problem. Chronic postsurgical pain, occurring in approximately 10% of patients who have surgery, typically begins as acute postoperative pain that is difficult to control, but soon transitions into a persistent pain condition with neuropathic features that are unresponsive to opioids.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/issue/current">The Lancet</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Opioids are a mainstay of acute pain management but can have many adverse effects, contributing to problematic long-term use. Opioid tolerance (increased dose needed for analgesia) and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (paradoxical increase in pain with opioid administration) can contribute to both poorly controlled pain and dose escalation. Hyperalgesia is particularly problematic as further opioid prescribing is largely futile. The mechanisms of opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia are complex, involving &#956; opioid receptor signalling pathways that offer opportunities for novel analgesic alternatives.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as the most popular classification models in biometrics research. Under the discriminative paradigm of pattern recognition, CNNs are used typically in one of two ways: (1) verification mode (&#x201c; are samples from the same person? &#x201d;), where pairs of images are provided to the network to distinguish between genuine and impostor instances and (2) identification mode (&#x201c; whom is this sample from? &#x201d;), where appropriate feature representations that map images to identities are found. This paper postulates a novel mode for using CNNs in biometric identification, by learning models that answer the question &#x201c; is the query's identity among this set? &#x201d;. The insight is a reminiscence of the classical Mastermind game: by iteratively analyzing the network responses when multiple random samples of k gallery elements are compared to the query, we obtain weakly correlated matching scores that, altogether, provide solid cues to infer the most likely identity. In this setting, identification is regarded as a variable selection and regularization problem, with sparse linear regression techniques being used to infer the matching probability with respect to each gallery identity. As main strength, this strategy is highly robust to outlier matching scores, which are known to be a primary error source in biometric recognition. Our experiments were carried out in full versions of two well-known irises near-infrared (CASIA-IrisV4-Thousand) and periocular visible wavelength (UBIRIS.v2) datasets, and confirm that recognition performance can be solidly boosted-up by the proposed algorithm, when compared with the traditional working modes of CNNs in biometrics.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We present an image captioning framework that generates captions under a given topic. The topic candidates are extracted from the caption corpus. A given image's topics are then selected from these candidates by a CNN-based multi-label classifier. The input to the caption generation model is an image-topic pair, and the output is a caption of the image. For this purpose, a cross-modal embedding method is learned for the images, topics, and captions. In the proposed framework, the topic, caption, and image are organized in a hierarchical structure, which is preserved in the embedding space by using the order-embedding method. The caption embedding is upper bounded by the corresponding image embedding and lower bounded by the topic embedding. The lower bound pushes the images and captions about the same topic closer together in the embedding space. A bidirectional caption-image retrieval task is conducted on the learned embedding space and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the embedding method. To generate a caption for an image, an embedding vector is sampled from the region bounded by the embeddings of the image and the topic, then a language model decodes it to a sentence as the output. The lower bound set by the topic shrinks the output space of the language model, which may help the model to learn to match images and captions better. Experiments on the image captioning task on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets validate the usefulness of this framework by showing that the different given topics can lead to different captions describing specific aspects of the given image and that the quality of generated captions is higher than the control model without a topic as input. In addition, the proposed method is competitive with many state-of-the-art methods in terms of standard evaluation metrics.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>As the problem of three-phase unbalance in a distribution network with distributed generations (DGs) is prominent, a multiobjective dynamic reconfiguration method for three-phase balance is proposed to make reconfiguration more reasonable and effective. Based on three-phase power flow calculation and reconfiguration process analysis of distribution networks with DGs, a new reconfiguration model with comprehensive optimization objectives of minimizing three-phase unbalance factor and number of switching times are established. A network connectivity discrimination method based on the algebraic connectivity of graph theory is adopted to quickly remove infeasible solutions, and a new multiobjective molecular differential evolution algorithm is designed to improve optimization depth and avoid prematurity in the optimization process, which is based on the principle of closer molecules with greater intermolecular repulsion. The multiobjective optimal dynamic reconfiguration of a modified IEEE 34-bus test feeder with DGs is carried out and the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, an output feedback finite-time control method is investigated for stabilizing the perturbed vehicle active suspension system to improve the suspension performance. Since physical suspension systems always exist in the phenomenon of uncertainty or external disturbance, a novel disturbance compensator with finite-time convergence performance is proposed for efficiently compensating the unknown external disturbance. Moreover, the presented compensator is advantageous over the existing ones since it is continuous and can completely remove the matched disturbance. From the viewpoint of practical implementation, continuous control law will not lead to chattering, which is desirable for electrical and mechanical systems. For the nominal suspension system without disturbance, a homogeneous controller with a simple filter is constructed to achieve a finite-time convergence property, where the filter is applied to obtain the unknown velocity signal. Thus, the nominal controller combines a disturbance compensator into an overall continuous control law, which provides two independent parts with a separate design unit and a high flexibility for selecting the control gains. According to the geometric homogeneity and finite-time separation principle, it can be shown that the active suspension is finite-time stabilized. A designed example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented controller for improving the vehicle ride performance.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The quality of SLS products is dramatically degraded by excessive temperature gradients in the thermal profile of the powder bed. Thermal gradients in the presintering temperature, which is defined as powder temperature before laser scans, are inevitable in commercial SLS machines due to various reasons. Such a gradient will propagate to the postsintering temperature, which is defined as the material temperature right after laser scans, if constant laser power is used for sintering. To eliminate thermal gradients in the postsintering temperature, this paper proposes an automatic laser control system to adjust laser power according to the presintering temperature. Infrared cameras are used for presintering temperature measurements, which are used to compute optimal laser power profiles. Two control granularities are implemented: 1) vector-level control eliminates thermal gradients in the postsintering temperature of a single scan line and 2) layer-level control minimizes the difference of postsintering temperature of several areas, each of which consists of a number of scan lines, on the build surface. Experimental results show that variations in the postsintering temperature have been reduced by both implementations (to 60&#x0025; and 20&#x0025; respectively) compared to the presintering temperature.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The two-way communication of information between agents in the smart grid, while making way for better monitoring and control, comes at the cost of elevated communication traffic. Compressive sensing is a technique that exploits sparsity of power consumption data (in the Haar basis) and achieves sub-Nyquist compression. Household power consumption data, however, have varying sparseness due to, for example, multistate appliances. Compressing this data with a fixed ratio can lead to nonoptimal results (less compression or large reconstruction error). In this regard, a dynamic compression scheme that estimates a signal&#x0027;s sparsity and decides the amount of compression is desirable. We demonstrate that this approach, when applied with existing estimators of sparsity, has its limitations in overemphasizing one objective compared to the other. We propose a new measure derived from coefficient of variation and demonstrate that it achieves a better tradeoff between reconstruction performance and compression ratio. In addition, we employ a dynamic spatial compression scheme to account for spatial correlation between data of neighboring nodes and present a framework that incorporates dynamic temporal and spatial compression. We present the results on three publicly available datasets at different sampling rates and outline key findings of the study.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep computation, as an advanced machine learning model, has achieved the state-of-the-art performance for feature learning on big data in industrial Internet of Things (IoT). However, the current deep computation model usually suffers from overfitting due to the lack of public available labeled training samples, limiting its performance for big data feature learning. Motivated by the idea of active learning, an adaptive dropout deep computation model (ADDCM) with crowdsourcing to cloud is proposed for industrial IoT big data feature learning in this paper. First, a distribution function is designed to set the dropout rate for each hidden layer to prevent overfitting for the deep computation model. Furthermore, the outsourcing selection algorithm based on the maximum entropy is employed to choose appropriate samples from the training set to crowdsource on the cloud platform. Finally, an improved supervised learning from multiple experts scheme is presented to aggregate answers given by human workers and to update the parameters of the ADDCM simultaneously. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the presented model by comparing with the dropout deep computation model and other state-of-the-art crowdsourcing algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can prevent overfitting effectively and aggregate the labeled samples to train the parameters of the deep computation model with crowdsouring for industrial IoT big data feature learning.

<p>This paper proposes two coupled-inductors-based Z-source networks, called the modified series and tapped switched-coupled-inductors quasi-Z-source networks (mSSCL-qZSN and mTSCL-qZSN, respectively). These networks offer high voltage gains with less-than-unity winding turn ratios $(n &lt; {text{1)}}$, resulting in a reduced inductive element size. Other advantages include a less number of active components and their lower ratings and a higher efficiency. In addition, a lower magnetic core size is required for the proposed ZSNs due to the lower peak magnetizing current. The performance principles and detailed comparative analysis are provided and confirmed through experiments on a 200-W dc&#x2013;dc converter.

<p>This paper provides robust $mathcal {H}_{infty }$ state feedback controllers suitable for implementation in three-phase grid-connected converters. This control strategy is known to provide optimal rejection of disturbances, but usually leads to high control gains, that may be difficult to be implemented in practice. To mitigate this problem, a linear matrix inequality condition based on slack variables is proposed, which allows to impose bounds on the control gains in a less conservative way than conventional quadratic stability. The performance is proven to be superior to similar $mathcal {H}_{infty }$ state feedback controllers in the literature, providing an upper bound for the converter output admittance and experimental grid currents complying with the IEEE Standard 1547.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Cogging torque, inherent in permanent magnet machines, is closely related to the airgap flux density harmonic contents. The third harmonic can be utilized in combination with the fundamental one to increase the average torque, whilst its relationship with cogging torque is uncertain. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of third harmonic in airgap flux density on cogging torque in surface-mounted permanent magnet (SPM) machines considering different slot&#x002f;pole (S&#x002f;P) combinations. First, based on the simplified expressions of cogging torque in machines with sinusoidal plus third harmonic (Sine&#x002b;3rd) airgap flux density, S&#x002f;P combinations are classified into four cases for discussion. It is found that when N<sub>s</sub> &#x002f;GCD (N<sub>s</sub>, N<sub>p</sub>) &#x2265; 4 (N<sub>s</sub>: slot number; N<sub>p</sub>: pole number; GCD: great common divisor), third harmonic in airgap flux density has no effect on cogging torque. Otherwise, cogging torque will be generated. Furthermore, two approaches for obtaining the Sine and Sine&#x002b;3rd airgap flux density, i.e., Sine&#x002f;Sine&#x002b;3rd h<sub>m</sub> and Sine&#x002f;Sine&#x002b;3rd B<sub>r</sub>, are validated, based on which finite-element analyses are carried out on four machines, i.e., 12-slot&#x002f;10-pole (12S12P), 12S6P, 12S8P, and 12S10P to verify the conclusion. Finally, the 12S8P and 12S10P Sine&#x002b;3rd SPM machines are prototyped and tested for validation.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, the fixed-time leader-following consensus problem is investigated for high-order multivariable multiagent systems with external disturbances. A new distributed observer is proposed for each follower under a directed information flow to estimate the leader state in a fixed time. Based on the observer, a novel tracking controller is designed such that the estimated leader state is tracked with disturbance rejection in a fixed time. Consensus conditions are established to guarantee the fixed-time stability. Different from some existing finite-/fixed-time consensus approaches, an explicit estimate for the upper bound of the settling time is derived, which provides additional system specification in advance. Moreover, for disturbance rejection, the chattering phenomenon is effectively reduced by using a distributed multivariable signum function. Finally, illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the theoretical results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Time delays exist in network-connected systems. Especially for vision-based multirobot systems, time delays are diverse and complicated due to the communication network, camera latency, image processing, etc. At the same time, many tasks, such as searching and rescue, have timing requirement. This paper focuses on fixed-time formation control of multirobot systems subject to delay constraints. First, predictor-based state transformation is employed for each robot to deal with the input delay, and the uncertain terms remained in the transformed systems are carefully considered. Then, a couple of nonlinear fixed-time formation protocols are proposed for the multirobot systems with respectively undirected and directed topology, and the corresponding settling time is derived by using the Lyapunov functions. In particular, the upper-bound estimation of the formation settling time is explicitly given irrelevant to the initial conditions. Finally, the protocols are validated through a numerical simulation example and then implemented on an E-puck robots platform. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation protocols.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Digital reconstruction of mechanically shredded documents has received increasing attention in the last years mainly for historical and forensics needs. Computational methods to solve this problem are highly desirable in order to mitigate the time-consuming human effort and to preserve document integrity. The reconstruction of strips-shredded documents is accomplished by horizontally splicing pieces so that the arising sequence (solution) is as similar as the original document. In this context, a central issue is the quantification of the fitting between the pieces (strips), which generally involves stating a function that associates a pair of strips to a real value indicating the fitting quality. This problem is also more challenging for text documents, such as business letters or legal documents, since they depict poor color information. The system proposed here addresses this issue by exploring character shapes as visual features for compatibility computation. Experiments conducted with real mechanically shredded documents showed that our approach outperformed in accuracy other popular techniques in the literature considering documents with (almost) only textual content.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Efficient security patch distribution is of essential importance for updating anti-virus software to ensure effective and timely virus detection and cleanup. In this paper, we propose a mixed strategy of patch distribution to combine the advantages of the traditional centralized patch distribution strategy and decentralized patch distribution strategy. A novel network model that contains a central node and a multiplex network composed of patch dissemination network layer and virus propagation network layer is presented, and a competing spreading dynamical process on top of the network model that simulates the interplay between virus propagation and patch dissemination is developed. Such a new framework helps in effectively analyzing the impacts of patches distribution on virus propagation, and developing more realizable schemes for restraining virus propagation. Furthermore, considering the constraints of the capacity of the central node and the bandwidth of network links, an optimal allocation approach of patches is proposed, which could simultaneously optimize multiple dynamical parameters to effectively restrain the virus propagation with a given budget.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The connected vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) and cloud computing technology allows entities in VANET to enjoy the advantageous storage and computing services offered by some cloud service provider. However, the advantages do not come free, since their combination brings many new security and privacy requirements for VANET applications. In this paper, we investigate the cloud-based road condition monitoring (RCoM) scenario, where the authority needs to monitor real-time road conditions with the help of a cloud server so that it could make sound responses to emergency cases timely. When some bad road condition is detected, e.g., some geologic hazard or accident happens, vehicles on site are able to report such information to a cloud server engaged by the authority. We focus on addressing three key issues in RCoM. First, the vehicles have to be authorized by some roadside unit before generating a road condition report in the domain and uploading it to the cloud server. Second, to guarantee the privacy against the cloud server, the road condition information should be reported in ciphertext format, which requires that the cloud server should be able to distinguish the reported data from different vehicles in ciphertext format for the same place without compromising their confidentiality. Third, the cloud server and authority should be able to validate the report source, i.e., to check whether the road conditions are reported by legitimate vehicles. To address these issues, we present an efficient RCoM scheme, analyze its efficiency theoretically, and demonstrate the practicality through experiments.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The task of Heterogeneous Face Recognition consists in matching face images that are sensed in different domains, such as sketches to photographs (visual spectra images), and thermal images to photographs or near-infrared images to photographs. In this paper, we suggest that the high-level features of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks trained in visual spectra images are potentially domain independent and can be used to encode faces sensed in different image domains. A generic framework for Heterogeneous Face Recognition is proposed by adapting Deep Convolutional Neural Networks low-level features in, so-called, Domain Specific Units. The adaptation using the Domain Specific Units allows the learning of shallow feature detectors specific for each new image domain. Furthermore, it handles its transformation to a generic face space shared between all image domains. Experiments carried out with four different face databases covering three different image domains show substantial improvements, in terms of recognition rate, surpassing the state-of-the-art for most of them. This work is made reproducible: all the source code, scores, and trained models of this approach are made publicly available.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent advancements in deep learning have shown an exciting promise in the urban street scene segmentation. However, many objects, such as poles and sign symbols, are relatively small, and they usually cannot be accurately segmented, since the larger objects usually contribute more to the segmentation loss. In this paper, we propose a new boundary-based metric that measures the level of spatial adjacency between each pair of object classes and find that this metric is robust against object size-induced biases. We develop a new method to enforce this metric into the segmentation loss. We propose a network, which starts with a segmentation network, followed by a new encoder to compute the proposed boundary-based metric, and then trains this network in an end-to-end fashion. In deployment, we only use the trained segmentation network, without the encoder, to segment new unseen images. Experimentally, we evaluate the proposed method using CamVid and CityScapes data sets and achieve a favorable overall performance improvement and a substantial improvement in segmenting small objects.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Automatically identifying the locations and severities of video artifacts without the advantage of an original reference video is a difficult task. We present a novel approach to conducting no-reference artifact detection in digital videos, implemented as an efficient and unique dual-path (parallel) excitatory/inhibitory neural network that uses a simple discrimination rule to define a bank of accurate distortion detectors. The learning engine is distortion-sensitized by pre-processing each video using a statistical image model. The overall system is able to produce full-resolution space&#x2013;time distortion maps for visualization, providing global distortion detection decisions that represent the state of the art in performance. Our model, which we call the video impairment mapper (VIDMAP), produces a first-of-a-kind full-resolution map of artifact detection probabilities. The current realization of this system is able to accurately detect and map eight of the most important artifact categories encountered during streaming video source inspection: aliasing, video encoding corruptions, quantization, contours/banding, combing, compression, dropped frames, and upscaling artifacts. We show that it is either competitive with or significantly outperforms the previous state of the art on the whole-image artifact detection task. A software release of VIDMAP that has been trained to detect and map these artifacts is available online: http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/quality/VIDMAP_release.zip for public use and evaluation.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fractional-pel accurate motion is widely used in video coding. For subband coding, fractional-pel accuracy is challenging since it is difficult to handle the complex motion field with temporal transforms. In our previous work, we designed integer accurate motion-adaptive transforms (MAT) which can transform integer accurate motion-connected coefficients. In this paper, we extend the integer MAT to fractional-pel accuracy. The integer MAT allows only one reference coefficient to be the lowband coefficient. In this paper, we design the transform such that it permits multiple references and generates multiple lowband coefficients. In addition, our fractional-pel MAT can incorporate a general interpolation filter into the basis vector, such that the highband coefficient produced by the transform is the same as the prediction error from the interpolation filter. The fractional-pel MAT is always orthonormal. Thus, the energy is preserved by the transform. We compare the proposed fractional-pel MAT, the integer MAT, and the half-pel motion-compensated orthogonal transform (MCOT), while HEVC intra coding is used to encode the temporal subbands. The experimental results show that the proposed fractional-pel MAT outperforms the integer MAT and the half-pel MCOT. The gain achieved by the proposed MAT over the integer MAT can reach up to 1 dB in PSNR.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Learning similarity of two images is an important problem in computer vision and has many potential applications. Most of the previous works focus on generating image similarities in three aspects: global feature distance computing, local feature matching, and image concepts comparison. However, the task of directly detecting the class agnostic common objects from two images has not been studied before, which goes one step further to capture image similarities at the region level. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end image Common Object Detection Network (CODN) to detect class agnostic common objects from two images. The proposed method consists of two main modules: locating module and matching module. The locating module generates candidate proposals of each two images. The matching module learns the similarities of the candidate proposal pairs from two images, and refines the bounding boxes of the candidate proposals. The learning procedure of CODN is implemented in an integrated way and a multi-task loss is designed to guarantee both region localization and common object matching. Experiments are conducted on PASCAL VOC 2007 and COCO 2014 datasets. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
