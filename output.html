<p>Differential privacy is an information theoretic constraint on algorithms and
code. It provides quantification of privacy leakage and formal privacy
guarantees that are currently considered the gold standard in privacy
protections. In this paper we provide an initial set of ``best practices'' for
developing differentially private platforms, techniques for unit testing that
are specific to differential privacy, guidelines for checking if differential
privacy is being applied correctly in an application, and recommendations for
parameter settings. The genesis of this paper was an initiative by Facebook and
Social Science One to provide social science researchers with programmatic
access to a URL-shares dataset. In order to maximize the utility of the data
for research while protecting privacy, researchers should access the data
through an interactive platform that supports differential privacy.
</p>
<p>The intention of this paper is to provide guidelines and recommendations that
can generally be re-used in a wide variety of systems. For this reason, no
specific platforms will be named, except for systems whose details and theory
appear in academic papers.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fine-tuning through knowledge transfer from a pre-trained model on a
large-scale dataset is a widely spread approach to effectively build models on
small-scale datasets. However, recent literature has shown that such a
fine-tuning approach is vulnerable to adversarial examples based on the
pre-trained model, which raises security concerns for many industrial
applications. In contrast, models trained with random initialization are much
more robust to such attacks, although these models often exhibit much lower
accuracy. In this work, we propose noisy feature distillation, a new transfer
learning method that trains a network from random initialization while
achieving clean-data performance competitive with fine-tuning. In addition, the
method is shown empirically to significantly improve the robustness compared to
fine-tuning with 15x reduction in attack success rate for ResNet-50, from 66%
to 4.4% averaged across Stanford 120 Dogs, Caltech-UCSD 200 Birds, Stanford 40
Actions, MIT 67 Indoor Scenes, and Oxford 102 Flowers datasets. Code is

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Machine learning algorithms are known to be susceptible to data poisoning
attacks, where an adversary manipulates the training data to degrade
performance of the resulting classifier. While many heuristic defenses have
been proposed, few defenses exist which are certified against worst-case
corruption of the training data. In this work, we propose a strategy to build
linear classifiers that are certifiably robust against a strong variant of
label-flipping, where each test example is targeted independently. In other
words, for each test point, our classifier makes a prediction and includes a
certification that its prediction would be the same had some number of training
labels been changed adversarially. Our approach leverages randomized smoothing,
a technique that has previously been used to guarantee---with high
probability---test-time robustness to adversarial manipulation of the input to
a classifier. We derive a variant which provides a deterministic, analytical
bound, sidestepping the probabilistic certificates that traditionally result
from the sampling subprocedure. Further, we obtain these certified bounds with
no additional runtime cost over standard classification. We generalize our
results to the multi-class case, providing what we believe to be the first
multi-class classification algorithm that is certifiably robust to
label-flipping attacks.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Contemporary fuzz testing techniques focus on identifying memory corruption
vulnerabilities that allow adversaries to achieve either remote code execution
or information disclosure. Meanwhile, Algorithmic Complexity
(AC)vulnerabilities, which are a common attack vector for denial-of-service
attacks, remain an understudied threat. In this paper, we present HotFuzz, a
framework for automatically discovering AC vulnerabilities in Java libraries.
HotFuzz uses micro-fuzzing, a genetic algorithm that evolves arbitrary Java
objects in order to trigger the worst-case performance for a method under test.
We define Small Recursive Instantiation (SRI) as a technique to derive seed
inputs represented as Java objects to micro-fuzzing. After micro-fuzzing,
HotFuzz synthesizes test cases that triggered AC vulnerabilities into Java
programs and monitors their execution in order to reproduce vulnerabilities
outside the fuzzing framework. HotFuzz outputs those programs that exhibit high
CPU utilization as witnesses for AC vulnerabilities in a Java library. We
evaluate HotFuzz over the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the 100 most popular
Java libraries on Maven, and challenges contained in the DARPA Space and Time
Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program. We evaluate SRI's effectiveness by
comparing the performance of micro-fuzzing with SRI, measured by the number of
AC vulnerabilities detected, to simply using empty values as seed inputs. In
this evaluation, we verified known AC vulnerabilities, discovered previously
unknown AC vulnerabilities that we responsibly reported to vendors, and
received confirmation from both IBM and Oracle. Our results demonstrate that
micro-fuzzing finds AC vulnerabilities in real-world software, and that
micro-fuzzing with SRI-derived seed inputs outperforms using empty values.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<p>Mobile banking apps, belonging to the most security-critical app category,
render massive and dynamic transactions susceptible to security risks. Given
huge potential financial loss caused by vulnerabilities, existing research
lacks a comprehensive empirical study on the security risks of global banking
apps to provide useful insights and improve the security of banking apps.
</p>
<p>Since data-related weaknesses in banking apps are critical and may directly
cause serious financial loss, this paper first revisits the state-of-the-art
available tools and finds that they have limited capability in identifying
data-related security weaknesses of banking apps. To complement the capability
of existing tools in data-related weakness detection, we propose a three-phase
automated security risk assessment system, named AUSERA, which leverages static
program analysis techniques and sensitive keyword identification. By leveraging
AUSERA, we collect 2,157 weaknesses in 693 real-world banking apps across 83
countries, which we use as a basis to conduct a comprehensive empirical study
from different aspects, such as global distribution and weakness evolution
during version updates. We find that apps owned by subsidiary banks are always
less secure than or equivalent to those owned by parent banks. In addition, we
also track the patching of weaknesses and receive much positive feedback from
banking entities so as to improve the security of banking apps in practice. To
date, we highlight that 21 banks have confirmed the weaknesses we reported. We
also exchange insights with 7 banks, such as HSBC in UK and OCBC in Singapore,
via in-person or online meetings to help them improve their apps. We hope that
the insights developed in this paper will inform the communities about the gaps
among multiple stakeholders, including banks, academic researchers, and
third-party security companies.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Three-phase input diode rectifier interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drives with small-volume film capacitors have many merits, such as high reliability, high power density, and low cost. However, in regenerative braking mode, the dc link may suffer from overvoltage due to the application of slim film capacitors. In this paper, a novel antiovervoltage strategy is proposed by controlling the motor voltage using stator current vector orientation. The relationship among the braking torque, the dc-link capacitance, and the antiovervoltage ability is analyzed quantitatively. Based on the analysis of principle, a closed-loop antiovervoltage regulation scheme is presented, which is easy for applications. Additionally, this method has the merit of low motor parameter dependence. Meanwhile, the small signal model of the electrolytic capacitorless IPMSM drive is derived for the coefficient design of the voltage controller. The proposed algorithm is finally implemented on a 2.2-kW electrolytic capacitorless IPMSM drive platform to verify the effectiveness of the antiovervoltage control scheme.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In most multiobjective optimization problems of electrical machines, the weighted function method is used to convert them into single-objective optimization problems. This paper applies a kind of new multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), called adaptive multiobjective black hole (AMOBH) algorithms, to achieve effective multiobjective optimization of a tubular coreless linear permanent magnet synchronous motor (LPMSM). To reduce the computation cost of the MOEAs, a one-layer analytical model (AM) is presented for the tubular coreless LPMSM in this paper. The accuracy of the simplified one-layer AM is verified by comparisons with multilayer AM and finite element analysis (FEA) under different structure parameters. It is found that the simplified AM has good accuracy and can decrease the computation cost significantly. AMOBH algorithm is subsequently introduced. The optimal Pareto front with regard to thrust, copper loss, and permanent magnet volume are analyzed, and more diversified optimization results are provided. The final Pareto solution can be selected directly by practical physical values according to the application requirements. Finally, a prototype is fabricated for the selected design; its experimental results are provided and compared with those of the FEA results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper addresses the development and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) testing of an explicit nonlinear model predictive controller (eNMPC) for an antilock braking system (ABS) for passenger cars, actuated using an electro-hydraulic braking unit. The control structure includes a compensation strategy to guard against the performance degradation due to actuation dead times, identified by experimental tests. The eNMPC is run on an automotive rapid control prototyping unit, which shows its real-time capability with comfortable margin. A validated high-fidelity vehicle simulation model is used for the assessment of the ABS on a HiL rig equipped with the braking system hardware. The eNMPC is tested in seven emergency braking scenarios, and its performance is benchmarked against a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. The eNMPC results show: 1) the control system robustness with respect to the variations in tire-road friction condition and initial vehicle speed; and 2) consistent and significant improvement of the stopping distance and wheel slip reference tracking, with respect to the vehicle with the PID ABS.

<p>In this paper, an optical calibration instrument is proposed for mass production of irradiation angle sensors. A Lambert-based current compensation principle with nonlinear parameter identification tools are given to improve the precision of sensor-specific characteristic functions through eliminating the adversary effects of indoor light attenuation and manufacturing defects. The newly designed instrument, endowed with the proposed tools, is a smart device that is automatic, fast, efficient, and accurate. Outdoor experimental results show that the instrument calibrates the sensor in a good accuracy up to 0.23&#x00b0; at the presence of 16&#x00b0; manufacture errors of inclines. Therefore, the instrument is promising in mass production in terms of intelligent manufacture process.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to the application of dual inverters in the structure of open-end winding permanent-magnet synchronous machine system with isolated dc bus, the double number of switching devices are employed and thus the switching actions within one pulsewidth modulation (PWM) period are relatively high. To reduce the switching actions, an improved modulation technique is proposed in this letter. In the proposed technique, the reference voltages in the synchronous coordinate system are transferred to the three-phase stationary frame through Park transformation and thus the duration time corresponding to the three-phase windings can be directly obtained. On this basis, by synchronously adjusting the duration time of three phases, the maximum one can be adjusted to be the control period while their resultant voltage remains constant. Furthermore, the switching actions are assigned to the switching devices based on the polarity of duration time for each phase, with the principle of keeping the switching device on one side clamped. The novelty of the proposed technique is that it can be universally applied to minimize the number of switching actions within one PWM cycle for any kind of voltage ratio of the system without sector identification. The experimental validation of the proposed scheme is given to validate its effectiveness.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>People constantly share their photographs with others through various social media sites. With the aid of the privacy settings provided by social media sites, image owners can designate scope of sharing, e.g., close friends and acquaintances. However, even if the owner of a photograph carefully sets the privacy setting to exclude a given individual who is not supposed to see the photograph, the photograph may still eventually reach a wider audience, including those clearly undesired through unanticipated channels of disclosure, causing a privacy breach. Moreover, it is often the case that a given image involves multiple stakeholders who are also depicted in the photograph. Due to various personalities, it is even more challenging to reach agreement on the privacy settings for these multi-owner photographs. In this paper, we propose a privacy risk reminder system, called REMIND, which estimates the probability that a shared photograph may be seen by unwanted people-through the social graph-who are not included in the original sharing list. We tackle this problem from a novel angle by digging into the big data regarding image sharing history. Specifically, the social media providers possess a huge amount of image sharing information (e.g., what photographs are shared with whom) of their users. By analyzing and modeling such rich information, we build a sophisticated probability model that efficiently aggregates the image disclosure probabilities along different possible image propagation chains and loops. If the computed disclosure probability indicates high risks of privacy breach, a reminder is issued to the image owner to help revise the privacy settings (or, at least, inform the user about this accidental disclosure risk). The proposed REMIND system also has a nice feature of policy harmonization that helps resolve privacy differences in multi-owner photographs. We have carried out a user study to validate the rationale of our proposed solutions and also conducte-
 experimental studies to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed REMIND system.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Online romance scams are a prevalent form of mass-marketing fraud in the West, and yet few studies have presented data-driven responses to this problem. In this type of scam, fraudsters craft fake profiles and manually interact with their victims. Because of the characteristics of this type of fraud and how dating sites operate, traditional detection methods (e.g., those used in spam filtering) are ineffective. In this paper, we investigate the archetype of online dating profiles used in this form of fraud, including their use of demographics, profile descriptions, and images, shedding light on both the strategies deployed by scammers to appeal to victims and the traits of victims themselves. Furthermore, in response to the severe financial and psychological harm caused by dating fraud, we develop a system to detect romance scammers on online dating platforms. This paper presents the first fully described system for automatically detecting this fraud. Our aim is to provide an early detection system to stop romance scammers as they create fraudulent profiles or before they engage with potential victims. Previous research has indicated that the victims of romance scams score highly on scales for idealized romantic beliefs. We combine a range of structured, unstructured, and deep-learned features that capture these beliefs in order to build a detection system. Our ensemble machine-learning approach is robust to the omission of profile details and performs at high accuracy (97%) in a hold-out validation set. The system enables development of automated tools for dating site providers and individual users.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We investigate the effect of outdated channel state information (CSI) on the secrecy performance of wireless-powered untrusted relay networks, in which the relay is a potential eavesdropper. To keep the information secret from this untrusted relay, the destination sends a jamming signal to the relay when the source transmits an information signal. At the same time, the relay harvests energy from the radio-frequency power, and forwards the received signals to the destination using this harvested energy. To determine the proportions of energy harvesting and information processing, the relay makes use of relaying based on power splitting or time switching policy. Although the destination tries to remove the jamming signal from the relaying signal, it cannot cancel out the jamming signal perfectly due to imperfect channel reciprocity caused by the outdated CSI; this residual jamming signal therefore has a negative impact on secrecy performance. In this scenario, we derive the closed-form expressions for the outage probability and average secrecy rate, and find the jamming power ratio, power splitting ratio, and time switching ratio to optimize these secrecy performance metrics. The numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of our analysis, and show that the proposed secure relaying protocols achieve a near-optimal secrecy performance, as well as outperforming the conventional scheme without the jamming power control.

<p>This study presents a deep neural network architecture that achieves state of the art multi-session verification and identification performance for Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission (TEOAE) biometric system. TEOAE is a 20ms long response generated by the ear that is naturally strong against falsification, and replay attacks. It can be measured using a device with a speaker and multiple microphones. Previous TEAOE authentication methods focused on single-session or mixed-session performance. Our method focuses on multi-session authentication performance. We train a neural network model that generates a TEOAE embedding that is separable in Euclidean space by using the triplet loss function. These embeddings are used to create identity templates which are used to authenticate the user. We achieved identification accuracy of 99.3 &#x00b1; 1.04&#x0025;, and achieved an EER(Equal Error Rate) of 0.187 &#x00b1; 0.146&#x0025; for verification scenarios. Our method has achieved 7.56&#x0025; performance increase for identification scenarios and 13.3&#x0025; performance increase for verification scenarios over previous methods when averaged across all tests.

<p>Benefiting from the quick development of deep convolutional neural networks, especially fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), remarkable progresses have been achieved on salient object detection recently. Nevertheless, these FCNs based methods are still challenging to generate high resolution saliency maps, and also not applicable for subsequent applications due to their heavy model weights. In this paper, we propose a compact and efficient deep network with high accuracy for salient object detection. Firstly, we propose two strategies for initial prediction, one is a new designed multi-scale context module, the other is incorporating hand-crafted saliency priors. Secondly, we employ residual learning to refine it progressively by only learning the residual in each side-output, which can be achieved with few convolutional parameters, therefore leads to high compactness and high efficiency. Finally, we further design a novel top-down reverse attention block to guide the above side-output residual learning. Specifically, the current predicted salient regions are used to erase its side-output feature, thus the missing object parts and details can be efficiently learned from these unerased regions, which results in more complete detection and high accuracy. Extensive experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed network performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches, and shows advantages in simplicity, compactness and efficiency.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Seismic image interpolation is a currently popular research subject in modern reflection seismology. The interpolation problem is generally treated as a process of inversion. Under the compressed sensing framework, various sparse transformations and low-rank constraints based methods have great performances in recovering irregularly missing traces. However, in the case of regularly missing traces, their applications are limited because of the strong spatial aliasing energies. In addition, the erratic noise always poses a serious impact on the interpolation results obtained by the sparse transformations and low-rank constraints-based methods,. This is because the erratic noise is far from satisfying the statistical assumption behind these methods. In this study, we propose a mathematical morphology-based interpolation technique, which constrains the morphological scale of the model in the inversion process. The inversion problem is solved by the shaping regularization approach. The mathematical morphological constraint (MMC)-based interpolation technique has a satisfactory robustness to the spatial aliasing and erratic energies. We provide a detailed algorithmic framework and discuss the extension from 2D to higher dimensional version and the back operator in the shaping inversion. A group of numerical examples demonstrates the successful performance of the proposed technique.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The human visual system tends to consider saliency of an object as a whole. Some object-level saliency detection methods have been proposed by leveraging object proposals in bounding boxes, and regarding the entire bounding box as one candidate salient region. However, the bounding boxes can not provide exact object position and a lot of pixels in bounding boxes belong to the background. Consequently, background pixels in bounding box also show high saliency. Besides, acquiring object proposals needs high time cost. In order to compute object-level saliency, we consider region growing from some seed superpixels, to find one surrounding region which probably represents the whole object. The desired surrounding region has similar appearance inside and obvious difference with the outside, which is proposed as maximally stable region (MSR) in this paper. In addition, one effective seed superpixel selection strategy is presented to improve speed. MSR based saliency detection is more robust than pixel or superpixel level methods and object proposal based methods. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods at 50 FPS. Compared with deep learning based methods, we show worse performance, but with about 1200-1600 times faster, which means better trade-off between performance and speed.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we develop a concise but efficient network architecture called linear compressing based skip-connecting network (LCSCNet) for image super-resolution. Compared with two representative network architectures with skip connections, ResNet and DenseNet, a linear compressing layer is designed in LCSCNet for skip connection, which connects former feature maps and distinguishes them from newly-explored feature maps. In this way, the proposed LCSCNet enjoys the merits of the distinguish feature treatment of DenseNet and the parameter-economic form of ResNet. Moreover, to better exploit hierarchical information from both low and high levels of various receptive fields in deep models, inspired by gate units in LSTM, we also propose an adaptive element-wise fusion strategy with multi-supervised training. Experimental results in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms validate the effectiveness of LCSCNet.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Previous research on no-reference (NR) quality assessment of multiply-distorted images focused mainly on three distortion types (white noise, Gaussian blur, and JPEG compression), while in practice images can be contaminated by many other common distortions due to the various stages of processing. Although MUSIQUE (MUltiply- and Singly-distorted Image QUality Estimator) [Zhang et al., TIP 2018] is a successful NR algorithm, this approach is still limited to the three distortion types. In this paper, we extend MUSIQUE to MUSIQUE-II to blindly assess the quality of images corrupted by five distortion types (white noise, Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, JPEG2000 compression, and contrast change) and their combinations. The proposed MUSIQUE-II algorithm builds upon the classification and parameter-estimation framework of its predecessor by using more advanced models and a more comprehensive set of distortion-sensitive features. Specifically, MUSIQUE-II relies on a three-layer classification model to identify 19 distortion types. To predict the five distortion parameter values, MUSIQUE-II extracts an additional 14 contrast features and employs a multi-layer probability-weighting rule. Finally, MUSIQUE-II employs a new most-apparent-distortion strategy to adaptively combine five quality scores based on outputs of three classification models. Experimental results tested on three multiply-distorted and six singly-distorted image quality databases show that MUSIQUE-II yields not only a substantial improvement in quality predictive performance as compared with its predecessor, but also highly competitive performance relative to other state-of-the-art FR/NR IQA algorithms.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, we develop a navigation strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for mobile robots. Because of the large difference between simulation and reality, most of the trained DRL models cannot be directly migrated into real robots. Moreover, how to explore in a sparsely rewarded environment is also a long-standing problem of DRL. This article proposes an end-to-end navigation planner that translates sparse laser ranging results into movement actions. Using this highly abstract data as input, agents trained by simulation can be extended to the real scene for practical application. For map-less navigation across obstacles and traps, it is difficult to reach the target via random exploration. Curiosity is used to encourage agents to explore the state of an environment that has not been visited and as an additional reward for exploring behavior. The agent relies on the self-supervised model to predict the next state, based on the current state and the executed action. The prediction error is used as a measure of curiosity. The experimental results demonstrate that without any manual design features and previous demonstrations, the proposed method accomplishes map-less navigation in complex environments. Through a reward signal that is enhanced by intrinsic motivation, the agent explores more efficiently, and the learned strategy is more reliable.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This article presents a noncooperative game-theoretic framework to model the social welfare optimization (SWO) problem with load aggregators participating in integrated economic dispatch and demand response. In the proposed framework, distribution system operators interact with generation units and load aggregators to maximize the overall social welfare. The proposed SWO problem addresses practical system constraints and falls into the scope of mixed integer nonlinear programs, which cannot be well handled by existing distributed algorithms. The proposed SWO problem is formulated by a special noncooperative strategic game, known as the potential game, and solved by a revised version of the spatial adaptive play under network anomaly. It is shown that the proposed framework has guaranteed convergence to a Nash equilibrium that is also a global optimizer. Simulations on a 15-generator benchmark distribution network have been conducted to validate the proposed framework.

<p>Artificial intelligence methods applied in smart home environments can give a ubiquitous support of people, provide automatic control of system settings to lower the costs of operation, improve energetic efficiency, and longer endurance of components. In this article, we discuss the use of neural networks and rule-based systems as the components of automatic control over house elements. In the proposed framework, we store the knowledge and teach the system about the home in parallel to operation. Initially, the system starts with global settings, however, data are collected during use and parallel to this regular training is run so when the new knowledge guarantees higher efficiency, the system switch to use it. We have developed a new neural-based mechanism with rules control method to lower the costs of operation while keeping the needs of users. The components were tested and discussed due to practical application in our everyday life.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In modern Internet of Things (IoT), visual analysis and predictions are often performed by deep learning models. Salient object detection (SOD) is a fundamental preprocessing for these applications. Executing SOD on the fog devices is a challenging task due to the diversity of data and fog devices. To adopt convolutional neural networks (CNN) on fog&#x2013;cloud infrastructures for SOD-based applications, we introduce a semisupervised adversarial learning method in this article. The proposed model, named as SaliencyGAN, is empowered by a novel concatenated generative adversarial network (GAN) framework with partially shared parameters. The backbone CNN can be chosen flexibly based on the specific devices and applications. In the meanwhile, our method uses both the labeled and unlabeled data from different problem domains for training. Using multiple popular benchmark datasets, we compared state-of-the-art baseline methods to our SaliencyGAN obtained with 10&#x2013;100&#x0025; labeled training data. SaliencyGAN gained performance comparable to the supervised baselines when the percentage of labeled data reached 30&#x0025;, and outperformed the weakly supervised and unsupervised baselines. Furthermore, our ablation study shows that SaliencyGAN were more robust to the common &#x201c;mode missing&#x201d; (or &#x201c;mode collapse&#x201d;) issue compared to the selected popular GAN models. The visualized ablation results have proved that SaliencyGAN learned a better estimation of data distributions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first IoT-oriented semisupervised SOD method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Scheduling of a hot strip mill is an important decision problem in the steel manufacturing industry. Previous studies on the hot strip mill scheduling problem have mostly neglected the random factors in production. However, random variations in processing times are inevitable due to unpredictable delays and disturbances. In this article, we adopt a robust optimization approach to deal with the uncertainty in processing times. The advantage is that no assumption has to be made regarding the distribution of random data, and the obtained schedule will remain strictly feasible when the variations have not exceeded a predefined uncertainty set. First, a mixed-integer linear programming model is presented to formulate the robust scheduling problem. Then, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm, which combines ant colony system (ACS) and enhanced local search, is proposed to provide an efficient solution to the problem. Finally, extensive computational experiments involving both randomly generated and real-world instances have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. It is shown that the algorithm achieves optimality for small instances and outperforms two state-of-the-art metaheuristics when used to solve large instances.
