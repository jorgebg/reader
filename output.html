<div class="itemdescription">
<p>When working with joint collections of confidential data from multiple
sources, e.g., in cloud-based multi-party computation scenarios, the ownership
relation between data providers and their inputs itself is confidential
information. Protecting data providers' privacy desires a function for secretly
shuffling the data collection. We present the first efficient secure
multi-party computation protocol for secret shuffling in scenarios with a
central server. Based on a novel approach to random index distribution, our
solution enables the randomization of the order of a sequence of encrypted data
such that no observer can map between elements of the original sequence and the
shuffled sequence with probability better than guessing. It allows for
shuffling data encrypted under an additively homomorphic cryptosystem with
constant round complexity and linear computational complexity. Being a
general-purpose protocol, it is of relevance for a variety of practical use
cases.

<p>Online Automated Privacy Policy Generators (APPGs) are tools used by app
developers to quickly create app privacy policies which are required by privacy
regulations to be incorporated to each mobile app. The creation of these tools
brings convenience to app developers; however, the quality of these tools puts
developers and stakeholders at legal risk. In this paper, we conduct an
empirical study to assess the quality of online APPGs. We analyze the
completeness of privacy policies, determine what categories and items should be
covered in a complete privacy policy, and conduct APPG assessment with
boilerplate apps. The results of assessment show that due to the lack of static
or dynamic analysis of app's behavior, developers may encounter two types of
issues caused by APPGs. First, the generated policies could be incomplete
because they do not cover all the essential items required by a privacy policy.
Second, some generated privacy policies contain unnecessary personal
information collection or arbitrary commitments inconsistent with user input.
Ultimately, the defects of APPGs may potentially lead to serious legal issues.
We hope that the results and insights developed in this paper can motivate the
healthy and ethical development of APPGs towards generating a more complete,
accurate, and robust privacy policy.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Local differential privacy (LDP) has received much interest recently. In
existing protocols with LDP guarantees, a user encodes and perturbs his data
locally before sharing it to the aggregator. In common practice, however, users
would prefer not to answer all the questions due to different
privacy-preserving preferences for different questions, which leads to data
missing or the loss of data quality. In this paper, we demonstrate a new
approach for addressing the challenges of data perturbation with consideration
of users' privacy preferences. Specifically, we first propose BiSample: a
bidirectional sampling technique value perturbation in the framework of LDP.
Then we combine the BiSample mechanism with users' privacy preferences for
missing data perturbation. Theoretical analysis and experiments on a set of
datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms.

The value of septoplasty is undisputed for treating symptomatic nasal obstruction caused by significant anterior septal deformity with ipsilateral mechanical obstruction. In most patients, however, a combination of mucosal dysregulation, septal pathology, inspiratory collapse of the ala, psychological factors, and potentially altered trigeminal airflow perception have an influence on nasal obstruction.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Energy storage units (such as battery or ultracapacitor) can help to reduce the power fluctuation in the impedance source network converter applications such as the photovoltaic (PV) and fuel cells systems. Due to the unknown dynamic characteristics of the energy stored impedance network, the unexpected oscillation and inrush currents in dynamic process might threaten the storage device safety. In this article, an energy stored quasi-Z-source converter with the battery is modeled and analyzed including the transient capacitor current. The impact of the network internal resonance on the battery current control loop is mathematically explored. The resulted conflict between the zero steady-state error and bandwidth requirement is revealed. That yields the sacrifice and limitation of the closed-loop dynamic performance in the conventional methods. An active damping technique is then proposed to ensure the extended bandwidth and better dynamic performances under different state of charge (SOC) occasions. The theoretical analysis and performance are both verified by the simulations and experiments.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Current flow controllers (CFCs) are power electronics-based devices that may remove some technical barriers preventing multiterminal high-voltage direct current (MTdc) grid deployment. In this paper, an interline CFC topology is investigated. The single H-bridge CFC (1B-CFC) alters the grid power flow by transferring power between neighboring dc lines. The operation and control of a 1B-CFC under a single modulation scheme is presented. A control strategy has been proposed to provide pole balancing support during imbalance conditions. Small-scale prototypes have been developed to demonstrate the functionality and operational range of the device. To this end, an experimental MTdc grid test-rig has been employed. It is shown that a 1B-CFC could be used to limit the dc line current and, additionally, it can be employed to enable asymmetrical tapping of dc lines. For completeness, the performance of the device has been experimentally validated under line overloading, pole imbalance conditions, and a pole-to-pole dc fault.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Increase in the deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs) has triggered a new trend to redesign electricity markets as consumer-centric markets relying on peer-to-peer (P2P) approaches. In the P2P markets, players can directly negotiate under bilateral energy trading to match demand and supply. The trading scheme should be designed adequately to incentivise players to participate in the trading process actively. This article proposes a decentralized P2P energy trading scheme for electricity markets with high penetration of DERs. A novel algorithm using primal-dual gradient method is described to clear the market in a fully decentralized manner without interaction of any central entity. Also, to incorporate technical constraints in the energy trading, line flow constraints are modeled in the bilateral energy trading to avoid overloaded or congested lines in the system. This market structure respects market players&#x2019; preferences by allowing bilateral energy trading with product differentiation. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using simulation studies, and it is found that market players can trade energy to maximize their welfare without violating line flow constraints. Also, compared with other similar methods for P2P trading, the proposed approach needs lower data exchange and has a faster convergence.

<p>Robust and accurate control of a flapping-wing aerial vehicle (FWAV) system is a challenging problem due to the existence of backlash-like hysteresis nonlinearity. This paper proposes uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE)-based control with output feedback for FWAV systems. The approach enables the acquisition of the approximate plant model with only a partial knowledge of system parameters. For the design of the controller, only the bandwidth information of the unknown plant model is needed, which is available through the UDE filter. The stability analysis of the closed-loop system with the UDE-based controller is presented. It is shown that the proposed control scheme can ensure the boundedness of the control signals. A number of numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the satisfactory trajectory tracking performance of the proposed method.

<p>This article presents a sequential fusion approach for state estimation of networked multisensor nonlinear systems, where sensors and estimators are allowed to work asynchronously. Both sequential measurement fusion (SMF) and sequential state fusion (SSF) estimators are designed, where the unscented filtering method is used in the design of the local SMF estimator, and the matrix weighting method is applied in the design of the SSF estimator. It is shown that the proposed SSF estimators provide a satisfactory estimation precision that is close to the centralized batch state fusion (BSF) estimator, while requiring smaller computation burden as compared with the BSF estimator. Both simulations and experiments of a moving target tracking system are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed sequential fusion methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We present a feature-based image registration method, the stepwise image registration (SIR), with a closed-form solution. Our SIR creates an inlier pool and a candidate pool as the initialization, and then gradually enriches the inlier pool and refines the transformation. In each step, the enriched correspondence exclusively tunes the transformation coefficient within the confirmed inlier pairs, instead of updating the mapping using the complete putative set. In turn, the refined transformation prunes inconsistent mismatches to alleviate the incoming matching ambiguity. The context-aware locality measure (CALM) is designed for dissimilarity measure. The capability of the CALM can be enhanced by the progressive inlier pool enrichment. Finally, a retrieval process is performed based on the finest CALM and alignment, by which the inlier pool is maximized. Extensive experiments of enrichment evaluation, feature matching, image registration, and image retrieval demonstrate the favorable performance of our SIR against state-of-the-art methods. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/sucv/SIR.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>People constantly share their photographs with others through various social media sites. With the aid of the privacy settings provided by social media sites, image owners can designate scope of sharing, e.g., close friends and acquaintances. However, even if the owner of a photograph carefully sets the privacy setting to exclude a given individual who is not supposed to see the photograph, the photograph may still eventually reach a wider audience, including those clearly undesired through unanticipated channels of disclosure, causing a privacy breach. Moreover, it is often the case that a given image involves multiple stakeholders who are also depicted in the photograph. Due to various personalities, it is even more challenging to reach agreement on the privacy settings for these multi-owner photographs. In this paper, we propose a privacy risk reminder system, called REMIND, which estimates the probability that a shared photograph may be seen by unwanted people-through the social graph-who are not included in the original sharing list. We tackle this problem from a novel angle by digging into the big data regarding image sharing history. Specifically, the social media providers possess a huge amount of image sharing information (e.g., what photographs are shared with whom) of their users. By analyzing and modeling such rich information, we build a sophisticated probability model that efficiently aggregates the image disclosure probabilities along different possible image propagation chains and loops. If the computed disclosure probability indicates high risks of privacy breach, a reminder is issued to the image owner to help revise the privacy settings (or, at least, inform the user about this accidental disclosure risk). The proposed REMIND system also has a nice feature of policy harmonization that helps resolve privacy differences in multi-owner photographs. We have carried out a user study to validate the rationale of our proposed solutions and also conducte-
 experimental studies to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed REMIND system.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The side-channel leakage is a consequence of program execution in a computer processor, and understanding relationship between code execution and information leakage is a necessary step in estimating information leakage and its capacity limits. This paper proposes a methodology to relate program execution to electromagnetic side-channel emanations and estimates side-channel information capacity created by execution of series of instructions (e.g., a function, a procedure, or a program) in a processor. To model dependence among program instructions in a code, we propose to use Markov source model, which includes the dependencies among sequence of instructions as well as dependencies among instructions as they pass through a pipeline of the processor. The emitted electromagnetic (EM) signals during instruction executions are natural choice for the inputs into the model. To obtain the channel inputs for the proposed model, we derive a mathematical relationship between the emanated instruction signal power (ESP) and total emanated signal power while running a program. Then, we derive the leakage capacity of EM side channels created by execution of series of instructions in a processor. Finally, we provide experimental results to demonstrate that leakages could be severe and that a dedicated attacker could obtain important information.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

Because of the characteristics of this type of fraud and how dating sites operate, traditional detection methods (e.g., those used in spam filtering) are ineffective. In this paper, we investigate the archetype of online dating profiles used in this form of fraud, including their use of demographics, profile descriptions, and images, shedding light on both the strategies deployed by scammers to appeal to victims and the traits of victims themselves. Furthermore, in response to the severe financial and psychological harm caused by dating fraud, we develop a system to detect romance scammers on online dating platforms. This paper presents the first fully described system for automatically detecting this fraud. Our aim is to provide an early detection system to stop romance scammers as they create fraudulent profiles or before they engage with potential victims. Previous research has indicated that the victims of romance scams score highly on scales for idealized romantic beliefs. We combine a range of structured, unstructured, and deep-learned features that capture these beliefs in order to build a detection system. Our ensemble machine-learning approach is robust to the omission of profile details and performs at high accuracy (97%) in a hold-out validation set. The system enables development of automated tools for dating site providers and individual users.

<p>This study presents a deep neural network architecture that achieves state of the art multi-session verification and identification performance for Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission (TEOAE) biometric system. TEOAE is a 20ms long response generated by the ear that is naturally strong against falsification, and replay attacks. It can be measured using a device with a speaker and multiple microphones. Previous TEAOE authentication methods focused on single-session or mixed-session performance. Our method focuses on multi-session authentication performance. We train a neural network model that generates a TEOAE embedding that is separable in Euclidean space by using the triplet loss function. These embeddings are used to create identity templates which are used to authenticate the user. We achieved identification accuracy of 99.3 &#x00b1; 1.04&#x0025;, and achieved an EER(Equal Error Rate) of 0.187 &#x00b1; 0.146&#x0025; for verification scenarios. Our method has achieved 7.56&#x0025; performance increase for identification scenarios and 13.3&#x0025; performance increase for verification scenarios over previous methods when averaged across all tests.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Benefiting from the quick development of deep convolutional neural networks, especially fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), remarkable progresses have been achieved on salient object detection recently. Nevertheless, these FCNs based methods are still challenging to generate high resolution saliency maps, and also not applicable for subsequent applications due to their heavy model weights. In this paper, we propose a compact and efficient deep network with high accuracy for salient object detection. Firstly, we propose two strategies for initial prediction, one is a new designed multi-scale context module, the other is incorporating hand-crafted saliency priors. Secondly, we employ residual learning to refine it progressively by only learning the residual in each side-output, which can be achieved with few convolutional parameters, therefore leads to high compactness and high efficiency. Finally, we further design a novel top-down reverse attention block to guide the above side-output residual learning. Specifically, the current predicted salient regions are used to erase its side-output feature, thus the missing object parts and details can be efficiently learned from these unerased regions, which results in more complete detection and high accuracy. Extensive experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed network performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches, and shows advantages in simplicity, compactness and efficiency.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Seismic image interpolation is a currently popular research subject in modern reflection seismology. The interpolation problem is generally treated as a process of inversion. Under the compressed sensing framework, various sparse transformations and low-rank constraints based methods have great performances in recovering irregularly missing traces. However, in the case of regularly missing traces, their applications are limited because of the strong spatial aliasing energies. In addition, the erratic noise always poses a serious impact on the interpolation results obtained by the sparse transformations and low-rank constraints-based methods,. This is because the erratic noise is far from satisfying the statistical assumption behind these methods. In this study, we propose a mathematical morphology-based interpolation technique, which constrains the morphological scale of the model in the inversion process. The inversion problem is solved by the shaping regularization approach. The mathematical morphological constraint (MMC)-based interpolation technique has a satisfactory robustness to the spatial aliasing and erratic energies. We provide a detailed algorithmic framework and discuss the extension from 2D to higher dimensional version and the back operator in the shaping inversion. A group of numerical examples demonstrates the successful performance of the proposed technique.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The human visual system tends to consider saliency of an object as a whole. Some object-level saliency detection methods have been proposed by leveraging object proposals in bounding boxes, and regarding the entire bounding box as one candidate salient region. However, the bounding boxes can not provide exact object position and a lot of pixels in bounding boxes belong to the background. Consequently, background pixels in bounding box also show high saliency. Besides, acquiring object proposals needs high time cost. In order to compute object-level saliency, we consider region growing from some seed superpixels, to find one surrounding region which probably represents the whole object. The desired surrounding region has similar appearance inside and obvious difference with the outside, which is proposed as maximally stable region (MSR) in this paper. In addition, one effective seed superpixel selection strategy is presented to improve speed. MSR based saliency detection is more robust than pixel or superpixel level methods and object proposal based methods. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods at 50 FPS. Compared with deep learning based methods, we show worse performance, but with about 1200-1600 times faster, which means better trade-off between performance and speed.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we develop a concise but efficient network architecture called linear compressing based skip-connecting network (LCSCNet) for image super-resolution. Compared with two representative network architectures with skip connections, ResNet and DenseNet, a linear compressing layer is designed in LCSCNet for skip connection, which connects former feature maps and distinguishes them from newly-explored feature maps. In this way, the proposed LCSCNet enjoys the merits of the distinguish feature treatment of DenseNet and the parameter-economic form of ResNet. Moreover, to better exploit hierarchical information from both low and high levels of various receptive fields in deep models, inspired by gate units in LSTM, we also propose an adaptive element-wise fusion strategy with multi-supervised training. Experimental results in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms validate the effectiveness of LCSCNet.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, we develop a navigation strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for mobile robots. Because of the large difference between simulation and reality, most of the trained DRL models cannot be directly migrated into real robots. Moreover, how to explore in a sparsely rewarded environment is also a long-standing problem of DRL. This article proposes an end-to-end navigation planner that translates sparse laser ranging results into movement actions. Using this highly abstract data as input, agents trained by simulation can be extended to the real scene for practical application. For map-less navigation across obstacles and traps, it is difficult to reach the target via random exploration. Curiosity is used to encourage agents to explore the state of an environment that has not been visited and as an additional reward for exploring behavior. The agent relies on the self-supervised model to predict the next state, based on the current state and the executed action. The prediction error is used as a measure of curiosity. The experimental results demonstrate that without any manual design features and previous demonstrations, the proposed method accomplishes map-less navigation in complex environments. Through a reward signal that is enhanced by intrinsic motivation, the agent explores more efficiently, and the learned strategy is more reliable.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This article presents a noncooperative game-theoretic framework to model the social welfare optimization (SWO) problem with load aggregators participating in integrated economic dispatch and demand response. In the proposed framework, distribution system operators interact with generation units and load aggregators to maximize the overall social welfare. The proposed SWO problem addresses practical system constraints and falls into the scope of mixed integer nonlinear programs, which cannot be well handled by existing distributed algorithms. The proposed SWO problem is formulated by a special noncooperative strategic game, known as the potential game, and solved by a revised version of the spatial adaptive play under network anomaly. It is shown that the proposed framework has guaranteed convergence to a Nash equilibrium that is also a global optimizer. Simulations on a 15-generator benchmark distribution network have been conducted to validate the proposed framework.

<p>Artificial intelligence methods applied in smart home environments can give a ubiquitous support of people, provide automatic control of system settings to lower the costs of operation, improve energetic efficiency, and longer endurance of components. In this article, we discuss the use of neural networks and rule-based systems as the components of automatic control over house elements. In the proposed framework, we store the knowledge and teach the system about the home in parallel to operation. Initially, the system starts with global settings, however, data are collected during use and parallel to this regular training is run so when the new knowledge guarantees higher efficiency, the system switch to use it. We have developed a new neural-based mechanism with rules control method to lower the costs of operation while keeping the needs of users. The components were tested and discussed due to practical application in our everyday life.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In modern Internet of Things (IoT), visual analysis and predictions are often performed by deep learning models. Salient object detection (SOD) is a fundamental preprocessing for these applications. Executing SOD on the fog devices is a challenging task due to the diversity of data and fog devices. To adopt convolutional neural networks (CNN) on fog&#x2013;cloud infrastructures for SOD-based applications, we introduce a semisupervised adversarial learning method in this article. The proposed model, named as SaliencyGAN, is empowered by a novel concatenated generative adversarial network (GAN) framework with partially shared parameters. The backbone CNN can be chosen flexibly based on the specific devices and applications. In the meanwhile, our method uses both the labeled and unlabeled data from different problem domains for training. Using multiple popular benchmark datasets, we compared state-of-the-art baseline methods to our SaliencyGAN obtained with 10&#x2013;100&#x0025; labeled training data. SaliencyGAN gained performance comparable to the supervised baselines when the percentage of labeled data reached 30&#x0025;, and outperformed the weakly supervised and unsupervised baselines. Furthermore, our ablation study shows that SaliencyGAN were more robust to the common &#x201c;mode missing&#x201d; (or &#x201c;mode collapse&#x201d;) issue compared to the selected popular GAN models. The visualized ablation results have proved that SaliencyGAN learned a better estimation of data distributions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first IoT-oriented semisupervised SOD method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Scheduling of a hot strip mill is an important decision problem in the steel manufacturing industry. Previous studies on the hot strip mill scheduling problem have mostly neglected the random factors in production. However, random variations in processing times are inevitable due to unpredictable delays and disturbances. In this article, we adopt a robust optimization approach to deal with the uncertainty in processing times. The advantage is that no assumption has to be made regarding the distribution of random data, and the obtained schedule will remain strictly feasible when the variations have not exceeded a predefined uncertainty set. First, a mixed-integer linear programming model is presented to formulate the robust scheduling problem. Then, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm, which combines ant colony system (ACS) and enhanced local search, is proposed to provide an efficient solution to the problem. Finally, extensive computational experiments involving both randomly generated and real-world instances have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. It is shown that the algorithm achieves optimality for small instances and outperforms two state-of-the-art metaheuristics when used to solve large instances.
