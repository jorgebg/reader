<p>To coincide with the 70th anniversary of the National Health Service (NHS) on July 5, a new NHS app enabling patients to make appointments, order repeat prescriptions, access their general practitioner (GP) records, and make urgent medical queries was announced by Jeremy Hunt, then UK Secretary for Health and Social Care. The app, developed by NHS England and NHS Digital, will be freely available from December, 2018. Hunt acknowledged that while technology has transformed many sectors, the health sector has remained comparatively unchanged.

<p>Immune checkpoint blockade has altered the treatment landscape for many cancers. In the first wave of immunotherapy approvals, studies showed that patients with highly immunogenic tumours such as malignant melanoma gained substantial survival benefits from treatment with anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 antibodies.1,2 These early wins have given way to mixed evidence for immunotherapy for tumours on the margin of immune exclusion, such as gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Anti-PD-1 therapy has been shown to be associated with modest response rates and an improvement in overall survival in chemorefractory gastro-oesophageal cancer.

<p>Enteric viruses, particularly rotaviruses and noroviruses, are a leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. Rotaviruses primarily affect young children, accounting for almost 40% of hospital admissions for diarrhoea and 200&#8200;000 deaths worldwide, with the majority of deaths occurring in developing countries. Two vaccines against rotavirus were licensed in 2006 and have been implemented in 95 countries as of April, 2018. Data from eight high-income and middle-income countries showed a 49&#8211;89% decline in rotavirus-associated hospital admissions and a 17&#8211;55% decline in all-cause gastroenteritis-associated hospital admissions among children younger than 5 years, within 2 years of vaccine introduction.

<p>Image recoloring is a technique that can transfer image color or theme and result in an imperceptible change in human eyes. Although image recoloring is one of the most important image manipulation techniques, there is no special method designed for detecting this kind of forgery. In this paper, we propose a trainable end-to-end system for distinguishing recolored images from natural images. The proposed network takes the original image and two derived inputs based on illumination consistency and inter-channel correlation of the original input into consideration and outputs the probability that it is recolored. Our algorithm adopts a convolutional neural network (CNN)- based deep architecture, which consists of three feature extraction blocks and a feature fusion module. To train the deep neural network, we synthesize a data set comprised of recolored images and corresponding ground truth using different recoloring methods. Extensive experimental results on the recolored images generated by various methods show that our proposed network is well generalized and very robust.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Contactless personal identification using biometrics characteristics brings multifaceted advantages with improved hygiene, user security, and the convenience. Such imaging also generates deformation-free palmprint images which can lead to higher matching accuracy as the ground truth information is better preserved as compared with those from contact-based imaging. Advancement of palmprint identification technologies for new domains requires research using larger palmprint databases that are acquired from more realistic populations, under contactless, ambient, and indoor and outdoor environments. This paper presents such a new contactless palmprint database acquired from 600 different subjects, which is the largest to date and is also made available in the public domain. Unlike contactless fingerprints, contactless palmprint images often illustrate pose deformations along the optical axis of the camera, which also degrades the matching accuracy. This paper also introduces a new approach for matching contactless palmprint images using more accurate deformation alignment and matching. The experimental results are validated on three publicly available contactless palmprint databases. Comparative experimental results presented in this paper indicate consistently outperforming results over competing methods in the literature and validate the effectiveness of the investigated approach. These results also serve as baseline performance to advance much needed further research using the most challenging and largest database introduced from this paper.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Online social networks have now become the most popular platforms for people to share information with others. Along with this, there is a serious threat to individuals&#x2019; privacy. One privacy risk comes from the sharing of co-owned data, i.e., when a user shares a data item that involves multiple users, some users&#x2019; privacy may be compromised, since different users generally have different opinions on who can access the data. How to design a collaborative management mechanism to deal with such a privacy issue has recently attracted much attention. In this paper, we propose a trust-based mechanism to realize collaborative privacy management. Basically, a user decides whether or not to post a data item based on the aggregated opinion of all involved users. The trust values between users are used to weight users&#x2019; opinions, and the values are updated according to users&#x2019; privacy loss. Moreover, the user can make a tradeoff between data sharing and privacy preserving by tuning the parameter of the proposed mechanism. We formulate the selecting of the parameter as a multi-armed bandit problem and apply the upper confidence bound policy to solve the problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the trust-based mechanism can encourage the user to be considerate of others&#x2019; privacy, and the proposed bandit approach can bring the user a high payoff.

When the channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropper is not available at the transmitter, we calculate the probability of secure connectivity using the Wyner coding scheme and show that hiding the receiver at the corner is beneficial at high rates of the transmitted code words and detrimental at low transmission rates. When the CSI is available, we show that the average secrecy capacity is higher when the receiver is located at the corner, even if the intensity of interferers in this case is four times higher than the intensity of interferers in the bulk. Therefore, boundaries can also be used as a secrecy enhancement technique for high-data-rate applications.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we investigate the accelerometer and gyroscope motion sensor-based cross-site input inference attacks that may compromise the security of many mobile Web users, and quantify the extent to which they can be effective. We formulate our attacks as a typical multi-class classification problem and build an inference framework that trains a classifier in the training phase and predicts the user&#x2019;s new inputs in the attacking phase. To make our attacks effective and realistic, we design unique techniques and address major data quality and data segmentation challenges. We intensively evaluate the effectiveness of our attacks using 98 691 keystrokes collected from 20 participants. Overall, our attacks are effective, for example, they are about 10.8 times more effective than the random guessing attacks regarding inferring letters. We also perform experiments to evaluate the effect of using the data perturbation defense techniques on decreasing the accuracy of our input inference attacks. Our results demonstrate that researchers, smartphone vendors, and app developers should pay serious attention to the motion sensor-based cross-site input inference attacks that can be pervasively performed, and start to design and deploy effective defense techniques.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The paper presents the application of delta-connected cascaded H-bridge multilevel static var generator (SVG) under unbalanced compensation currents or unbalanced supply voltages. Clustered balancing control for delta-connected SVG can be realized by injecting a zero-sequence current to the delta loop. But zero-sequence current injection may cause the high peak phase current which may break converter switches. The aim of this paper is to analyze the key factors that affect the maximum output current of the SVG with injecting zero-sequence current and acquire the quantitative relationship among unbalance compensation capability, the unbalance degree of the supply voltage, the initial phase of negative-sequence voltage, the unbalance degree of the compensation current, and the initial phase of negative-sequence current. On this foundation, the valid compensation range of delta-connected SVG under unbalanced conditions is obtained. Furthermore, the compensation characteristic of the negative-sequence current is deduced with the certain supply voltage, and the influence of supply voltage variation on the maximum output current for SVG is also considered with the certain compensation current. Finally, the correctness of the relevant theoretical analysis is verified by simulation and experiment.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A modularized design of an active charge equalizer and a charge equalization algorithm for a Li-ion battery pack are proposed in this paper. The equalizer consists of one module-balancing circuit and M cell-balancing circuits, where M is the number of modules in the battery pack. Each balancing circuit uses an inductor that is placed in a bridge of four bidirectional switches and works as an energy carrier, and uses a cell/module access network that enables energy transfer from one cell/module to another cell or module. The charge equalization between modules can be performed simultaneously with that between cells, so the proposed circuit can significantly reduce the time required to equalize the charges of all cells in the battery pack. The proposed circuit was tested under various charging/discharging conditions for a battery pack composed of four serially connected modules, with four serially connected cells per module. Experimental results show that the proposed circuit and algorithm comprise a good solution to balance a Li-ion battery pack.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper concerns a novel moving coil actuator integrated with a high-performance seat valve for use in digital displacement machines (DDM), which is an emerging fluid power technology that sets strict actuator requirements in order to get a high energy conversion efficiency. Hence, the mechanical switching time must be in the millisecond range and the actuator power consumption must be in range of few tens of watts. The objectives are twofold: First, establish a proof-of-concept for the integrated actuator/valve that relies on several principles and mechanisms new or uncommon in fluid power applications. Second, formulate and validate a transient numerical model describing the actuator/valve. A coupled simulation model is established to predict the switching performance in which transient electromagnetic finite-element-analysis with dynamic remeshing is coupled to a set of ordinary differential equations describing the motion dynamics. In this way, the movement induced hydromechanical fluid forces caused by rapid acceleration of the valve plunger is coupled with the electromagnetic dynamics. The proposed model is compared rigorously against measurements obtained from a series of experiments based on a fully operational valve prototype. Comparisons of, e.g., transient flux density, current, and plunger position, show that the model describes both the actuator and the valve motion very well. Finally, results are presented when testing the prototype valve in fully operational DDM to establish proof-of-concept for the proposed valve concept. The actuator/valve is shown to be capable of rapid switching in less than 4 ms, while only consuming approximately 45 W corresponding to 0.7% of the machine output power.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a nonsmooth composite control design methodology is investigated to tackle the exact tracking control problem for a general class of nonlinear systems with mismatched disturbances. By first introducing a saturated homogeneous disturbance observer to realize a finite-time performance recovery, a simple composite controller is then made feasible by virtue of the nonrecursive synthesis approach. A new feature is that under a less ambitious control objective, namely, semiglobal stability, various nonlinearity growth constraints for nonsmooth design approaches are essentially relaxed. Rigourous proof is provided to demonstrate the theoretical justifications. In order to illustrate the practical nature of the proposed design framework, a practical control application to series elastic actuator is presented. Experimental comparison results with the PID and finite-time controllers show significant performance improvements.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The papers in this special section on emerging multiport electrical machines and systems is to provide an opportunity for researchers and engineers from academia and/or industry, to exchange their enlightening ideas on analysis, design, and control of such new machine breeds, to identify the challenges in practical applications and to present the state-of-the-art solutions. Distinct from the conventional electric machines with only one electrical and one mechanical port, electrical machines featuring multiple electrical/mechanical ports provide a highly efficient, compact, and flexible manner to convert and/or transfer energies among different ports. The additional electrical ports can be used to increase the power rating, enhance the fault-tolerant capability, and control the motion/power flow. The extended mechanical ports are commonly used to decouple the motion, speeds, and/or torque. The multiport feature opens a new era in traditional electric machinery and provides an effective approach to the application-oriented design of new energy conversion systems. Though relatively young, they have experienced rapid developments in terms of available topologies, analysis and design techniques, and control strategies in a wide range of applications, such as electric vehicle/hybrid electric vehicles, high power industrial drives, rail transportation, wind turbine systems, ac&#8211;dc microgrids, more electric aircrafts, and so on, during the past decades.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Thermal error in machine tools arises from error in positioning the tool due to thermal distortion of the machine structure. Thermal error can be effectively reduced by implementing a compensation algorithm into the machine control loop. The compensation algorithm is derived from a disturbance model or mathematical representation of the thermal error. In this paper, thermal error in a spindle motor assembly is predicted from temperature measurement through the disturbance model. Model reduction technique is applied to eliminate the temperature sensor, which has least effect on the model output (thermal error). Applying the sensor selection method resulted in a reduced number of temperature sensors (10 to 4) required to achieve the same model prediction accuracy. In the final experiment, the spindle motor is subjected to a 5-h cyclical heat load and the maximum prediction accuracy achieved using the reduced set sensors is 1.5$mu$m (time averaged accuracy of 0.77 $mu$m).

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The sharp fluctuations of load consumption and renewable power generation make significant risks in microgrids (MG) planning problem. In order to handle the risk, this paper proposes an innovative risk-based bilevel model for optimal planning of MGs under uncertainty. Furthermore, two different risk neutral and risk averse strategies are defined for MGs operator to investigate the impact of risk strategies on the MG planning problem. The proposed problem has been formulated as stochastic bilevel model, where the optimal planning of distributed energy resource accomplishes in the upper level and optimum switch allocation problem for partitioning traditional distribution system into a number of MGs carries out in the lower level. The partitioning traditional distribution system into interconnected MGs is implemented considering economic, technical, reliability, and maximum supply security aspects. Cuckoo optimization algorithm and imperialist competitive algorithm are applied to minimize the objective functions of upper and lower levels, respectively. The simulation study is performed on the PG&amp;E 69-bus distribution system and the consequent discussions demonstrate the adequacy and efficiency of the proposed methodology.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A concurrent optimum design of a manipulator is to find the best geometrical and control parameters in the same optimization process. One of the main contributions of this paper is a concurrent method for optimum design and its comparison versus a sequential one, where the later requires several optimization stages. Besides, we statistically compare three metaheuristics: the Omnioptimizer, the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy, and the Boltzmann univariate marginal distribution algorithm for the two methodologies, in order to elucidate directions about which metaheuristic performs the best for this kind of problem, and whether it must be used in a sequential or concurrent fashion. These metaheuristics are compared with reported results in the specialized literature. In addition, we perform an analysis of results to statistically determine relations between the parameters and the objective function, as a consequence, we found the most impacting parameters to the manipulator performance.
