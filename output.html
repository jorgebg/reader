<p>I crossed paths with Peter Sands at the World Health Assembly last week. I greeted him warmly, I thought, and asked how he was settling into his new role as Executive Director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. He looked uncomfortable. His manner was frosty, possibly even icy. Our conversation, such as it was, faltered. We parted awkwardly. I understand why. After we published a laudatory welcome following his appointment, we criticised the Global Fund's partnership with drinks manufacturer, Heineken&#8212;a partnership endorsed by Peter himself.

It's not, of course, that ageing has no significance for men. But for women, it passes to a different rhythm: the monthly thrum of ovulation and menstruation, the fear of a missed period that might shut down one future, the insistent reminders that time is running out&#8212;time to conceive, time to decide, time before crossing into the realm of the Older Women, invisible and disdained in a culture that values women only when they're too young to be powerful.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Hardware Trojan detection has emerged as a critical challenge to ensure security and trustworthiness of integrated circuits. A vast majority of research efforts in this area has utilized side-channel analysis for Trojan detection. Functional test generation for logic testing is a promising alternative but it may not be helpful if a Trojan cannot be fully activated or the Trojan effect cannot be propagated to the observable outputs. Side-channel analysis, on the other hand, can achieve significantly higher detection coverage for Trojans of all types/sizes, since it does not require activation/propagation of an unknown Trojan. However, they have often limited effectiveness due to poor detection sensitivity under large process variations and small Trojan footprint in side-channel signature. In this paper, we address this critical problem through a novel side-channel-aware test generation approach, based on a concept of multiple excitation of rare switching (MERS), that can significantly increase Trojan detection sensitivity. This paper makes several important contributions: 1) it presents in detail a scalable statistical test generation method, which can generate high-quality test set for creating high relative activity in arbitrary Trojan instances; 2) it analyzes the effectiveness of generated test set in terms of Trojan coverage; and 3) it describes two judicious reordering methods that can further tune the test set and greatly improve the side channel sensitivity. Simulation results demonstrate that the tests generated by MERS can significantly increase the Trojans sensitivity, thereby making Trojan detection effective using side-channel analysis.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Distinguishing between natural images (NIs) and computer-generated (CG) images by naked human eyes is difficult. In this paper, we propose an effective method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) for this fundamental image forensic problem. Having observed the rather limited performance of training existing CCNs from scratch or fine-tuning pre-trained network, we design and implement a new and appropriate network with two cascaded convolutional layers at the bottom of a CNN. Our network can be easily adjusted to accommodate different sizes of input image patches while maintaining a fixed depth, a stable structure of CNN, and a good forensic performance. Considering the complexity of training CNNs and the specific requirement of image forensics, we introduce the so-called local-to-global strategy in our proposed network. Our CNN derives a forensic decision on local patches, and a global decision on a full-sized image can be easily obtained via simple majority voting. This strategy can also be used to improve the performance of existing methods that are based on hand-crafted features. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods, especially in a challenging forensic scenario with NIs and CG images of heterogeneous origins. Our method also has good robustness against typical post-processing operations, such as resizing and JPEG compression. Unlike previous attempts to use CNNs for image forensics, we try to understand what our CNN has learned about the differences between NIs and CG images with the aid of adequate and advanced visualization tools.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The key-leakage-storage region is derived for a generalization of a classic two-terminal key agreement model. The additions to the model are that the encoder observes a hidden, or noisy, version of the identifier, and that the encoder and decoder can perform multiple measurements. To illustrate the behavior of the region, the theory is applied to binary identifiers and noise modeled via binary symmetric channels. In particular, the key-leakage-storage region is simplified by applying Mrs. Gerber&#x2019;s lemma twice in different directions to a Markov chain. The growth in the region as the number of measurements increases is quantified. The amount by which the privacy-leakage rate reduces for a hidden identifier as compared to a noise-free (visible) identifier at the encoder is also given. If the encoder incorrectly models the source as visible, it is shown that substantial secrecy leakage may occur and the reliability of the reconstructed key might decrease.

Traditional iris recognition methods cannot achieve high identification rate using these low-quality images. To enhance the performance of mobile identification, we develop a deep feature fusion network that exploits the complementary information presented in iris and periocular regions. The proposed method first applies maxout units into the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to generate a compact representation for each modality and then fuses the discriminative features of two modalities through a weighted concatenation. The parameters of convolutional filters and fusion weights are simultaneously learned to optimize the joint representation of iris and periocular biometrics. To promote the iris recognition research on mobile devices under near-infrared (NIR) illumination, we publicly release the CASIA-Iris-Mobile-V1.0 database, which in total includes 11 000 NIR iris images of both eyes from 630 Asians. It is the largest NIR mobile iris database as far as we know. On the newly built CASIA-Iris-M1-S3 data set, the proposed method achieves 0.60&#x0025; equal error rate and 2.32&#x0025; false non-match rate at false match rate  $=10^{-5}$ , which are obviously better than unimodal biometrics as well as traditional fusion methods. Moreover, the proposed model requires much fewer storage spaces and computational resources than general CNNs.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In a recent publication in this journal, K. Bu et al. (IEEE Trans. on Information Forensics and Security, vol. 8, no. 3, pp. 429&#x2013;439, Mar. 2013) presented a protocol that detects cloned tags (replicas of genuine tags) in anonymous radio frequency identification (RFID) systems by leveraging unreconciled collisions in the medium access control layer. This does not require RFID readers to implement cryptographic mechanisms, or know the identities of tags. Improved versions have since been published that claim that detection can also be deterministic. In this paper, we analyze this protocol and show that the physical limitations of collision detection have not been adequately addressed and that, without any further assumptions, unreconcilable collisions cannot be detected. We then propose a solution for which the responses of tags are randomized and show that: 1) there is a tradeoff between the accuracy of detecting cloning attacks and execution time and 2) detection of cloned tags cannot be deterministic.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Domestic induction cookers are evolving from fixed cooking areas to flexible surfaces in such a way that the pot can be placed at any position. This implies the use of a larger number of reduced-sized inductors, which present a lower efficiency. As a solution to increase the efficiency while maintaining the flexibility, we propose the use of partially overlapped inductors of a larger size. This concept is currently in use in wireless power transfer systems, where the transmitter arrangement consists of several overlapped coils. The aim of this paper is to evaluate this concept applied to domestic induction heating appliances, with special emphasis in analyzing the effects of introducing the multicoil system with dissipative media. Moreover, the losses in the winding will be studied in detail. The system will be prototyped and tested, delivering up to 3.7 kW.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel nonisolated single-input dual-output three-level dc&#x2013;dc converter (SIDO-TLC) appropriate for medium- and high-voltage applications. The SIDO-TLC is an integration of the three-level buck and boost converters, whose output voltages are regulated simultaneously. Reducing voltage stress across semiconductor devices, improving efficiency, and reducing inductors size are among the main merits of the new topology. Moreover, due to the considerably reduced volume of the step-down filter capacitor, a small film capacitor can be used instead, whose advantages are lower equivalent series resistance and a longer lifespan. A closed-loop control system has been designed based on a small-signal model derivation in order to regulate the output voltages along with the capacitors&#x2019; voltage balancing. In order to verify the theoretical and simulation results, a 300-W prototype was built and experimented. The results prove the aforementioned advantages of the SIDO-TLC, and the high effectiveness of the balancing control strategy. Furthermore, the converter shows very good stability, even under simultaneous step changes of the loads and input voltage.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>For parameter identifications of robot systems, most existing works have focused on the estimation veracity, but few works of literature are concerned with the convergence speed. In this paper, we developed a robot control/identification scheme to identify the unknown robot kinematic and dynamic parameters with enhanced convergence rate. Superior to the traditional methods, the information of parameter estimation error was properly integrated into the proposed identification algorithm, such that enhanced estimation performance was achieved. Besides, the Newton&#x2013;Euler (NE) method was used to build the robot dynamic model, where a singular value decomposition-based model reduction method was designed to remedy the potential singularity problems of the NE regressor. Moreover, an interval excitation condition was employed to relax the requirement of persistent excitation condition for the kinematic estimation. By using the Lyapunov synthesis, explicit analysis of the convergence rate of the tracking errors and the estimated parameters were performed. Simulation studies were conducted to show the accurate and fast convergence of the proposed finite-time (FT) identification algorithm based on a 7-DOF arm of Baxter robot.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper addresses the mean-square finite-time bounded control problem for uncertain stochastic systems via a sliding mode approach. The stochastic phenomena of randomly occurring uncertainties and randomly varying actuator faults modeled by two independent exponential distributions are addressed effectively. A key issue for the system under the consideration is how to ensure, for any prescribed finite (possibly short) working time interval, the stochastic finite-time boundedness (SFTB) of the resultant closed-loop systems and the reachability of the specified sliding surface in mean-square sense. To this end, a parameter-dependent sliding mode control (SMC) law is designed to force (with probability one) the state trajectories into a domain around the specified sliding surface during the given finite-time interval. The upper bound of the sliding domain associated with the design parameters is obtained explicitly. The sufficient conditions are established, respectively, for guaranteeing the SFTB of the SMC systems over both reaching phase and sliding motion phase. Finally, the proposed finite-time SMC approach is illustrated via a parallel active suspension system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a three-level quasi-switched boost T-type inverter (3L qSBT<sup>2</sup>I) is proposed. A new pulse-width modulated (PWM) control method is presented to reduce the inductor current ripple of the qSBT<sup>2</sup> I. In the introduced PWM technique, the shoot-through duty cycle is maintained constant to keep the modulation index as high as possible. Then, the only control parameters of the qSBT<sup>2</sup>I are the duty cycles of the two additional switches. By controlling the duty cycles of the two additional switches, the voltage gain of the proposed qSBT<sup>2 </sup>I can be improved to a value larger than that of the conventional 3L impedance source inverters. The steady-state analysis, operating principles, and comparisons with the impedance source-based 3L inverters are presented. A 1-kW prototype is constructed to verify the operating principle of the 3L qSBT<sup>2</sup>I. An indirect dc-link voltage regulator and a capacitor voltage-balance controller are applied to the proposed qSBT<sup>2</sup>I. Simulation and experimental results are presented.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The electricity load data recorded by smart meters contain plenty of knowledge that contributes to obtaining load patterns and consumer categories. Generally, the daily load curves are clustered first in order to obtain load patterns of each consumer. However, due to the volume and high dimensions of load curves, existing clustering algorithms are not appropriate in this situation. Thus, a fused load curve clustering algorithm based on wavelet transform (FCCWT) is proposed to solve this problem. The algorithm includes two main phases. First, FCCWT applies multilevel discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to convert the daily load curves for dimensionality reduction. Second, it detects clusters at two outputs of the first phase, and then fuses two groups of clusters with a sub-algorithm named cluster fusion to achieve the optimized clusters. FCCWT is implemented on datasets of both China and United States. Their clustering performances are evaluated by diverse validity indices comparing with four typical clustering methods. The experimental results show that FCCWT outperforms other comparison methods. Additionally, case analysis of two datasets are also provided to discuss the significance of load patterns.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel decentralized coordinated voltage control (CVC) scheme for a distribution system consisting of dc microgrid (DCMG), doubly fed induction generator-based wind system, on-load tap changer (OLTC), and DSTATCOM. The proposed scheme considers the response time of various voltage regulating devices and assigns a master/slave role based on the operating conditions of the grid and availability of the device. This paper offers a distinctive solution to optimally utilize the voltage regulating devices which do not take part in the contingency situation such as OLTC and DCMG converter in order to achieve the following objectives: 1) A better voltage regulation and increased reactive power reserve during normal operating conditions of the grid. 2) To improve the transient performance of the system in terms of reduction in postfault voltage recovery time. Two modified IEEE 33 bus systems are implemented in a real-time digital simulator platform to test the effectiveness of the proposed CVC scheme. Furthermore, power hardware in loop (PHIL) experimentation is conducted with a reduced scale DCMG hardware setup to test the stability, feasibility, and practicability of the proposed scheme. The simulation and PHIL results demonstrate that the proposed CVC scheme provides a better solution compared to existing work by fulfilling the set objectives.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>High-dimensional and sparse (HiDS) matrices are commonly encountered in many big-data-related and industrial applications like recommender systems. When acquiring useful patterns from them, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) models have proven to be highly effective owing to their fine representativeness of the nonnegative data. However, current NMF techniques suffer from: 1) inefficiency in addressing HiDS matrices; and 2) constraints in their training schemes. To address these issues, this paper proposes to extract nonnegative latent factors (NLFs) from HiDS matrices via a novel inherently NLF (INLF) model. It bridges the output factors and decision variables via a single-element-dependent mapping function, thereby making the parameter training unconstrained and compatible with general training schemes on the premise of maintaining the nonnegativity constraints. Experimental results on six HiDS matrices arising from industrial applications indicate that INLF is able to acquire NLFs from them more efficiently than any existing method does.

<p>Smart manufacturing is increasingly becoming the common goal of various national strategies. Smart interconnection is one of the most important issues for implementing smart manufacturing. However, current solutions are not tended to realize smart interconnection in dealing with heterogeneous equipment, quick configuration and implementation, and online service generation. To solve the issues, industrial Internet-of-Things hub (IIHub) is proposed, which consists of customized access module (CA-Module), access hub (A-Hub), and local service pool (LSP). A set of flexible CA-Modules can be configured or programed to connect heterogeneous physical manufacturing resources. Besides, the IIHub supports manufacturing services online generation based on the service encapsulation templates and also supports quick configuration and implementation for smart interconnection. Furthermore, related smart analysis and precise management have the potential to be achieved. Finally, a prototype is given to illustrate the functions of the proposed IIHub, and to show how IIHub realizes smart interconnection.

<p>In wake-up radio (WuR) enabled wireless sensor networks (WSNs), a node triggers a data communication at any time instant by sending a wake-up call (WuC) in an on-demand manner. Such wake-up operations eliminate idle listening and overhearing burden for energy consumption in duty-cycled WSNs. Although WuR exhibits its superiority for light traffic, it is inefficient to handle high traffic load in a network. This paper makes an effort towards improving the performance of WuR under diverse load conditions with a twofold contribution. We first propose three protocols that support variable traffic loads by enabling respectively clear channel assessment (CCA), backoff plus CCA, and adaptive WuC transmissions. These protocols provide various options for achieving reliable data transmission, low latency, and energy efficiency for ultralow power consumption applications. Then, we develop an analytical framework based on an M/G/1/2 queue to evaluate the performance of these WuR protocols. Discrete-event simulations validate the accuracy of the analytical models.
