<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The bloom of the fifth generation (5G) communication and beyond serves as a
catalyst for physical layer key generation techniques. In 5G communications
systems, many challenges in traditional physical layer key generation schemes,
such as co-located eavesdroppers, the high bit disagreement ratio, and high
temporal correlation, could be overcome. This paper lists the key-enabler
techniques in 5G wireless networks, which offer opportunities to address
existing issues in physical layer key generation. We survey the existing key
generation methods and introduce possible solutions for the existing issues.
The new solutions include applying the high signal directionality in
beamforming to resist co-located eavesdroppers, utilizing the sparsity of
millimeter wave (mmWave) channel to achieve a low bit disagreement ratio under
low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), and exploiting hybrid precoding to reduce the
temporal correlation among measured samples. Finally, the future trends of
physical layer key generation in 5G and beyond communications are discussed.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To defeat security threats such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks,
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 4.2 and 5.x introduce the Secure Connections Only
mode, under which a BLE device accepts only secure paring protocols including
Passkey Entry and Numeric Comparison from an initiator, e.g., an Android
mobile. However, the BLE specification does not explicitly require the Secure
Connection Only mode of the initiator. Taking the Android's BLE programming
framework for example, we found that it cannot enforce secure pairing,
invalidating the security protection provided by the Secure Connection Only
mode. The same problem applies to Apple iOS too.
</p>
<p>Specifically, we examine the life cycle of a BLE pairing process in Android
and identify four severe design flaws. These design flaws can be exploited by
attackers to perform downgrading attacks, forcing the BLE pairing protocols to
run in the insecure mode without the users' awareness. To validate our
findings, we selected and tested 18 popular BLE commercial products and our
experimental results proved that downgrading attacks and MITM attacks were all
possible to these products. All 3501 BLE apps from Androzoo are also subject to
these attacks. For defense, we have designed and implemented a prototype of the
Secure Connection Only mode on Android 8 through the Android Open Source
Project (AOSP). We have reported the identified BLE pairing vulnerabilities to
Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), Google, Apple, Texas Instruments (TI)
and all of them are actively addressing this issue. Google rated the reported
security flaw a High Severity.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recently, a special type of data poisoning (DP) attack targeting Deep Neural
Network (DNN) classifiers, known as a backdoor, was proposed. These attacks do
not seek to degrade classification accuracy, but rather to have the classifier
learn to classify to a target class whenever the backdoor pattern is present in
a test example. Launching backdoor attacks does not require knowledge of the
classifier or its training process - it only needs the ability to poison the
training set with (a sufficient number of) exemplars containing a sufficiently
strong backdoor pattern (labeled with the target class). Here we address
post-training detection of backdoor attacks in DNN image classifiers, seldom
considered in existing works, wherein the defender does not have access to the
poisoned training set, but only to the trained classifier itself, as well as to
clean examples from the classification domain. This is an important scenario
because a trained classifier may be the basis of e.g. a phone app that will be
shared with many users. Detecting backdoors post-training may thus reveal a
widespread attack. We propose a purely unsupervised anomaly detection (AD)
defense against imperceptible backdoor attacks that: i) detects whether the
trained DNN has been backdoor-attacked; ii) infers the source and target
classes involved in a detected attack; iii) we even demonstrate it is possible
to accurately estimate the backdoor pattern. We test our AD approach, in
comparison with alternative defenses, for several backdoor patterns, data sets,
and attack settings and demonstrate its favorability. Our defense essentially
requires setting a single hyperparameter (the detection threshold), which can
e.g. be chosen to fix the system's false positive rate.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The Sampled Gaussian Mechanism (SGM)---a composition of subsampling and the
additive Gaussian noise---has been successfully used in a number of machine
learning applications. The mechanism's unexpected power is derived from privacy
amplification by sampling where the privacy cost of a single evaluation
diminishes quadratically, rather than linearly, with the sampling rate.
Characterizing the precise privacy properties of SGM motivated development of
several relaxations of the notion of differential privacy.

<p>Performing deep learning on end-user devices provides fast offline inference
results and can help protect the user's privacy. However, running models on
untrusted client devices reveals model information which may be proprietary,

manipulated to copy and redistribute this information, infringing on the model

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In Reply Dr Yang and colleagues highlight some of the key challenges facing the field of biomarker discovery in general and in particular with the use of PD-L1 metrics to predict immunotherapy response in NSCLC. We agree that there are numerous challenges to interpreting PD-L1 pathological data, including the antibody clone used, intensity of staining, heterogeneity of expression within the tumor, and changes in expression over time and with interval treatments. Ultimately, controlling for all of these variables, even in the context of a clinical trial (eg, requiring evaluation of PD-L1 status from multiple biopsy sites), is very challenging and further highlights the importance of exploring these data in a real-world data set where community clinical practice precludes optimization of all of these parameters. Nevertheless, as noted in the Methods section of the article, we defined positive and negative PD-L1 results using previously published standards, including a requirement of 50% staining in a central laboratory using the 22C3 or SP142 antibodies, or annotation in the medical record of a positive result. Cases that did not adhere to these guidelines were excluded.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In order to overcome the shortcomings of the measurement methods for gas cumulative flow, especially in the long-term continuous measurement, a novel memristor-based gas cumulative flow sensor is proposed in this paper. The sensor is mainly composed of a hot-wire resistor, the memristor module, a feedback compensation network and some basic circuit components. According to the thermal balance equation and the memory characteristics of memristor, the sensor can measure the gas cumulative flow by combining the memristor resistance with the cross-sectional area of the pipe. In order to verify the design of memristor-based gas accumulation flow sensor, experiments are carried out under a constant gas flow velocity, a gradually increasing flow velocity, and a randomly varying flow velocity. The active region thickness D of the selected TiO2/TiO<sub>2-n</sub> memristor is 40 nm. The hot-wire used is a tungsten wire having a radius of 10 &#x03bc;m and a length of 2 mm. The gas measured is air at a temperature of 300 K in the paper. The experimental results show that the sensor achieves the measurement of gas cumulative flow. When gas flow velocity at the center of the pipe is 5 m/s, the measuring range is approximately 0-20 m<sup>3</sup> and the sensitivity within the effective range is approximately 28.44 &#x03a9;/m<sup>3</sup>. When the gas flow velocity, the memristor pairs increase and the gain of the amplifier changes, the measuring range, and the sensitivity of the sensor will changes accordingly.

A thermoelectric generator is used to harvest the thermal energy produced by the PA and transform it into electric energy. Then, the efficiency of the PA can be improved by feeding the obtained electric energy to the drain power supply via a dc-dc converter. For verification, a 10-W 3.2-3.8-GHz class-F PA for base station applications is built; the generated temperature distribution and the process of energy conversion are evaluated. Cost-effective commercial chips are applied to harvest, transform, convert, and feedback the energies to the drain supply.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Thanks to the advantages of high power density and the capacity of bidirectional power transfer, the CLLC resonant converter is widely used in the hybrid ac-dc microgrid as a dc transformer to interlink the ac and dc bus. Since the voltages of ac and dc bus are controlled by the energy management system, the CLLC resonant converter operates under open-loop condition, which means the switching frequency and duty cycle are fixed. As a result, in the hybrid ac-dc microgrid applications, for the CLLC converter, the main concern is not the voltage regulation but the conversion efficiency. This paper focuses on the total power loss optimization and the magnetic design of the CLLC resonant converter based on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm. In order to optimize the total power loss, an AI algorithm-based two-stage optimal design method is proposed. In the first stage, the total power loss, including the driving loss, turn-off loss, conduction loss of the switches, the power loss of the resonant capacitances, and copper and core loss of the transformer are optimized by the proposed AI algorithm, GA+PSO, and the optimal parameters, including the leakage inductances (L<sub>r1</sub> and L<sub>r2</sub>), magnetizing inductance (L<sub>m</sub>), and resonant capacitances (C<sub>r1</sub> and C<sub>r2</sub>) are derived. In the second stage, the optimal leakage inductances and magnetizing inductance are realized by setting proper distance between the primary winding and the secondary winding (d<sub>w</sub>), and the thickness of the air gap (d<sub>a</sub>). As for the magnetic design, in this paper, the leakage inductances of a planar transformer are used as the resonant inductances. The equations of dw and da to achieve the optimal leakage inductances and magnetizing inductance are derived. Both the proposed optimal design method and the equations of dw and da are validated by simulations and experiments.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A significant portion (ca. 40%) of the world's total energy is utilized in buildings. Cooling of large buildings worldwide is done by centrifugal chiller systems, where the compressors, pumps, and fans are driven by ac motors. These motors are energy hungry parts of the chiller. All-variable speed chillers, taking into account load variations, reduced the energy demand significantly compared to the constant speed ones. Induction motors (IMs) are commonly used in modern chillers. However, as the efficiency of the IM decreases with the speed, the overall efficiency drops, as the chiller operates most of the time in part-load condition. In this paper, SimulationX software is used to quantitatively investigate about the energy efficiency improvement by using synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) in all-variable speed centrifugal chillers. The system was tested for three distinct building load profiles. The results are judged in comparison with the state-of-the-art IE2 IMs. The results provide quantitative evidence that SynRM can significantly increase the energy efficiency in the chiller systems and has a big potential to substitute IMs in these applications.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel sensor-less switching method based on logic gates for a five-level packed U-cell (PUC5) converter. It comprises only two level-shifted triangular carriers and logic gates. Hence, the number of triangular carriers is halved and the switching states table is eliminated, which cause remarkable reduction in complexity of the proposed modulation method. Moreover, employing the proposed sensor-less switching method leads to decrease in the PUC5 capacitor value by a factor of carrier ratio, fast self-balancing of the PUC5 capacitor voltage, and halving the output LC filter inductor and capacitor values in stand-alone mode, as well as the grid-link inductor value in grid-connected mode. In addition, the PUC5 converter start-up transient time is considerably decreased and the first switching harmonic cluster frequency is doubled, which lead to notable improvement of steady-state and dynamic performances of the PUC5 converter. The proposed sensor-less switching method has been implemented in both stand-alone and grid-connected operating modes of PUC5 converter. Provided simulation and experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed sensor-less switching method as well as its improved dynamic and steady-state performances in both stand-alone and grid-connected modes.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Participatory sensing is a crowdsourcing-based framework, where the platform executes the sensing requests with the help of many common peoples' handheld devices (typically smartphones). In this paper, we mainly address the online sensing request admission and smartphone selection problem to maximize the profit of the platform, taking into account the queue backlog, and the location of sensing requests and smartphones. First, we formulate this problem as a discrete time model and design a location aware online admission and selection control algorithm (LAAS) based on the Lyapunov optimization technique. The LAAS algorithm only depends on the currently available information and makes all the control decisions independently and simultaneously. Next, we utilize the recent advancement of the accurate prediction of smartphones' mobility and sensing request arrival information in the next few time slots and develop a predictive location aware admission and selection control algorithm (PLAAS). We further design a greedy predictive location aware admission and selection control algorithm (GPLAAS) to achieve the online implementation of PLAAS approximately and iteratively. Theoretical analysis shows that under any control parameter V &gt; 0, both LAAS and PLAAS algorithm can achieve O(1/V)-optimal average profit, while the sensing request backlog is bounded by O(V). Extensive numerical results based on both synthetic and real trace show that LAAS outperforms the Greedy algorithm and Random algorithm and GPLAAS improves the profit-backlog tradeoff over LAAS.

<p>One of the basic tenets of evidence-based medicine is that randomisation is crucial to understanding treatment effects. Observational studies are subject to confounding and selection bias. Researchers can adjust for measured differences between treatment groups, but unmeasured or unmeasurable differences might exist between groups that obscure true treatment effects and cannot be accounted for by any statistical method.1 The published medical literature is filled with examples of associations between treatment and outcome identified in observational studies that were subsequently disproven by well conducted randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Public cloud offers economy of scale to adapt workload changes in an autonomic manner, maximizing the use of resources. Through network function virtualization (NFV), network operators can move LTE core to the cloud; hence removing their dependency on carrier-grade LTE network functions. Recent research efforts discuss performance, latency, and fault tolerance of LTE NFV, largely ignoring the security aspects. In this paper, we discover new vulnerabilities that LTE NFV face today with no standard solutions to address them. These vulnerabilities span at both LTE control and user planes. To address them, we propose vEPC-sec that cryptographically secures LTE control-plane signaling messages in the cloud. It provides distributed key management and key derivation schemes to derive shared-symmetric keys for securing the communication between any two network functions. Our approach provides encryption and integrity protection to the messages even during virtual machines scalability and failure recovery scenarios. vEPC-sec also prevents user-plane vulnerabilities by ensuring that LTE routing modules should faithfully forward the LTE subscriber packets.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based pedestrian detection methods have proven to be successful in various applications, detecting small-scale pedestrians from surveillance images is still challenging. The major reason is that the small-scale pedestrians lack much detailed information compared to the large-scale pedestrians. To solve this problem, we propose to utilize the relationship between the large-scale pedestrians and the corresponding small-scale pedestrians to help recover the detailed information of the small-scale pedestrians, thus improving the performance of detecting small-scale pedestrians. Specifically, a unified network (called JCS-Net) is proposed for small-scale pedestrian detection, which integrates the classification task and the super-resolution task in a unified framework. As a result, the super-resolution and classification are fully engaged, and the super-resolution sub-network can recover some useful detailed information for the subsequent classification. Based on HOG&#x002b;LUV and JCS-Net, multi-layer channel features (MCF) are constructed to train the detector. The experimental results on the Caltech pedestrian dataset and the KITTI benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further enhance the detection, multi-scale MCF based on JCS-Net for pedestrian detection is also proposed, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a self-guiding multimodal LSTM (sgLSTM) image captioning model is proposed to handle an uncontrolled imbalanced real-world image-sentence dataset. We collect a FlickrNYC dataset from Flickr as our testbed with 306,165 images and the original text descriptions uploaded by the users are utilized as the ground truth for training. Descriptions in the FlickrNYC dataset vary dramatically ranging from short term-descriptions to long paragraph-descriptions and can describe any visual aspects, or even refer to objects that are not depicted. To deal with the imbalanced and noisy situation and to fully explore the dataset itself, we propose a novel guiding textual feature extracted utilizing a multimodal LSTM (mLSTM) model. Training of mLSTM is based on the portion of data in which the image content and the corresponding descriptions are strongly bonded. Afterward, during the training of sgLSTM on the rest training data, this guiding information serves as additional input to the network along with the image representations and the ground-truth descriptions. By integrating these input components into a multimodal block, we aim to form a training scheme with the textual information tightly coupled with the image content. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed sgLSTM model outperforms the traditional state-of-the-art multimodal RNN captioning framework in successfully describing the key components of the input images.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A fully-parallelized work-time optimal algorithm is presented for computing the exact Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) of a 2D binary image with the size of  $ntimes n$ . Unlike existing PRAM (Parallel Random Access Machine) and other algorithms, this algorithm is suitable for implementation on modern SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) architectures such as GPUs. As a fundamental operation of 2D EDT, 1D EDT is efficiently parallelized first. Specifically, the GPU algorithm for the 1D EDT, which uses CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) binary functions, such as ballot(), ffs(), clz(), and shfl(), runs in  $O(log_{32}n)$  time and performs  $O(n)$  work. Using the 1D EDT as a fundamental operation, the fully-parallelized work-time optimal 2D EDT algorithm is designed. This algorithm consists of three steps. Step 1 of the algorithm runs in  $O(log_{32}n)$  time and performs  $O(N)$  ( $N = n^{2}$ ) of total work on GPU. Step 2 performs  $O(N)$  of total work and has an expected time complexity of  $O(logn)$  on GPU. Step 3 runs in  $O(log_{32}n)$  time and performs  $O(N)$  of total work on GPU. As far as we know, this algorithm is the first fully-parallelized and realized work-time optimal algorithm for GPUs. The experimental results show that this algorit-
m outperforms the prior state-of-the-art GPU algorithms.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Sonar imagery plays a significant role in oceanic applications since there is little natural light underwater, and light is irrelevant to sonar imaging. Sonar images are very likely to be affected by various distortions during the process of transmission via the underwater acoustic channel for further analysis. At the receiving end, the reference image is unavailable due to the complex and changing underwater environment and our unfamiliarity with it. To the best of our knowledge, one of the important usages of sonar images is target recognition on the basis of contour information. The contour degradation degree for a sonar image is relevant to the distortions contained in it. To this end, we developed a new no-reference contour degradation measurement for perceiving the quality of sonar images. The sparsities of a series of transform coefficient matrices, which are descriptive of contour information, are first extracted as features from the frequency and spatial domains. The contour degradation degree for a sonar image is then measured by calculating the ratios of extracted features before and after filtering this sonar image. Finally, a bootstrap aggregating (bagging)-based support vector regression module is learned to capture the relationship between the contour degradation degree and the sonar image quality. The results of experiments validate that the proposed metric is competitive with the state-of-the-art reference-based quality metrics and outperforms the latest reference-free competitors.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We present a deep architecture and learning framework for establishing correspondences across cross-spectral visible and infrared images in an unpaired setting. To overcome the unpaired cross-spectral data problem, we design the unified image translation and feature extraction modules to be learned in a joint and boosting manner. Concretely, the image translation module is learned only with the unpaired cross-spectral data, and the feature extraction module is learned with an input image and its translated image. By learning two modules simultaneously, the image translation module generates the translated image that preserves not only the domain-specific attributes with separate latent spaces but also the domain-agnostic contents with feature consistency constraint. In an inference phase, the cross-spectral feature similarity is augmented by intra-spectral similarities between the features extracted from the translated images. Experimental results show that this model outperforms the state-of-the-art unpaired image translation methods and cross-spectral feature descriptors on various visible and infrared benchmarks.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Top-down saliency detection aims to highlight the regions of a specific object category, and typically relies on pixel-wise annotated training data. In this paper, we address the high cost of collecting such training data by a weakly supervised approach to object saliency detection, where only image-level labels, indicating the presence or absence of a target object in an image, are available. The proposed framework is composed of two collaborative CNN modules, an image-level classifier and a pixel-level map generator. While the former distinguishes images with objects of interest from the rest, the latter is learned to generate saliency maps by which the images masked by the maps can be better predicted by the former. In addition to the top-down guidance from class labels, the map generator is derived by also exploring other cues, including the background prior, superpixel- and object proposal-based evidence. The background prior is introduced to reduce false positives. Evidence from superpixels helps preserve sharp object boundaries. The clue from object proposals improves the integrity of highlighted objects. These different types of cues greatly regularize the training process and reduces the risk of overfitting, which happens frequently when learning CNN models with few training data. Experiments show that our method achieves superior results, even outperforming fully supervised methods.

<p>The electroencephalography (EEG) method has recently attracted increasing attention in the study of brain activity-based biometric systems because of its simplicity, portability, noninvasiveness, and relatively low cost. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG, most of the existing EEG-based biometric systems require a long duration of signals to achieve high accuracy in individual identification. Besides, the feasibility and stability of these systems have not yet been conclusively reported, since most studies did not perform longitudinal evaluation. In this paper, we proposed a novel EEG-based individual identification method using code-modulated visualevoked potentials (c-VEPs). Specifically, this paper quantitatively compared eight code-modulated stimulation patterns, including six 63-bit (1.05 s at 60-Hz refresh rate) m-sequences (M1-M6) and two spatially combined sequence groups (M&#x00d7;4: M1-M4 and M&#x00d7; 6: M1-M6) in recording the c-VEPs from a group of 25 subjects for individual identification. To further evaluate the influence of inter-session variability, we recorded two data sessions for each individual on different days to measure intra-session and cross-session identification performance. State-of-the-art VEP detection algorithms in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) were employed to construct a template-matching-based identification framework. For intra-session identification, we achieved a 100% correct recognition rate (CRR) using 5.25-s EEG data (average of five trials for M5). For cross-session identification, 99.43% CRR was attained using 10.5-s EEG signals (average of ten trials for M5). These results suggest that the proposed c-VEP based individual identification method is promising for real-world applications.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In cyberspace, evolutionary strategies are commonly used by both attackers and defenders. For example, an attacker's strategy often changes over the course of time, as new vulnerabilities are discovered and/or mitigated. Similarly, a defender's strategy changes over time. These changes may or may not be in direct response to a change in the opponent's strategy. In any case, it is important to have a set of quantitative metrics to characterize and understand the effectiveness of attackers' and defenders' evolutionary strategies, which reflect their cyber agility. Despite its clear importance, few systematic metrics have been developed to quantify the cyber agility of attackers and defenders. In this paper, we propose the first metric framework for measuring cyber agility in terms of the effectiveness of the dynamic evolution of cyber attacks and defenses. The proposed framework is generic and applicable to transform any relevant, quantitative, and/or conventional static security metrics (e.g., false positives and false negatives) into dynamic metrics to capture dynamics of system behaviors. In order to validate the usefulness of the proposed framework, we conduct case studies on measuring the evolution of cyber attacks and defenses using two real-world datasets. We discuss the limitations of the current work and identify future research directions.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The deployment of smart hybrid heat pumps (SHHPs) can introduce considerable benefits to electricity systems via smart switching between electricity and gas while minimizing the total heating cost for each individual customer. In particular, the fully optimized control technology can provide flexible heat that redistributes the heat demand across time for improving the utilization of low-carbon generation and enhancing the overall energy efficiency of the heating system. To this end, an accurate quantification of the preheating is of great importance to characterize the flexible heat. This paper proposes a novel data-driven preheating quantification method to estimate the capability of the heat pump demand shifting and isolate the effect of interventions. Varieties of fine-grained data from a real-world trial are exploited to estimate the baseline heat demand using Bayesian deep learning while jointly considering epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. A comprehensive range of case studies are carried out to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed quantification method, and then, the estimated demand shift is used as an input into the whole-system model to investigate the system implications and quantify the range of benefits of rolling out the SHHPs developed by PassivSystems to the future GB electricity systems.

<p>Obtaining an appropriate model is very crucial to develop an efficient energy management system for the smart home, including photovoltaic (PV) array, plug-in electric vehicle (PEV), home loads, and heat pump (HP). Stochastic modeling methods of smart homes explain random parameters and uncertainties of the aforementioned components. In this paper, a concise yet comprehensive analysis and comparison are presented for these techniques. First, modeling methods are implemented to find appropriate and precise forecasting models for PV, PEV, HP, and home load demand. Then, the accuracy of each model is validated by the real measured data. Finally, the pros and cons of each method are discussed and reviewed. The obtained results show the conditions under which the methods can provide a reliable and accurate description of smart home dynamics.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>At present, the fusion of different unimodal biometrics has attracted increasing attention from researchers, who are dedicated to the practical application of biometrics. In this paper, we explored a multi-biometric algorithm that integrates palmprints and dorsal hand veins (DHV). Palmprint recognition has a rather high accuracy and reliability, and the most significant advantage of DHV recognition is the biopsy (Liveness detection). In order to combine the advantages of both and implement the fusion method, deep learning and graph matching were, respectively, introduced to identify palmprint and DHV. Upon using the deep hashing network (DHN), biometric images can be encoded as 128-bit codes. Then, the Hamming distances were used to represent the similarity of two codes. Biometric graph matching (BGM) can obtain three discriminative features for classification. In order to improve the accuracy of open-set recognition, in multi-modal fusion, the score-level fusion of DHN and BGM was performed and authentication was provided by support vector machine (SVM). Furthermore, based on DHN, all four levels of fusion strategies were used for multi-modal recognition of palmprint and DHV. Evaluation experiments and comprehensive comparisons were conducted on various commonly used datasets, and the promising results were obtained in this case where the equal error rates (EERs) of both palmprint recognition and multi-biometrics equal 0, demonstrating the great superiority of DHN in biometric verification.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With a large number of video surveillance systems installed for the requirement from industrial security, the task of object tracking, which aims to locate objects of interest in videos, is very important. Although numerous tracking algorithms for RGB videos have been developed in the decade, the tracking performance and robustness of these systems may be degraded dramatically when the information from RGB video is unreliable (e.g., poor illumination conditions or very low resolution). To address this issue, this paper presents a new tracking system, which aims to combine the information from RGB and infrared modalities for object tracking. The proposed tracking systems is based on our proposed machine learning model. Particularly, the learning model can alleviate the modality discrepancy issue under the proposed modality consistency constraint from both representation patterns and discriminability, and generate discriminative feature templates for collaborative representations and discrimination in heterogeneous modalities. Experiments on a variety of challenging RGB-infrared videos demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
