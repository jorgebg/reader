<p>In November, 2017, as part of her long-awaited industrial strategy, UK Prime Minister Theresa May committed to raise investment in research and development (R&amp;D) to 2&#183;4% of gross domestic product by 2027. Life sciences featured prominently in the industrial strategy, described as one of the dominant economic sectors in the UK. A new strategic funding agency&#8212;UK Research and Innovation (UKRI)&#8212;was created to oversee the allocation of these funds, bringing seven research councils together in a major shake-up of the UK's funding structure.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Online social networks have now become the most popular platforms for people to share information with others. Along with this, there is a serious threat to individuals&#x2019; privacy. One privacy risk comes from the sharing of co-owned data, i.e., when a user shares a data item that involves multiple users, some users&#x2019; privacy may be compromised, since different users generally have different opinions on who can access the data. How to design a collaborative management mechanism to deal with such a privacy issue has recently attracted much attention. In this paper, we propose a trust-based mechanism to realize collaborative privacy management. Basically, a user decides whether or not to post a data item based on the aggregated opinion of all involved users. The trust values between users are used to weight users&#x2019; opinions, and the values are updated according to users&#x2019; privacy loss. Moreover, the user can make a tradeoff between data sharing and privacy preserving by tuning the parameter of the proposed mechanism. We formulate the selecting of the parameter as a multi-armed bandit problem and apply the upper confidence bound policy to solve the problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the trust-based mechanism can encourage the user to be considerate of others&#x2019; privacy, and the proposed bandit approach can bring the user a high payoff.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a novel method that utilizes feature-level fusion of finger vein (FV) and finger dorsal texture (FDT) images is proposed for human identification. Motivated by Weber&#x2019;s law, we present  $alpha $ -trimmed Weber representation ( $alpha $ -TWR) to enhance the foreground lines (FLs), i.e., vessels underneath skin and line-like texture on skin. The proposed  $alpha $ -TWR is robust to illumination variation, as validated by a basic reflective and transmitted imaging model. Cross section asymmetrical coding (CSAC) is performed to extract features for each pixel. The coding value contains discriminative information on the orientation and internal point location of the FLs. The CSAC values of FV and FDT in each point are abreast in terms of binary representation. Local density weighted matching is developed to obtain the matching score between two feature maps. We experimentally show that the proposed method outperforms other unimodal and multimodal identification methods in terms of equal-error-rate.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Gait recognition is of great importance in the fields of surveillance and forensics to identify human beings since gait is the unique biometric feature that can be perceived efficiently at a distance. However, the accuracy of gait recognition to some extent suffers from both the variation of view angles and the deficient gait templates. On one hand, the existing cross-view methods focus on transforming gait templates among different views, which may accumulate the transformation error in a large variation of view angles. On the other hand, a commonly used gait energy image template loses temporal information of a gait sequence. To address these problems, this paper proposes multi-task generative adversarial networks (MGANs) for learning view-specific feature representations. In order to preserve more temporal information, we also propose a new multi-channel gait template, called period energy image (PEI). Based on the assumption of view angle manifold, the MGANs can leverage adversarial training to extract more discriminative features from gait sequences. Experiments on OU-ISIR, CASIA-B, and USF benchmark data sets indicate that compared with several recently published approaches, PEI &#x002b; MGANs achieves competitive performance and is more interpretable to cross-view gait recognition.

<p>This paper considers a two-way relay network, in which two sources exchange data through a relay and a cooperative jammer transmits an artificial noise (AN) while a number of nearby eavesdroppers overhear to recover data from both sources. The relay harvests energy from the two source signals and the AN, and then, uses this harvested energy to forward the received signals to the two sources. Each source eliminates its own signal from the relaying signal by self-cancellation and then decodes the data signal received from the other source. For this wireless-powered two-way relay system, we propose two secure relay protocols based on power splitting and time switching techniques. The two protocols are power splitting-based two-way relaying (PS-TWR) and time switching-based two-way relaying (TS-TWR), in which the relay, respectively, controls the power splitting ratio ( $rho $ ) and time switching ratio ( $alpha $ ), in order to achieve a balance between the data receiving and the energy harvesting. The optimal values of  $rho $  and  $alpha $  for each protocol are found analytically to maximize the minimum guaranteed secrecy capacity ( $C_{S}^{mathrm{min}}$ ) considering multiple eavesdroppers in high signal-to-noise ratio environments. Numerical results show that both the PS-TWR and TS-TWR protocols using the optimized values of  $rho $  and  $alpha $  achieve the near-optimal  $C_{S}^{mathrm{min}}$  -
o matter how many eavesdroppers exist anywhere. Comparisons of the two protocols in various scenarios also show that PS-TWR achieves better  $C_{S}^{mathrm{min}}$  than TS-TWR because PS-TWR inherently has a shorter vulnerable time for eavesdropping than TS-TWR.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Sparse-representation-based classification (SRC) has been showing a good performance for face recognition in recent years. But SRC is not good at face recognition with low quality images (e.g., disguised, corrupted, occluded, and so on) which often appear in practical applications. To solve the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel SRC-based method for face recognition with low quality images named sparse low-rank component-based representation (SLCR). In SLCR, we utilize low-rank matrix recovery on the training data set to obtain low-rank components and non-low-rank components, which are used to construct the dictionary. The new dictionary is capable of describing facial features better, especially for low quality face samples. Furthermore, the minimum class-wise reconstruction residual is used as the recognition rule, leading to a substantial improvement on the proposed SLCR&#x2019;s performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark face databases demonstrate that the proposed method is consistently superior to other sparse-representation-based approaches for face recognition with low quality images.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The paper presents the application of delta-connected cascaded H-bridge multilevel static var generator (SVG) under unbalanced compensation currents or unbalanced supply voltages. Clustered balancing control for delta-connected SVG can be realized by injecting a zero-sequence current to the delta loop. But zero-sequence current injection may cause the high peak phase current which may break converter switches. The aim of this paper is to analyze the key factors that affect the maximum output current of the SVG with injecting zero-sequence current and acquire the quantitative relationship among unbalance compensation capability, the unbalance degree of the supply voltage, the initial phase of negative-sequence voltage, the unbalance degree of the compensation current, and the initial phase of negative-sequence current. On this foundation, the valid compensation range of delta-connected SVG under unbalanced conditions is obtained. Furthermore, the compensation characteristic of the negative-sequence current is deduced with the certain supply voltage, and the influence of supply voltage variation on the maximum output current for SVG is also considered with the certain compensation current. Finally, the correctness of the relevant theoretical analysis is verified by simulation and experiment.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A modularized design of an active charge equalizer and a charge equalization algorithm for a Li-ion battery pack are proposed in this paper. The equalizer consists of one module-balancing circuit and M cell-balancing circuits, where M is the number of modules in the battery pack. Each balancing circuit uses an inductor that is placed in a bridge of four bidirectional switches and works as an energy carrier, and uses a cell/module access network that enables energy transfer from one cell/module to another cell or module. The charge equalization between modules can be performed simultaneously with that between cells, so the proposed circuit can significantly reduce the time required to equalize the charges of all cells in the battery pack. The proposed circuit was tested under various charging/discharging conditions for a battery pack composed of four serially connected modules, with four serially connected cells per module. Experimental results show that the proposed circuit and algorithm comprise a good solution to balance a Li-ion battery pack.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper concerns a novel moving coil actuator integrated with a high-performance seat valve for use in digital displacement machines (DDM), which is an emerging fluid power technology that sets strict actuator requirements in order to get a high energy conversion efficiency. Hence, the mechanical switching time must be in the millisecond range and the actuator power consumption must be in range of few tens of watts. The objectives are twofold: First, establish a proof-of-concept for the integrated actuator/valve that relies on several principles and mechanisms new or uncommon in fluid power applications. Second, formulate and validate a transient numerical model describing the actuator/valve. A coupled simulation model is established to predict the switching performance in which transient electromagnetic finite-element-analysis with dynamic remeshing is coupled to a set of ordinary differential equations describing the motion dynamics. In this way, the movement induced hydromechanical fluid forces caused by rapid acceleration of the valve plunger is coupled with the electromagnetic dynamics. The proposed model is compared rigorously against measurements obtained from a series of experiments based on a fully operational valve prototype. Comparisons of, e.g., transient flux density, current, and plunger position, show that the model describes both the actuator and the valve motion very well. Finally, results are presented when testing the prototype valve in fully operational DDM to establish proof-of-concept for the proposed valve concept. The actuator/valve is shown to be capable of rapid switching in less than 4 ms, while only consuming approximately 45 W corresponding to 0.7% of the machine output power.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a nonsmooth composite control design methodology is investigated to tackle the exact tracking control problem for a general class of nonlinear systems with mismatched disturbances. By first introducing a saturated homogeneous disturbance observer to realize a finite-time performance recovery, a simple composite controller is then made feasible by virtue of the nonrecursive synthesis approach. A new feature is that under a less ambitious control objective, namely, semiglobal stability, various nonlinearity growth constraints for nonsmooth design approaches are essentially relaxed. Rigourous proof is provided to demonstrate the theoretical justifications. In order to illustrate the practical nature of the proposed design framework, a practical control application to series elastic actuator is presented. Experimental comparison results with the PID and finite-time controllers show significant performance improvements.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The papers in this special section on emerging multiport electrical machines and systems is to provide an opportunity for researchers and engineers from academia and/or industry, to exchange their enlightening ideas on analysis, design, and control of such new machine breeds, to identify the challenges in practical applications and to present the state-of-the-art solutions. Distinct from the conventional electric machines with only one electrical and one mechanical port, electrical machines featuring multiple electrical/mechanical ports provide a highly efficient, compact, and flexible manner to convert and/or transfer energies among different ports. The additional electrical ports can be used to increase the power rating, enhance the fault-tolerant capability, and control the motion/power flow. The extended mechanical ports are commonly used to decouple the motion, speeds, and/or torque. The multiport feature opens a new era in traditional electric machinery and provides an effective approach to the application-oriented design of new energy conversion systems. Though relatively young, they have experienced rapid developments in terms of available topologies, analysis and design techniques, and control strategies in a wide range of applications, such as electric vehicle/hybrid electric vehicles, high power industrial drives, rail transportation, wind turbine systems, ac&#8211;dc microgrids, more electric aircrafts, and so on, during the past decades.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Rising energy costs, losses in the present-day electricity grid, risks from nuclear power generation, and global environmental changes are motivating a transformation of the conventional ways of generating electricity. Globally, there is a desire to rely more on renewable energy resources (RERs) for electricity generation. RERs reduce greenhouse gas emissions and may have economic benefits, e.g., through applying demand side management with dynamic pricing so as to shift loads from fossil fuel-based generators to RERs. The electricity grid is presently evolving toward an intelligent grid, the so-called smart grid (SG). One of the major goals of the future SG is to move toward 100% electricity generation from RERs, i.e., toward a 100% renewable grid. However, the disparate, intermittent, and typically widely geographically distributed nature of RERs complicates the integration of RERs into the SG. Moreover, individual RERs have generally lower capacity than conventional fossil fuel-based plants, and these RERs are based on a wide spectrum of different technologies. In this article, we give an overview of recent efforts that aim to integrate RERs into the SG. We outline the integration of RERs into the SG along with their supporting communication networks. We also discuss ongoing projects that seek to integrate RERs into the SG around the globe. Finally, we outline future research directions on integrating RERs into the SG.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Solution of optimization problems is inseparable part of science and engineering. The close dependence of industry applications on science and engineering clarifies need to optimization algorithms for modern industries. In this paper, the proposition of an evolutionary optimization algorithm is presented. The proposed algorithm is inspired from wild goats' climbing. The living in the groups and cooperation between members of groups are main ideas which have been inspired. Along the procedure of the algorithm, leaders of groups attract group's other members and eventually the leader of the biggest group reaches the highest point of mountain. Besides examining with a number of benchmark functions, the performance of the algorithm is gone through by one of the energy systems' important problems, which is known as combined heat and power economic dispatch (CHPED) problem. The aim of the CHPED problem is supplying power and heat demand in an economical manner by conventional thermal units, CHP units, and heat-only units. The effect of valve-point and transmission losses is taken into account in order to consider practical CHPED model. The algorithm is tested on three test systems and the results show the ability of the algorithm to converge the optimum values.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Time series forecasting has been widely used to determine the future prices of stock, and the analysis and modeling of finance time series importantly guide investors' decisions and trades. In addition, in a dynamic environment such as the stock market, the nonlinearity of the time series is pronounced, immediately affecting the efficacy of stock price forecasts. Thus, this paper proposes an intelligent time series prediction system that uses sliding-window metaheuristic optimization for the purpose of predicting the stock prices of Taiwan construction companies one step ahead. It may be of great interest to home brokers who do not possess sufficient knowledge to invest in such companies. The system has a graphical user interface and functions as a stand-alone application. The developed hybrid system exhibited outstanding prediction performance and it improves overall profit for investment performance. The proposed model is a promising predictive technique for highly nonlinear time series, whose patterns are difficult to capture by traditional models.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A concurrent optimum design of a manipulator is to find the best geometrical and control parameters in the same optimization process. One of the main contributions of this paper is a concurrent method for optimum design and its comparison versus a sequential one, where the later requires several optimization stages. Besides, we statistically compare three metaheuristics: the Omnioptimizer, the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy, and the Boltzmann univariate marginal distribution algorithm for the two methodologies, in order to elucidate directions about which metaheuristic performs the best for this kind of problem, and whether it must be used in a sequential or concurrent fashion. These metaheuristics are compared with reported results in the specialized literature. In addition, we perform an analysis of results to statistically determine relations between the parameters and the objective function, as a consequence, we found the most impacting parameters to the manipulator performance.
