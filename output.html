<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents an improved pulsewidth modulation strategy in conjunction with an optimal compensator for fast capacitor voltage balancing in three-level neutral-point-clamped (NPC) inverter. The voltage balancing compensator is designed in such a way that it produces optimal unbalance compensation coefficient according to the inherent limitations related to the variability range of modulating signals. It generates maximum compensating neutral current for the full modulation depth extending into overmodulation region and throughout the entire range of load power factor angles, and thus improves the unbalance compensation ability for all the operating conditions of the inverter. The optimal compensation offset signal corresponding to each operating point is determined from the boundary limit of the auxiliary modulating signals. Particle swarm optimization is applied for such purpose. The performance of the proposed optimal compensator for different combinations of modulation index and load power factors are evaluated through extensive simulation study using Matlab/Simulink and validated in experimentation using a three-level NPC inverter prototype with induction motor load. Finally, the voltage balancing performances of the proposed compensator are compared with that available in literature to confirm the usefulness of the proposed concept.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a nonisolated ultrahigh step-down dc-dc converter for low-voltage high-current applications. The converter provides extended duty cycle for all power switches while low voltage and current stresses are imposed on semiconductor devices that cause low conduction losses and low output current ripple. In addition, soft-switching condition is achieved for all semiconductor devices without adding any active element. To achieve the improved voltage conversion ratio, a pair of coupled inductors and series capacitors is used in the interleaved step-down structure. The two auxiliary inductors provide zero-voltage zero-current switching turn on for all switches and zero-current switching turn on and turn off for all diodes. Thus, the losses associated with semiconductor components are reduced impressively and the overall efficiency of the proposed converter is improved considerably. The accuracy of the converter operation is confirmed by a 450-W laboratory prototype operating at 400-V input, 12-V output, and 100 kHz switching frequency.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Active contour models are one of the most emblematic algorithms of computer vision. Their strong theoretical foundations and high user interoperability turned them into a reference approach for object segmentation and tracking tasks. A high number of modifications have already been proposed in order to overcome the known problems of traditional snakes, such as initialization dependence and poor convergence to concavities. In this paper, we address the scenario where the user wants to segment an object that has multiple dynamic regions but some of them do not correspond to the true object boundary. We propose a novel parametric active contour model, the Sparse Multi-Bending snake, which is capable of dividing the contour into a set of contiguous regions with different bending properties. We derive a new energy function that induces such behavior and presents a group optimization strategy that can be used to find the optimal bending resistance parameter for each point of the contour. We show the flexibility of our model in a set of synthetic images. In addition, we consider two real applications, lung segmentation in Computerized Tomography data and hand segmentation in depth images. We show how the proposed method is able to improve the segmentations obtained in both applications, when compared with other active contour models.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Skeleton-based human action recognition has been a hot topic in recent years. Most existing studies are based on the skeleton data obtained from Kinect, which is noisy and unstable, in particular, in the case of occlusions. To cope with the noisy skeleton data and variation of viewpoints, this paper presents a view-invariant method for human action recognition by recovering the corrupted skeletons based on a 3D bio-constrained skeleton model and visualizing those body-level motion features obtained during the recovery process with images. The bio-constrained skeleton model is defined with two types of constraints: 1) constant bone lengths and 2) motion limits of joints. Based on the bio-constrained model, an effective method is proposed for skeleton recovery. Two types of new motion features, the Euclidean distance matrix between joints (JEDM), which contains the global structure information of the body, and the local dynamic variation of the joint Euler angles (JEAs) are used in describing human action. These two types of features are encoded into different motion images, which are fed into a two-stream convolutional neural network for learning different action patterns. The experiments on three benchmark datasets achieve better accuracy than the state-of-the-art approaches, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel algorithm to reassemble an arbitrarily shredded image to its original status. Existing reassembly pipelines commonly consist of a local matching stage and a global compositions stage. In the local stage, a key challenge is to reliably compute correct pairwise matching, for which most existing algorithms use handcrafted features, and cannot reliably handle complicated puzzles. We build a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect the compatibility of pairwise stitching, and use it to prune computed pairwise matches. To improve the network efficiency and accuracy, we transfer the calculation of CNN to the stitching region and apply a boost training strategy. In the global composition stage, instead of using the widely adopted greedy edge selection strategies, we propose two new loop closure-based searching algorithms. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods on solving various puzzles, especially challenging ones with many fragment pieces.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to the unpredictable location, fuzzy texture, and diverse shape, accurate segmentation of the kidney tumor in CT images is an important yet challenging task. To this end, we, in this paper, present a cascaded trainable segmentation model termed as Crossbar-Net. Our method combines two novel schemes: 1) we originally proposed the crossbar patches, which consists of two orthogonal non-squared patches (i.e., the vertical patch and horizontal patch). The crossbar patches are able to capture both the global and local appearance information of the kidney tumors from both the vertical and horizontal directions simultaneously. 2) With the obtained crossbar patches, we iteratively train two sub-models (i.e., horizontal sub-model and vertical sub-model) in a cascaded training manner. During the training, the trained sub-models are encouraged to become more focused on the difficult parts of the tumor automatically (i.e., mis-segmented regions). Specifically, the vertical (horizontal) sub-model is required to help segment the mis-segmented regions for the horizontal (vertical) sub-model. Thus, the two sub-models could complement each other to achieve the self-improvement until convergence. In the experiment, we evaluate our method on a real CT kidney tumor dataset which is collected from 94 different patients including 3500 CT slices. Compared with state-of-the-art segmentation methods, the results demonstrate the superior performance of our method on the Dice similarity coefficient, true positive fraction, centroid distance, and Hausdorff distance. Moreover, to exploit the generalization to other segmentation tasks, we also extend our Crossbar-Net to two related segmentation tasks: 1) cardiac segmentation in MR images and 2) breast mass segmentation in X-ray images, showing the promising results for these two tasks. Our implementation is released at https://github.com/Qianyu1226/Crossbar-Net.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Sparse coding-based anomaly detection has shown promising performance, of which the keys are feature learning, sparse representation, and dictionary learning. In this paper, we propose a new neural network for anomaly detection (termed AnomalyNet) by deeply achieving feature learning, sparse representation, and dictionary learning in three joint neural processing blocks. Specifically, to learn better features, we design a motion fusion block accompanied by a feature transfer block to enjoy the advantages of eliminating noisy background, capturing motion, and alleviating data deficiency. Furthermore, to address some disadvantages (e.g., nonadaptive updating) of the existing sparse coding optimizers and embrace the merits of neural network (e.g., parallel computing), we design a novel recurrent neural network to learn sparse representation and dictionary by proposing an adaptive iterative hard-thresholding algorithm (adaptive ISTA) and reformulating the adaptive ISTA as a new long short-term memory (LSTM). To the best of our knowledge, this could be one of the first works to bridge the  $ell _{1}$ -solver and LSTM and may provide novel insight into understanding LSTM and model-based optimization (or named differentiable programming), as well as sparse coding-based anomaly detection. Extensive experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of our method in the abnormal events detection task.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Constrained image splicing detection and localization (CISDL), which investigates two input suspected images and identifies whether one image has suspected regions pasted from the other, is a newly proposed challenging task for image forensics. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial learning framework to learn a deep matching network for CISDL. Our framework mainly consists of three building blocks. First, a deep matching network based on atrous convolution (DMAC) aims to generate two high-quality candidate masks, which indicate suspected regions of the two input images. In DMAC, atrous convolution is adopted to extract features with rich spatial information, a correlation layer based on a skip architecture is proposed to capture hierarchical features, and atrous spatial pyramid pooling is constructed to localize tampered regions at multiple scales. Second, a detection network is designed to rectify inconsistencies between the two corresponding candidate masks. Finally, a discriminative network drives the DMAC network to produce masks that are hard to distinguish from ground-truth ones. The detection network and the discriminative network collaboratively supervise the training of DMAC in an adversarial way. Besides, a sliding window-based matching strategy is investigated for high-resolution images matching. Extensive experiments, conducted on five groups of datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the superior performance of DMAC.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Gait is a useful biometric feature for human identification in video surveillance applications since it can be obtained without subject cooperation. In recent years, model-based gait recognition using a 3D skeleton has been widely studied through view-invariant modeling and kinematic gait analysis. However, existing methods integrate all frame-level feature vectors using the same criterion, even though skeleton information is highly sensitive to changes in covariate conditions such as clothing, carrying, and occlusion. The scheme inevitably reduces the frame-level discriminative power and eventually degrades performance. Instead, we propose a robust frame-level matching method for gait recognition that minimizes the influence of noisy patterns as well as secures the frame-level discriminative power. To this end, we measure the skeleton quality in terms of body symmetry for each frame. Based on the quality, we construct a quality-adjusted cost matrix between input frames and registered frames to prevent matching with noisy patterns. Our two-stage linear matching is then applied to the cost matrix to compute a frame-level discriminative score including similarity and margin. In the end, the identity of a probe is determined by a weighted majority voting scheme via frame-level scores. It enhances the robustness against inaccurate skeleton estimation results by assigning different weights for each frame based on the score. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets (UPCVgait, UPCVgaitK2, and SDUgait) and a new gait dataset which we create with consideration of unpredictable behaviors while walking. In addition, we demonstrate that our method is robust to skeleton estimation error, partial occlusion, and data loss. The CILgait dataset and MATLAB code are available at https://sites.google.com/site/seokeonchoi/gait-recognition.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a frequency diverse array-based directional modulation with artificial noise synthesis scheme is proposed to enhance the physical layer security of wireless communications. We aim to optimize the secrecy performance by jointly optimizing the frequency offsets, the beamforming vector, and the artificial-noise projection matrix (ANPM). Specifically, we address the physical layer security problems for known locations of proximal eavesdropper (Eve) and legitimate user (LU). The beamforming vector and frequency offsets are designed to preserve the signal power at LU. The ANPM is calculated to minimize the effect of AN on LU. Furthermore, we extend our approach to the case of multi-LUs with unknown Eve locations. Being different from the case of a single LU, the frequency offsets across array antennas are optimized to equally allocate transmitted power to each LU. The numerical results show that the proposed method can provide a higher secrecy performance than conventional DM methods. In the case of multi-LUs with unknown Eve locations, the proposed method can provide a high secrecy capacity while achieving almost equal achievable capacity to each LU.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper considers physical layer security enhancement mechanisms that utilize simultaneous beamforming and jamming in visible light communication systems with a randomly located eavesdropper under the assumption that there are multiple light-emitting diode (LED) transmitters and one intended user. When an eavesdropper with an augmented front-end receiver is present, the jamming is very useful for preventing the eavesdropper from wiretapping the information since it is not possible to extract only the information component from the received signal if the jamming signal is random. Thus, in this paper, an optimization problem is formulated with a focus on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio for the legitimate link, and it is solved by a heuristic method called the concave&#x2013;convex procedure. Then, a ternary scheme is proposed, which is less complicated than the full (joint) scheme, and it is optimized by adopting a formulation based on an assignment problem, the solution of which is effectively obtained by the so-called tabu search procedure. In addition, the problem of maximizing the average secrecy rate is investigated by utilizing a continuous LED model, which significantly relaxes the complication that rises from calculating the expectation with respect to the location of the eavesdropper. Our analysis and simulation results show that the proposed simultaneous beamforming and jamming strategies (both joint and ternary) are good proxies for maximizing the average secrecy rate by utilizing the statistical information on the eavesdropper&#x2019;s random location.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Multi-turn video question answering is a challenging task in visual information retrieval, which generates the accurate answer from the referenced video contents according to the visual conversation context and given question. However, the existing visual question answering methods mainly tackle the problem of single-turn video question answering, which may be ineffectively applied for multi-turn video question answering directly, due to the insufficiency of modeling the sequential conversation context. In this paper, we study the problem of multi-turn video question answering from the viewpoint of multi-stream hierarchical attention context reinforced network learning. We first propose the hierarchical attention context network for context-aware question understanding by modeling the hierarchically sequential conversation context structure. We then develop the multi-stream spatio-temporal attention network for learning the joint representation of the dynamic video contents and context-aware question embedding. We next devise a multi-step reasoning process to enhance the multi-stream hierarchical attention context network learning method. We finally predict the multiple-choice answer from the candidate answer set and further develop the reinforced decoder network to generate the open-ended natural language answer for multi-turn video question answering. We construct two large-scale multi-turn video question answering datasets. The extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Automated production systems are critical enablers for Industry 4.0 because these design-to-order, custom-built mechatronic systems are not only capable of delivering automation capabilities to satisfy the stakeholder requirements in the manufacturing/production domain, but doing so for a long period of time (e.g., several decades) during which numerous changing needs shall also be accounted for. Although traceability has long been recognized as key to sustain changes, little is known about how the traceability information is managed in place, i.e., in the native environments where the engineering artifacts reside. We contribute in this paper a survey of traceability support within state-of-the-practice tools: seven for programming logic controllers and six for building models in systems modeling language. We draw the similarities and differences from our survey results, and further present a design by leveraging the in-place traceability to better support the development and evolution of automated production systems.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a variable structure speed controller (VSSC) that guarantees the robust transient performance against the external disturbances and parameter uncertainties of an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive. Unlike the conventional VSSC applied to the IPMSMs, the proposed nonlinear compensating control term not only assures the robustness against the system uncertainties, but also implements the maximum torque per ampere technique. Furthermore, the convergence and stability of the proposed VSSC are fully proven through the Lyapunov theory by introducing reasonable bounded uncertainties which determine a feasible range for the system dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is investigated through the simulation using MATLAB/Simulink and experiment using a prototype IPMSM drive system with a TI TMS320F28335 DSP. Finally, the proposed VSSC can ensure faster and more robust transient response than the conventional proportional-integral speed controller under the dynamic load conditions including the uncertainties.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is revolutionizing the retail industry for manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers to improve operational efficiency and consumer experience. In IIoT-enabled retail marketing, reputation systems play a critical role to boost mutual trust among industrial entities and build consumer confidence. In this paper, we focus on reputation management in the consumer&#x2013;retailer channel, where retailers can accumulate reputations from consumer feedbacks. To encourage consumers to post feedbacks without worrying about being tracked or retaliated, we propose an anonymous reputation system that preserves consumer identities and individual review confidentialities. To increase system transparency and reliability, we further exploit the tamper-proof nature and the distributed consensus mechanism of the blockchain technology. With system designs based on various cryptographic primitives and a Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol, our blockchain-based reputation system is more efficient to offer high levels of privacy guarantees compared with existing ones. Finally, we explore the implementation challenges of the blockchain-based architecture and present a proof-of-concept prototype system by Parity Ethereum. We measure the on/off-chain performance with the scalability discussion to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Applying consortium blockchain as a trust layer for heterogeneous industrial Internet-of-Things devices is cost-effective. However, with an increase in computing power, some powerful attacks (e.g., the 51&#x0025; attack) are inevitable and will cause severe consequences. Recent studies also confirm that anonymity and immutability of blockchain have been abused to facilitate black market trades, etc. To operate controllable blockchain for IIoT devices, it is necessary to rewrite blockchain history back to a normal state once the chain is breached. Ateniese et al. proposed redactable blockchain by using chameleon hash (CH) to replace traditional hash function, it allows blockchain history to be written when needed (EuroS&amp;P 2017). However, we cannot apply this idea directly to IIoT without solving the following problems: (1) achieve a decentralized design of CH; (2) update the signatures accordingly to authenticate the redacted contents; (3) satisfy the low-computing need of the individual IIoT device. In this paper, we overcome the above issues by proposing the first threshold chameleon hash (TCH) and accountable-and-sanitizable chameleon signature (ASCS) schemes. Based on them, we build a redactable consortium blockchain which is efficient for IIoT devices to operate. It allows a group of authorized sensors to write and rewrite blockchain without causing any hard forks. Basically, TCH is the first TCH and ASCS is a public-key signature supporting file-level and block-level modifications of signatures without impairing authentications. Additionally, ASCS achieves accountability to avoid abuse of redaction. While security analysis validates our proposals, the simulation results show that redaction is acceptably efficient if it is executed at a small scale or if we adopt a coarse-grained redaction while sacrificing some securities.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The performance of model-based state-of-charge (SOC) estimation method relies on an accurate battery model. Nonlinear models are thus proposed to accurately describe the external characteristics of the lithium-ion battery. The nonlinear estimation algorithms and online parameter identification methods are needed to guarantee the accuracy of the model-based SOC estimation with nonlinear battery models. A new approach forming a dynamic linear battery model is proposed in this paper, which enables the application of the linear Kalman filter for SOC estimation and also avoids the usage of online parameter identification methods. With a moving window technology, partial least squares regression is able to establish a series of piecewise linear battery models automatically. One element state-space equation is then obtained to estimate the SOC from the linear Kalman filter. The experiments on a LiFePO<sub>4</sub> battery prove the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the extended Kalman filter with two resistance and capacitance equivalent circuit model and the adaptive unscented Kalman filter with least squares support vector machines.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the automated demand response (DR) problem in smart grids equipped with information and communication technology networks, where power generating and consuming units can exchange information as a multiagent system (MAS), and a real-time pricing (RTP) scheme is proposed. When the communication graph among agents is connected, a novel parallel and distributed consensus-based algorithm is proposed to derive an RTP scheme to facilitate DR, and when communication uncertainties exist, a robust consensus algorithm is proposed to cease the effect of uncertainties. Next, this paper proposes a novel control mechanism to tackle the problem of disconnected communication among agents, e.g., under cyber-attacks, by employing the so-called mixed communication-broadcast control architecture where the underlying ideas are twofold. First, each area in the grid associated with a connected subgraph is controlled by a MAS to guarantee the power balance and to reach consensus on the local electric price for that area. Second, a supervisory unit observes those local electric prices to calculate the global electric price for the whole grid and then broadcasts to all units so that they can properly adjust their output powers. Simulations are carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system to validate the proposed control mechanisms.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents an electric arc furnace (EAF) optimization framework intended to define optimal control profiles for the EAF, in order to increase its efficiency and thus reduce the energy consumption. The framework aims to minimize controllable losses and to maximize energy transfer to the bath and, consequently, minimize the operational costs. This is achieved through improved actuation of the EAF inputs, i.e., transformer power, oxygen lancing, and carbon addition. To achieve maximal energy transfer to the bath and to reduce the heat losses from the arcs, proper properties of the slag, such as foaminess and basicity, are a subject of considerable attention. The framework is designed as a model-based optimization, intended to be executed online in parallel to the actual EAF process. In order to achieve sufficiently low computational complexity and to allow process optimization by arbitrary time intervals, the framework uses path constraints instead of end-point constraints. A combination of several optimization algorithms is used to solve the optimization problem. The validation of the framework was performed by comparing the predicted and the measured operational variables. Simulation results show that optimized operation profiles lead to a significant decrease in operational costs and production times.
