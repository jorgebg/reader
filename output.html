<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Voice Assistants (VAs) such as Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant rely on
wake-word detection to respond to people's commands, which could potentially be
vulnerable to audio adversarial examples. In this work, we target our attack on
the wake-word detection system, jamming the model with some inconspicuous
background music to deactivate the VAs while our audio adversary is present. We
implemented an emulated wake-word detection system of Amazon Alexa based on
recent publications. We validated our models against the real Alexa in terms of
wake-word detection accuracy. Then we computed our audio adversaries with
consideration of expectation over transform and we implemented our audio
adversary with a differentiable synthesizer. Next, we verified our audio
adversaries digitally on hundreds of samples of utterances collected from the
real world. Our experiments show that we can effectively reduce the recognition
F1 score of our emulated model from 93.4% to 11.0%. Finally, we tested our
audio adversary over the air, and verified it works effectively against Alexa,
reducing its F1 score from 92.5% to 11.0%.; We also verified that
non-adversarial music does not disable Alexa as effectively as our music at the
same sound level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world
adversarial attack against a commercial-grade VA wake-word detection system.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have received extensive attention recently.
Massive data has been stored on permission-less blockchains. The analysis on
massive blockchain data can bring huge business values. However, the lack of
well-processed up-to-date blockchain datasets impedes big data analytics of
blockchain data. To fill this gap, we collect and process the up-to-date
on-chain data from Ethereum, which is one of the most popular permission-less
blockchains. We name these well-processed Ethereum datasets as XBlock-ETH,
which consists of the data of blockchain transactions, smart contracts, and
cryptocurrencies (i.e., tokens). The basic statistics and exploration of these
datasets are presented. We also outline the possible research opportunities.
The datasets with the raw data and codes have been publicly released online.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Biometric authentication is getting increasingly popular due to the
convenience of using unique individual traits, such as fingerprints, palm
veins, irises. Especially fingerprints are widely used nowadays due to the
availability and low cost of fingerprint scanners. To avoid identity theft or
impersonation, fingerprint data is typically stored locally, e.g., in a trusted
hardware module, in a single device that is used for user enrollment and
authentication. Local storage, however, limits the ability to implement
distributed applications, in which users can enroll their fingerprint once and
use it to access multiple physical locations and mobile applications
afterwards.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we present a distributed authentication system that stores
fingerprint data in a server or cloud infrastructure in a privacy-preserving
way. Multiple devices can be connected and perform user enrollment or
verification. To secure the privacy and integrity of sensitive data, we employ
a cryptographic construct called fuzzy vault. We highlight challenges in
implementing fuzzy vault-based authentication, for which we propose and compare
alternative solutions. We conduct a security analysis of our biometric
cryptosystem, and as a proof of concept, we build an authentication system for
access control using resource-constrained devices (Raspberry Pis) connected to
fingerprint scanners and the Microsoft Azure cloud environment. Furthermore, we
evaluate the fingerprint matching algorithm against the well-known FVC2006
database and show that it can achieve comparable accuracy to widely-used
matching techniques that are not designed for privacy, while remaining
efficient with an authentication time of few seconds.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Direct Mobile-to-Mobile communication mode known also as Device-to-Device
(D2D) communication is expected to be supported in the 5G mobile system. D2D
communication aims to improve system spectrum efficiency, overall system
throughput, energy efficiency and reduce the connection delay between devices.
However, new security threats and challenges need to be considered regarding
device and user authentication to avoid unauthorized access, abuse and attacks
on the whole system. In this paper, a strong standalone authentication
technique therefore is proposed. It is based on combining users biometric
identities and a new clone-resistant device identity. The novel property of the
proposal is that it is fully independent on both device manufacturer and mobile
system operator. The biometric identity deploys user keystroke dynamics and
accelerometer to generate user biometric identity by deploying a machine
learning technique. The proposed mobile device clone-resistant identity is
based on deploying a new concept of a pure digital clone-resistant structure
which is both manufacturer and mobile operator-independent. When combining both
identities, a mutually authenticated D2D secured link between any two devices
can be established in addition to a strong user-device authentication.
Furthermore, the concept does not allow the managing trusted authority to
intercept users private links. Being an independent and standalone system, the
technique would offer a broad spectrum of attractive future smart applications
over the 5G mobile system infrastructure.

<p>Medical training and clinical practice are continuously associated with stress&#8212;often welcomed and considered a positive motivating factor. However, the recently recognised triad of emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation, and reduced professional efficacy, defined as burnout, questions the role of stress in clinical practice. Burnout has the propensity to put patient care at risk and has a detrimental effect on medical workforce retainment. A health-care system under pressure undoubtably contributes to professional burnout: long working hours, outdated and not fit-for-purpose technologies, and mounting documentation requirements shift the focus away from patient care, causing work&#8211;life imbalance, insufficient job resources, ineffective multidisciplinary teams, and a dismissive organisational culture.

<p>Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses; it is associated with benign inflammatory outgrowths of the sinonasal mucosa. Despite health-care costs greater than US$5 billion annually,1 treatment options for patients with CRSwNP have been limited to corticosteroids (topical or systemic), sinus surgery, or both. In severe cases, nasal polyps can recur, prompting increased corticosteroid use and revision surgeries. New treatment options for CRSwNP are sorely needed.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used for image recognition, speech recognition, and other pattern analysis tasks. Despite the success of DNNs, these systems can be exploited by what is termed adversarial examples. An adversarial example, in which a small distortion is added to the input data, can be designed to be misclassified by the DNN while remaining undetected by humans or other systems. Such adversarial examples have been studied mainly in the image domain. Recently, however, studies on adversarial examples have been expanding into the voice domain. For example, when an adversarial example is applied to enemy wiretapping devices (victim classifiers) in a military environment, the enemy device will misinterpret the intended message. In such scenarios, it is necessary that friendly wiretapping devices (protected classifiers) should not be deceived. Therefore, the selective adversarial example concept can be useful in mixed situations, defined as situations in which there is both a classifier to be protected and a classifier to be attacked. In this paper, we propose a selective audio adversarial example with minimum distortion that will be misclassified as the target phrase by a victim classifier but correctly classified as the original phrase by a protected classifier. To generate such examples, a transformation is carried out to minimize the probability of incorrect classification by the protected classifier and that of correct classification by the victim classifier. We conducted experiments targeting the state-of-the-art DeepSpeech voice recognition model using Mozilla Common Voice datasets and the Tensorflow library. They showed that the proposed method can generate a selective audio adversarial example with a 91.67% attack success rate and 85.67% protected classifier accuracy.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>People constantly share their photographs with others through various social media sites. With the aid of the privacy settings provided by social media sites, image owners can designate scope of sharing, e.g., close friends and acquaintances. However, even if the owner of a photograph carefully sets the privacy setting to exclude a given individual who is not supposed to see the photograph, the photograph may still eventually reach a wider audience, including those clearly undesired through unanticipated channels of disclosure, causing a privacy breach. Moreover, it is often the case that a given image involves multiple stakeholders who are also depicted in the photograph. Due to various personalities, it is even more challenging to reach agreement on the privacy settings for these multi-owner photographs. In this paper, we propose a privacy risk reminder system, called REMIND, which estimates the probability that a shared photograph may be seen by unwanted people-through the social graph-who are not included in the original sharing list. We tackle this problem from a novel angle by digging into the big data regarding image sharing history. Specifically, the social media providers possess a huge amount of image sharing information (e.g., what photographs are shared with whom) of their users. By analyzing and modeling such rich information, we build a sophisticated probability model that efficiently aggregates the image disclosure probabilities along different possible image propagation chains and loops. If the computed disclosure probability indicates high risks of privacy breach, a reminder is issued to the image owner to help revise the privacy settings (or, at least, inform the user about this accidental disclosure risk). The proposed REMIND system also has a nice feature of policy harmonization that helps resolve privacy differences in multi-owner photographs. We have carried out a user study to validate the rationale of our proposed solutions and also conducte-
 experimental studies to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed REMIND system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The side-channel leakage is a consequence of program execution in a computer processor, and understanding relationship between code execution and information leakage is a necessary step in estimating information leakage and its capacity limits. This paper proposes a methodology to relate program execution to electromagnetic side-channel emanations and estimates side-channel information capacity created by execution of series of instructions (e.g., a function, a procedure, or a program) in a processor. To model dependence among program instructions in a code, we propose to use Markov source model, which includes the dependencies among sequence of instructions as well as dependencies among instructions as they pass through a pipeline of the processor. The emitted electromagnetic (EM) signals during instruction executions are natural choice for the inputs into the model. To obtain the channel inputs for the proposed model, we derive a mathematical relationship between the emanated instruction signal power (ESP) and total emanated signal power while running a program. Then, we derive the leakage capacity of EM side channels created by execution of series of instructions in a processor. Finally, we provide experimental results to demonstrate that leakages could be severe and that a dedicated attacker could obtain important information.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a widely used tool for machine learning in distributed settings where a machine learning model is trained over distributed data sources through an interactive process of local computation and message passing. Such an iterative process could cause privacy concerns of data owners. The goal of this paper is to provide differential privacy for ADMM-based distributed machine learning. Prior approaches on differentially private ADMM exhibit low utility under high privacy guarantee and assume the objective functions of the learning problems to be smooth and strongly convex. To address these concerns, we propose a novel differentially private ADMM-based distributed learning algorithm called DP-ADMM, which combines an approximate augmented Lagrangian function with time-varying Gaussian noise addition in the iterative process to achieve higher utility for general objective functions under the same differential privacy guarantee. We also apply the moments accountant method to analyze the end-to-end privacy loss. The theoretical analysis shows that the DP-ADMM can be applied to a wider class of distributed learning problems, is provably convergent, and offers an explicit utility-privacy tradeoff. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to provide explicit convergence and utility properties for differentially private ADMM-based distributed learning algorithms. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can achieve good convergence and model accuracy under high end-to-end differential privacy guarantee.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper investigates the use of resistor- inductor (RL) filters for motor overvoltage issues caused by cables connecting inverters to electric machines. Using existing filter design formulae and fixing the desired peak motor voltage, an RL filter is designed for a 15-kW industrial drive. This filter is used with a Silicon IGBT inverter and a matching between the design targets and the experimental results are found. Using the same filter with an SiC MOSFET inverter, a detrimental effect in overvoltage mitigation task is found. From simulations, it is noticed that combination of filter resistor parasitic inductance and high dv/dt causes unpredicted additional high-frequency motor overvoltages. These phenomena require higher filter inductance values with respect to the standard one, thus previous filter design formulae cannot be used. New design formulae, valid when inverters with high dv/dt are used, are proposed and experimentally validated. Interestingly, using the proposed formulae, it is discovered that the best filter resistance is not equal to the characteristic impedance of the cable. A design guideline that permits to optimally design the RL filter without simulation tool, considering the resistor parasitic inductance and the inverter dv/dt is finally proposed.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A direct cooling design using hollow conductors with the coolant flowing inside can significantly improve the heat dissipation in an electrical machine. To predict the thermal performances of an electrical machine with such cooling configuration, this paper proposes a computationally efficient thermal model of hollow conductors with direct cooling features. The hollow conductor is modeled using four equivalent solid cuboidal elements with a three-dimensional thermal network and internal heat generation. The heat transfer coefficient between the coolant and conductors is determined by an empirical model considering fluid dynamics behaviors. Axial discretization is performed to take into account the nonuniform temperature distribution along the axial direction. Experimental validation is performed with a U-shaped hollow conductor test rig. Compared to computational fluid dynamics analysis, the proposed thermal model is much more computationally efficient, and thus can be incorporated into design optimization process and electrothermal simulations of the electrical machine over a driving cycle.

<p>In this paper, automated omnidirectional touch probe (ODTP) including adaptive tuning of the complex contour curve with optimal interpolation and motion planning based on a hybrid multiaxis robot (HMAR) with dual drive gantry-type machine (DDGM) are presented. It is called an &#x201c;omnidirectional&#x201d; because the 6-degrees of freedom ODTP in tool center point mode can always maintain normal direction towards the object contour curve. The new optimal solutions of the interpolation and motion planning are provided to tackle the small segments issues for a complex curvature object. We present an algorithm to maintain maximum acceleration, so that it generates smooth and efficient three-dimensional reverse object in a higher order complex contour trajectory composed of piecewise small segments. As a result, the constant moving speed is very important to certain applications, such as gluing, welding, and laser cutting, to preserve quality processing. The utilization of object symmetry, extension, and synthesis properties to simplify the process of performing reverse engineering is described. These methods reduce the time required for the touch probe to detect the points. The experimental implementation to demonstrate the success of this paper with video clip are presented.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Control based on vision data is a growing field of research and it is widespread in industry. The amount of data in each image and the processing needed to obtain control-relevant information from this data lead to significant delays with a large variability in the control loops. This often causes performance deterioration since in many cases the delay variability is not explicitly addressed in the control design. In this paper, we approach this problem by applying the ideas of recently developed model-based control design methods, which are tailored to address stochastic delays directly, to the motion control of an omnidirectional robot with a vision-based self-localization algorithm. The completion time or delay of the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) based localization algorithm is identified as a stochastic random variable with significant variability, illustrating the practical difficulties with data processing. Our main aim is to show that the novel deadline-driven and event-driven control designs significantly outperform a traditional periodic control implementation for a stochastic optimal control performance index.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Collective activity recognition, which tells what activity a group of people is performing, is a cutting-edge research topic in computer vision. Different from action performed by individuals, collective activity needs to consider the complex interactions among different people. However, most previous works require exhaustive annotations such as accurate label information of individual actions, pairwise interactions, and poses, which could not be easily available in practice. Moreover, most of them treat human detection as a decoupled task before collective activity recognition and leverage all detected persons. This not only ignores the mutual relation between the two tasks, which makes it hard for filtering out irrelevant people, but also probably increases the computation burden when reasoning the collective activities. In this paper, we propose a fast weakly supervised deep learning architecture for collective activity recognition. For fast inference, we propose to make the actor detection and weakly supervised collective activity reasoning collaborate in an end-to-end framework by sharing convolutional layers between them. The joint learning makes the two tasks united and reinforced each other, so that it is more effective to filter out the outliers who are not involved in the activity. For the weakly supervised learning, we propose a latent embedding scheme for mining person-group interactive relationship to get rid of the use of any pairwise relation between people and the individual action labels as well. The experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves comparable or even better performance as compared to the state-of-the-art on three datasets. Our joint modelling reasons collective activities at the speed of 22.65 fps, which is the fastest ever known and substantially makes collective activity recognition more towards real-time applications.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Single image dehazing is a critical image pre-processing step for subsequent high-level computer vision tasks. However, it remains challenging due to its ill-posed nature. Existing dehazing models tend to suffer from model overcomplexity and computational inefficiency or have limited representation capacity. To tackle these challenges, here, we propose a fast and accurate multi-scale end-to-end dehazing network, called FAMED-Net, which comprises encoders at three scales and a fusion module to efficiently and directly learn the haze-free image. Each encoder consists of cascaded and densely connected point-wise convolutional layers and pooling layers. Since no larger convolutional kernels are used and features are reused layer-by-layer, FAMED-Net is lightweight and computationally efficient. Thorough empirical studies on public synthetic datasets (including RESIDE) and real-world hazy images demonstrate the superiority of FAMED-Net over other representative state-of-the-art models with respect to model complexity, computational efficiency, restoration accuracy, and cross-set generalization. The code will be made publicly available.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The bitonic filter was recently developed to embody the novel concept of signal bitonicity (one local extremum within a set range) to differentiate from noise, by use of data ranking and linear operators. For processing images, the spatial extent was locally constrained to a fixed circular mask. Since structure in natural images varies, a novel structurally varying bitonic filter is presented, which locally adapts the mask, without following patterns in the noise. This new filter includes novel robust structurally varying morphological operations, with efficient implementations, and a novel formulation of non-iterative directional Gaussian filtering. Data thresholds are also integrated with the morphological operations, increasing noise reduction for low noise, and enabling a multi-resolution framework for high noise levels. The structurally varying bitonic filter is presented without presuming prior knowledge of morphological filtering, and compared to high-performance linear noise-reduction filters, to set this novel concept in context. These are tested over a wide range of noise levels, on a fairly broad set of images. The new filter is a considerable improvement on the fixed-mask bitonic, outperforms anisotropic diffusion and image-guided filtering in all but extremely low noise, non-local means at all noise levels, but not the block-matching 3D filter, though results are promising for very high noise. The structurally varying bitonic tends to have less characteristic residual noise in regions of smooth signal, and very good preservation of signal edges, though with some loss of small scale detail when compared to the block-matching 3D filter. The efficient implementation means that processing time, though slower than the fixed-mask bitonic filter, remains competitive.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Degraded image semantic segmentation is of great importance in autonomous driving, highway navigation systems, and many other safety-related applications and it was not systematically studied before. In general, image degradations increase the difficulty of semantic segmentation, usually leading to decreased semantic segmentation accuracy. Therefore, performance on the underlying clean images can be treated as an upper bound of degraded image semantic segmentation. While the use of supervised deep learning has substantially improved the state of the art of semantic image segmentation, the gap between the feature distribution learned using the clean images and the feature distribution learned using the degraded images poses a major obstacle in improving the degraded image semantic segmentation performance. The conventional strategies for reducing the gap include: 1) Adding image-restoration based pre-processing modules; 2) Using both clean and the degraded images for training; 3) Fine-tuning the network pre-trained on the clean image. In this paper, we propose a novel Dense-Gram Network to more effectively reduce the gap than the conventional strategies and segment degraded images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Dense-Gram Network yields state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance on degraded images synthesized using PASCAL VOC 2012, SUNRGBD, CamVid, and CityScapes datasets.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A super-resolution optical imaging method is presented that relies on the distinct temporal information associated with each fluorescent optical reporter to determine its spatial position to high precision with measurements of heavily scattered light. This multiple-emitter localization approach uses a diffusion equation forward model in a cost function, and has the potential to achieve micron-scale spatial resolution through centimeters of tissue. Utilizing some degree of temporal separation for the reporter emissions, position and emission strength are determined using a computationally efficient temporal-scanning multiresolution algorithm. The approach circumvents the spatial resolution challenges faced by earlier optical imaging approaches by using a diffusion equation forward model, and is promising for in vivo applications. For example, in principle, the method could be used to localize individual neurons firing throughout a rodent brain, enabling the direct imaging of neural network activity.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The emerging concentrating solar power plant (CSPP) represents one of the promising technologies for promoting solar power applications. In this paper, risk-constrained day-ahead scheduling strategies for a virtual power plant (VPP) integrating a CSPP with some responsive residential and industrial loads are proposed considering the uncertainties from electricity price, thermal production of the solar field of the CSPP, and participation factor of residential demand response. The well-established information gap decision theory (IGDT) is utilized to hedge against the risk caused by these uncertainties. Based on IGDT, both a robust scheduling strategy for the risk-aversion decision maker and an opportunistic scheduling strategy for the opportunity-seeking decision maker are presented for hedging the profit risk of the VPP against variations of electricity price, thermal production, and demand response. Simulation results show that the presented IGDT-based method can act as an effective tool for managing risks from uncertainties, and also demonstrate that the RA VPP should focus more on the thermal production of the CSPP so as to guarantee the desired profit, whereas the OS VPP should pay more attention to the market price so as to achieve a windfall profit.

<p>Wireless extensions of time-critical industrial communication systems could provide many benefits including increased flexibility and mobility. Moreover, they might enable completely new manufacturing solutions. On the other hand, seamless integration to the existing infrastructure and high performance with minimal increase of latency and jitter are key requirements. A wireless network with these features is developed in the project ParSec. Here, especially the MAC layer design and the gateway concepts between the existing Industrial Ethernet solutions and the wireless ParSec system are improved. In this paper, we show the ParSec system's proof of concept using typical industrial components. In the experimental evaluation, low round-trip times and low jitter were measured that satisfy the majority of industrial requirements.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Feature extraction has become an essential prerequisite of developing data-based models, control and monitoring tools from massive industrial data. When the temporal correlation is significant, the latent feature is commonly described by a dynamic model, such as the state-space model. Industrial processes are widely subject to certain boundary constraints. However, most of the existing feature extraction methods have not considered the boundary constraints on the latent features. This study develops a learning approach with consideration of boundary constrained latent features. To retain dynamic behavior with a compact probability description, a novel state transition model is developed by using the Beta distribution for the constrained state. To learn the constrained dynamic feature from regularly observed data, a nonlinear observation function is incorporated, and the variational Bayesian inference is adopted for solving the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical simulations along with industrial data sets.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Smart factory is a typical application scene of Internet of Things and wireless terminal devices naturally compose a three-dimensional (3-D) industrial wireless network. A primary requirement in the network is delivering packets from source node to destination node. Most geographic routing algorithms are designed for planar networks and they do not suit 3-D networks. In this paper, we extend a greedy perimeter stateless routing algorithm (GPSR) into three dimensions named GPSR-3D. In GPSR-3D, each node decides next hop of a packet by cooperating with only local neighbors and hence this algorithm is totally distributed. GPSR-3D comprises two packet forwarding patterns named greedy forwarding pattern (GFP) and surface forwarding pattern (SFP). In GFP, a node always sends the packet to a neighbor closest to destination and when it fails, SFP is employed for recovery. In SFP, we first divide the whole network space into a set of subspaces based on a novel 3-D geometric structure. Then, a parallel polyhedron traverse algorithm is proposed to recover local minima. A flowchart of GPSR-3D is given to clearly present the process of delivering a packet based on GFP and SFP. Simulation results show that GPSR-3D is of great reliability, energy efficiency and storage efficiency. Specifically, data transmission amount in GPSR-3D is about 67% and 71% to that of multihop Delaunay triangulation (MDT) and GDSTR-3D on average. Moreover, GPSR-3D performs much better than MDT and GDSTR-3D in terms of average storage cost and the average storage space in GPSR-3D is about 48% and 26% to that of MDT and GDSTR-3D, respectively.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Privacy-preserving distributed data fusion is a pretreatment process in data mining involving security models. In this paper, we present a method of implementing multiparty data fusion, wherein redundant attributes of a same set of individuals are stored by multiple parties. In particular, the merged data does not suffer from background attacks or other reasoning attacks, and individual attributes are not leaked. To achieve this, we present three algorithms that satisfy K-anonymous and differential privacy. Experimental results on real datasets suggest that the proposed algorithm can effectively preserve information in data mining tasks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To the Editor Dr Hahn and colleagues reported noninferiority of P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy compared with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) among patients receiving current-generation drug-eluting stents. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Assuming a 12-month event rate of 4.0% for the DAPT group, the noninferiority margin for the event rate difference (monotherapy minus DAPT) was set at 1.8%. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the 12-month cumulative incidence of the primary outcome was 2.9% for monotherapy and 2.5% for DAPT. Since the upper bound of the confidence interval for the event rate difference was 1.3%, the authors concluded that monotherapy was noninferior to DAPT. However, only 79.3% of patients in the monotherapy group received the assigned treatment compared with 95.2% in the DAPT group. Moreover, the proportion of patients receiving aspirin beyond 3 months in the monotherapy group was 14.4% at 6 months and 8.9% at 12 months. With these adherence issues, the intention-to-treat analysis likely underestimated the true event rate difference. In the per-protocol analysis, the 12-month cumulative incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events was 3.1% for monotherapy and 2.5% for DAPT. However, the per-protocol analysis is potentially biased because it does not preserve randomization.
