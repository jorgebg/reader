<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Smart contracts are software programs featuring both traditional applications
and distributed data storage on blockchains. Ethereum is a prominent blockchain
platform with the support of smart contracts. The smart contracts act as
autonomous agents in critical decentralized applications and hold a significant
amount of cryptocurrency to perform trusted transactions and agreements.
Millions of dollars as part of the assets held by the smart contracts were
stolen or frozen through the notorious attacks just between 2016 and 2018, such
as the DAO attack, Parity Multi-Sig Wallet attack, and the integer
underflow/overflow attacks. These attacks were caused by a combination of
technical flaws in designing and implementing software codes. However, many
more vulnerabilities of less severity are to be discovered because of the
scripting natures of the Solidity language and the non-updateable feature of
blockchains. Hence, we surveyed 16 security vulnerabilities in smart contract
programs, and some vulnerabilities do not have a proper solution. This survey
aims to identify the key vulnerabilities in smart contracts on Ethereum in the
perspectives of their internal mechanisms and software security
vulnerabilities. By correlating 16 Ethereum vulnerabilities and 19 software
security issues, we predict that many attacks are yet to be exploited. And we
have explored many software tools to detect the security vulnerabilities of
smart contracts in terms of static analysis, dynamic analysis, and formal
verification. This survey presents the security problems in smart contracts
together with the available analysis tools and the detection methods. We also
investigated the limitations of the tools or analysis methods with respect to
the identified security vulnerabilities of the smart contracts.

<p>We present a policy and process framework for secure environments for
productive data science research projects at scale, by combining prevailing
data security threat and risk profiles into five sensitivity tiers, and, at
each tier, specifying recommended policies for data classification, data
ingress, software ingress, data egress, user access, user device control, and
analysis environments. By presenting design patterns for security choices for
each tier, and using software defined infrastructure so that a different,
independent, secure research environment can be instantiated for each project

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Private quantum money allows a bank to mint quantum money states that it can
later verify, but that no one else can forge. In classically verifiable quantum
money - introduced by Gavinsky [Gav12] - the verification is done via an
interactive protocol between the bank and the user, where the communication is
classical, and the computational resources required of the bank are classical.
In this work, we consider stateless interactive protocols in which the minting
is likewise classical, and construct a private money scheme that achieves these
two notions simultaneously (i.e., classical verification and classical
minting). We call such a construction a private semi-quantum money scheme,
since all the requirements from the bank in terms of computation and
communication are classical.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Video sharing platforms like YouTube are increasingly targeted by aggression
and hate attacks. Prior work has shown how these attacks often take place as a
result of "raids," i.e., organized efforts by ad-hoc mobs coordinating from
third-party communities. Despite the increasing relevance of this phenomenon,
however, online services often lack effective countermeasures to mitigate it.
Unlike well-studied problems like spam and phishing, coordinated aggressive
behavior both targets and is perpetrated by humans, making defense mechanisms
that look for automated activity unsuitable. Therefore, the de-facto solution
is to reactively rely on user reports and human moderation.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose an automated solution to identify YouTube videos
that are likely to be targeted by coordinated harassers from fringe communities
like 4chan. First, we characterize and model YouTube videos along several axes
(metadata, audio transcripts, thumbnails) based on a ground truth dataset of
videos that were targeted by raids. Then, we use an ensemble of classifiers to
determine the likelihood that a video will be raided with very good results
(AUC up to 94%). Overall, our work provides an important first step towards
deploying proactive systems to detect and mitigate coordinated hate attacks on
platforms like YouTube.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Temperature sensing and control systems are widely used in the closed-loop
control of critical processes such as maintaining the thermal stability of
patients, or in alarm systems for detecting temperature-related hazards.
However, the security of these systems has yet to be completely explored,
leaving potential attack surfaces that can be exploited to take control over
critical systems.
</p>
<p>In this paper we investigate the reliability of temperature-based control
systems from a security and safety perspective. We show how unexpected
consequences and safety risks can be induced by physical-level attacks on
analog temperature sensing components. For instance, we demonstrate that an
adversary could remotely manipulate the temperature sensor measurements of an
infant incubator to cause potential safety issues, without tampering with the
victim system or triggering automatic temperature alarms. This attack exploits
the unintended rectification effect that can be induced in operational and
instrumentation amplifiers to control the sensor output, tricking the internal
control loop of the victim system to heat up or cool down. Furthermore, we show
how the exploit of this hardware-level vulnerability could affect different
classes of analog sensors that share similar signal conditioning processes.
</p>
<p>Our experimental results indicate that conventional defenses commonly
deployed in these systems are not sufficient to mitigate the threat, so we
propose a prototype design of a low-cost anomaly detector for critical
applications to ensure the integrity of temperature sensor signals.

<p>One of the basic tenets of evidence-based medicine is that randomisation is crucial to understanding treatment effects. Observational studies are subject to confounding and selection bias. Researchers can adjust for measured differences between treatment groups, but unmeasured or unmeasurable differences might exist between groups that obscure true treatment effects and cannot be accounted for by any statistical method.1 The published medical literature is filled with examples of associations between treatment and outcome identified in observational studies that were subsequently disproven by well conducted randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Public cloud offers economy of scale to adapt workload changes in an autonomic manner, maximizing the use of resources. Through network function virtualization (NFV), network operators can move LTE core to the cloud; hence removing their dependency on carrier-grade LTE network functions. Recent research efforts discuss performance, latency, and fault tolerance of LTE NFV, largely ignoring the security aspects. In this paper, we discover new vulnerabilities that LTE NFV face today with no standard solutions to address them. These vulnerabilities span at both LTE control and user planes. To address them, we propose vEPC-sec that cryptographically secures LTE control-plane signaling messages in the cloud. It provides distributed key management and key derivation schemes to derive shared-symmetric keys for securing the communication between any two network functions. Our approach provides encryption and integrity protection to the messages even during virtual machines scalability and failure recovery scenarios. vEPC-sec also prevents user-plane vulnerabilities by ensuring that LTE routing modules should faithfully forward the LTE subscriber packets.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a self-guiding multimodal LSTM (sgLSTM) image captioning model is proposed to handle an uncontrolled imbalanced real-world image-sentence dataset. We collect a FlickrNYC dataset from Flickr as our testbed with 306,165 images and the original text descriptions uploaded by the users are utilized as the ground truth for training. Descriptions in the FlickrNYC dataset vary dramatically ranging from short term-descriptions to long paragraph-descriptions and can describe any visual aspects, or even refer to objects that are not depicted. To deal with the imbalanced and noisy situation and to fully explore the dataset itself, we propose a novel guiding textual feature extracted utilizing a multimodal LSTM (mLSTM) model. Training of mLSTM is based on the portion of data in which the image content and the corresponding descriptions are strongly bonded. Afterward, during the training of sgLSTM on the rest training data, this guiding information serves as additional input to the network along with the image representations and the ground-truth descriptions. By integrating these input components into a multimodal block, we aim to form a training scheme with the textual information tightly coupled with the image content. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed sgLSTM model outperforms the traditional state-of-the-art multimodal RNN captioning framework in successfully describing the key components of the input images.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A fully-parallelized work-time optimal algorithm is presented for computing the exact Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) of a 2D binary image with the size of  $ntimes n$ . Unlike existing PRAM (Parallel Random Access Machine) and other algorithms, this algorithm is suitable for implementation on modern SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) architectures such as GPUs. As a fundamental operation of 2D EDT, 1D EDT is efficiently parallelized first. Specifically, the GPU algorithm for the 1D EDT, which uses CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) binary functions, such as ballot(), ffs(), clz(), and shfl(), runs in  $O(log_{32}n)$  time and performs  $O(n)$  work. Using the 1D EDT as a fundamental operation, the fully-parallelized work-time optimal 2D EDT algorithm is designed. This algorithm consists of three steps. Step 1 of the algorithm runs in  $O(log_{32}n)$  time and performs  $O(N)$  ( $N = n^{2}$ ) of total work on GPU. Step 2 performs  $O(N)$  of total work and has an expected time complexity of  $O(logn)$  on GPU. Step 3 runs in  $O(log_{32}n)$  time and performs  $O(N)$  of total work on GPU. As far as we know, this algorithm is the first fully-parallelized and realized work-time optimal algorithm for GPUs. The experimental results show that this algorit-
m outperforms the prior state-of-the-art GPU algorithms.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Sonar imagery plays a significant role in oceanic applications since there is little natural light underwater, and light is irrelevant to sonar imaging. Sonar images are very likely to be affected by various distortions during the process of transmission via the underwater acoustic channel for further analysis. At the receiving end, the reference image is unavailable due to the complex and changing underwater environment and our unfamiliarity with it. To the best of our knowledge, one of the important usages of sonar images is target recognition on the basis of contour information. The contour degradation degree for a sonar image is relevant to the distortions contained in it. To this end, we developed a new no-reference contour degradation measurement for perceiving the quality of sonar images. The sparsities of a series of transform coefficient matrices, which are descriptive of contour information, are first extracted as features from the frequency and spatial domains. The contour degradation degree for a sonar image is then measured by calculating the ratios of extracted features before and after filtering this sonar image. Finally, a bootstrap aggregating (bagging)-based support vector regression module is learned to capture the relationship between the contour degradation degree and the sonar image quality. The results of experiments validate that the proposed metric is competitive with the state-of-the-art reference-based quality metrics and outperforms the latest reference-free competitors.

Concretely, the image translation module is learned only with the unpaired cross-spectral data, and the feature extraction module is learned with an input image and its translated image. By learning two modules simultaneously, the image translation module generates the translated image that preserves not only the domain-specific attributes with separate latent spaces but also the domain-agnostic contents with feature consistency constraint. In an inference phase, the cross-spectral feature similarity is augmented by intra-spectral similarities between the features extracted from the translated images. Experimental results show that this model outperforms the state-of-the-art unpaired image translation methods and cross-spectral feature descriptors on various visible and infrared benchmarks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Top-down saliency detection aims to highlight the regions of a specific object category, and typically relies on pixel-wise annotated training data. In this paper, we address the high cost of collecting such training data by a weakly supervised approach to object saliency detection, where only image-level labels, indicating the presence or absence of a target object in an image, are available. The proposed framework is composed of two collaborative CNN modules, an image-level classifier and a pixel-level map generator. While the former distinguishes images with objects of interest from the rest, the latter is learned to generate saliency maps by which the images masked by the maps can be better predicted by the former. In addition to the top-down guidance from class labels, the map generator is derived by also exploring other cues, including the background prior, superpixel- and object proposal-based evidence. The background prior is introduced to reduce false positives. Evidence from superpixels helps preserve sharp object boundaries. The clue from object proposals improves the integrity of highlighted objects. These different types of cues greatly regularize the training process and reduces the risk of overfitting, which happens frequently when learning CNN models with few training data. Experiments show that our method achieves superior results, even outperforming fully supervised methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly empowering people with an interconnected world of physical objects ranging from smart buildings to portable smart devices, such as wearables. With recent advances in mobile sensing, wearables have become a rich collection of portable sensors and are able to provide various types of services, including tracking of health and fitness, making financial transactions, and unlocking smart locks and vehicles. Most of these services are delivered based on users' confidential and personal data, which are stored on these wearables. Existing explicit authentication approaches (i.e., PINs or pattern locks) for wearables suffer from several limitations, including small or no displays, risk of shoulder surfing, and users' recall burden. Oftentimes, users completely disable security features out of convenience. Therefore, there is a need for a burden-free (implicit) authentication mechanism for wearable device users based on easily obtainable biometric data. In this paper, we present an implicit wearable device user authentication mechanism using combinations of three types of coarse-grain minute-level biometrics: behavioral (step counts), physiological (heart rate), and hybrid (calorie burn and metabolic equivalent of task). From our analysis of over 400 Fitbit users from a 17-month long health study, we are able to authenticate subjects with average accuracy values of around .93 (sedentary) and .90 (non-sedentary) with equal error rates of .05 using binary SVM classifiers. Our findings also show that the hybrid biometrics perform better than other biometrics and behavioral biometrics do not have a significant impact, even during non-sedentary periods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In cyberspace, evolutionary strategies are commonly used by both attackers and defenders. For example, an attacker's strategy often changes over the course of time, as new vulnerabilities are discovered and/or mitigated. Similarly, a defender's strategy changes over time. These changes may or may not be in direct response to a change in the opponent's strategy. In any case, it is important to have a set of quantitative metrics to characterize and understand the effectiveness of attackers' and defenders' evolutionary strategies, which reflect their cyber agility. Despite its clear importance, few systematic metrics have been developed to quantify the cyber agility of attackers and defenders. In this paper, we propose the first metric framework for measuring cyber agility in terms of the effectiveness of the dynamic evolution of cyber attacks and defenses. The proposed framework is generic and applicable to transform any relevant, quantitative, and/or conventional static security metrics (e.g., false positives and false negatives) into dynamic metrics to capture dynamics of system behaviors. In order to validate the usefulness of the proposed framework, we conduct case studies on measuring the evolution of cyber attacks and defenses using two real-world datasets. We discuss the limitations of the current work and identify future research directions.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Participatory sensing is a crowdsourcing-based framework, where the platform executes the sensing requests with the help of many common peoples&#x2019; handheld devices (typically smartphones). In this paper, we mainly address the online sensing request admission and smartphone selection problem to maximize the profit of the platform, taking into account the queue backlog, and the location of sensing requests and smartphones. First, we formulate this problem as a discrete time model and design a location aware online admission and selection control algorithm (LAAS) based on the Lyapunov optimization technique. The LAAS algorithm only depends on the currently available information and makes all the control decisions independently and simultaneously. Next, we utilize the recent advancement of the accurate prediction of smartphones&#x2019; mobility and sensing request arrival information in the next few time slots and develop a predictive location aware admission and selection control algorithm (PLAAS). We further design a greedy predictive location aware admission and selection control algorithm (GPLAAS) to achieve the online implementation of PLAAS approximately and iteratively. Theoretical analysis shows that under any control parameter V &gt; 0, both LAAS and PLAAS algorithm can achieve O(1&#x002f;V)-optimal average profit, while the sensing request backlog is bounded by O(V). Extensive numerical results based on both synthetic and real trace show that LAAS outperforms the Greedy algorithm and Random algorithm and GPLAAS improves the profit-backlog tradeoff over LAAS.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents an energy management method to optimally control the energy supply and the temperature settings of distributed heating and ventilation systems for residential buildings. The control model attempts to schedule the supply and demand simultaneously with the purpose of minimizing the total costs. Moreover, the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) model is introduced into the consumers&#x2019; cost functions and the quadratic fitting method is applied to simplify the PPD model. An energy management algorithm is developed to seek the optimal temperature settings, the energy supply, and the price. Furthermore, due to the ubiquity of price oscillations in electricity markets, we analyze and examine the effects of price oscillations on the performance of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the theoretical analysis and simulation results both demonstrate that the proposed energy management algorithm with price oscillations can converge to a region around the optimal solution.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The deployment of smart hybrid heat pumps (SHHPs) can introduce considerable benefits to electricity systems via smart switching between electricity and gas while minimizing the total heating cost for each individual customer. In particular, the fully optimized control technology can provide flexible heat that redistributes the heat demand across time for improving the utilization of low-carbon generation and enhancing the overall energy efficiency of the heating system. To this end, an accurate quantification of the preheating is of great importance to characterize the flexible heat. This paper proposes a novel data-driven preheating quantification method to estimate the capability of the heat pump demand shifting and isolate the effect of interventions. Varieties of fine-grained data from a real-world trial are exploited to estimate the baseline heat demand using Bayesian deep learning while jointly considering epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. A comprehensive range of case studies are carried out to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed quantification method, and then, the estimated demand shift is used as an input into the whole-system model to investigate the system implications and quantify the range of benefits of rolling out the SHHPs developed by PassivSystems to the future GB electricity systems.

<p>Obtaining an appropriate model is very crucial to develop an efficient energy management system for the smart home, including photovoltaic (PV) array, plug-in electric vehicle (PEV), home loads, and heat pump (HP). Stochastic modeling methods of smart homes explain random parameters and uncertainties of the aforementioned components. In this paper, a concise yet comprehensive analysis and comparison are presented for these techniques. First, modeling methods are implemented to find appropriate and precise forecasting models for PV, PEV, HP, and home load demand. Then, the accuracy of each model is validated by the real measured data. Finally, the pros and cons of each method are discussed and reviewed. The obtained results show the conditions under which the methods can provide a reliable and accurate description of smart home dynamics.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper investigates the residential energy management problems in the power-heat-coupling system. For better solving this issue, based on the novel concept of We-Energy (WE) for energy Internet (EI), this paper proposes a residential WE (R-WE) framework faced by the terminal users who play an important role in renewable energy consumption. Inspired by the full-duplex feature of R-WE, the power and heat supply-demand balance constraints are fulfilled in a regional unit of EI, but it may be inequality constraints for corresponding consumer, producer, or WE operation modes in only one R-WE. The R-WE framework can be classified into four operation modes, which is island mode, consumer mode, producer mode, and WE mode. On this basis, the R-WE models cooperate to achieve the objective of minimizing the operation costs, smoothing out the loads&#x2019; variations, and renewable resource fluctuations. Specifically, the R-WE framework with respect to the heat-power-coupling problem can be solved in the distributed double-consensus algorithm (DDCA), which is designed two sets of consensus algorithms by using four completely different consensus variables to calculate the power and heat multipliers, evaluate the power and heat generations and, thereby, further obtain the power mismatches of electricity and heat. Also, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimal conditions of the proposed DDCA is further proved. Meanwhile, a novel projection operation method for combined heat and power devices is designed to take the infeasible solutions mapped into the feasible region. Finally, the simulation results in different cases further demonstrate that the proposed R-WE frame can be an appropriate method to analyze the terminal consumers and harmonize multienergy producers in the process of constructing EI projects. And an R-WE framework of the campus has experimented with minority loads in island mode.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Clothing and carrying status variations are the two key factors that affect the performance of gait recognition because people usually wear various clothes and carry all kinds of objects, while walking in their daily life. These covariates substantially affect the intensities within conventional gait representations such as gait energy images. Hence, to properly compare a pair of input gait features, an appropriate metric for joint intensity is needed in addition to the conventional spatial metric. We therefore propose a unified joint intensity transformer network for gait recognition that is robust against various clothing and carrying statuses. Specifically, the joint intensity transformer network is a unified deep learning-based architecture containing three parts: a joint intensity metric estimation net, a joint intensity transformer, and a discrimination network. First, the joint intensity metric estimation net uses a well-designed encoder-decoder network to estimate a sample-dependent joint intensity metric for a pair of input gait energy images. Subsequently, a joint intensity transformer module outputs the spatial dissimilarity of two gait energy images using the metric learned by the joint intensity metric estimation net. Third, the discrimination network is a generic convolution neural network for gait recognition. In addition, the joint intensity transformer network is designed with different loss functions depending on the gait recognition task (i.e., a contrastive loss function for the verification task and a triplet loss function for the identification task). The experiments on the world&#x2019;s largest datasets containing various clothing and carrying statuses demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>At present, the fusion of different unimodal biometrics has attracted increasing attention from researchers, who are dedicated to the practical application of biometrics. In this paper, we explored a multi-biometric algorithm that integrates palmprints and dorsal hand veins (DHV). Palmprint recognition has a rather high accuracy and reliability, and the most significant advantage of DHV recognition is the biopsy (Liveness detection). In order to combine the advantages of both and implement the fusion method, deep learning and graph matching were, respectively, introduced to identify palmprint and DHV. Upon using the deep hashing network (DHN), biometric images can be encoded as 128-bit codes. Then, the Hamming distances were used to represent the similarity of two codes. Biometric graph matching (BGM) can obtain three discriminative features for classification. In order to improve the accuracy of open-set recognition, in multi-modal fusion, the score-level fusion of DHN and BGM was performed and authentication was provided by support vector machine (SVM). Furthermore, based on DHN, all four levels of fusion strategies were used for multi-modal recognition of palmprint and DHV. Evaluation experiments and comprehensive comparisons were conducted on various commonly used datasets, and the promising results were obtained in this case where the equal error rates (EERs) of both palmprint recognition and multi-biometrics equal 0, demonstrating the great superiority of DHN in biometric verification.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>For the five-phase permanent magnet (PM) machines with conventional Halbach array rotor, although the third harmonic current is injected into the phase current, the torque density hardly increases due to the absence of the third harmonic air gap flux density. Hence, a Halbach array considering third harmonic air gap flux density is proposed in this paper, and the topology is described and compared with the conventional Halbach array. The magnetizing angle of the proposed Halbach array and the stator teeth width are optimized based on the nonlinear programing method. The electromagnetic performances of the five-phase PM machines with the proposed Halbach array, including open-circuit flux density, back electromotive force, flux density under the rated load, cogging torque, average torque, torque ripple, loss, and efficiency, are compared with the PM machine with conventional Halbach array by finite-element method. It is demonstrated that the torque density and efficiency of the PM machine with the proposed Halbach array are higher than that of the PM machine with conventional Halbach array. Finally, the five-phase 10-slot&#x002f;8-pole PM machines with proposed Halbach array is manufactured and tested to verify the analysis.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>AC&#x2013;DC light-emitting diode (LED) drivers suffer from short lifetime because of the low-lifetime electrolytic capacitors used for dc bus decoupling. In this paper, a primary-side peak current control method applied for driving a two-stage multichannel LED driver is proposed. The LED driver consists of an ac&#x2013;dc boost power factor correction stage and an isolated dc&#x2013;dc nonresonant stage. A long-lifetime and small film capacitor is used for implementing the intermediate dc bus. The proposed method, which controls the peak value of the primary-side current of the transformers, is applied to the dc&#x2013;dc stage to ensure constant dc current output of LEDs in spite of the widely varying dc bus voltage due to low bus capacitance. The proposed method compensates the effect of the large dc bus voltage ripple by varying the switching frequency of the primary-side switches. Detailed design procedure, theoretical analysis, and experimental results of the LED driver operating at 180 W with the proposed method are provided. The LED driver with the proposed control method is proved to have high overall efficiency.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The objective of this paper is to develop a method for assisting users to push power-assisted wheelchairs (PAWs) in such a way that the electrical energy consumption over a predefined distance-to-go is optimal, while at the same time bringing users to a desired fatigue level. This assistive task is formulated as an optimal control problem and solved by Feng et al. using the model-free approach gradient of partially observable Markov decision processes. To increase the data efficiency of the model-free framework, we here propose to use policy learning by weighting exploration with the returns (PoWER) with 25 control parameters. Moreover, we provide a new near-optimality analysis of the finite-horizon fuzzy Q-iteration, which derives a model-based baseline solution to verify numerically the near-optimality of the presented model-free approaches. Simulation results show that the PoWER algorithm with the new parameterization converges to a near-optimal solution within 200 trials and possesses the adaptability to cope with changes of the human fatigue dynamics. Finally, 24 experimental trials are carried out on the PAW system, with fatigue feedback provided by the user via a joystick. The performance tends to increase gradually after learning. The results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness and the feasibility of PoWER in our application.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent years have witnessed the promising future of hashing in the industrial applications for fast similarity retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised hashing method for large-scale cross-media search, termed self-supervised deep multimodal hashing (SSDMH), which learns unified hash codes as well as deep hash functions for different modalities in a self-supervised manner. With the proposed regularized binary latent model, unified binary codes can be solved directly without relaxation strategy while retaining the neighborhood structures by the graph regularization term. Moreover, we propose a new discrete optimization solution, termed as binary gradient descent, which aims at improving the optimization efficiency toward real-time operation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets demonstrate the superiority of SSDMH over state-of-the-art cross-media hashing approaches.
