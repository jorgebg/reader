<p>The American Lung Association's State of the Air report, released on April 24, highlights that more than 40% of US citizens&#8212;more than 141 million people&#8212;live in areas with unhealthy levels of ozone and particulate matter. Deteriorating air quality marks an alarming trend for a country that has reduced emissions of common pollutants since the 1980s. Wildfires and heatwaves in parts of the country most affected by climate change have driven record-breaking levels of pollutants in some of the most densely populated cities.

<p>Before the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibition therapy targeting programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) ligand (PD-L1), either given as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer was uniformly fatal. These drugs have changed the treatment landscape for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Long-term results from studies of single-agent nivolumab1 and pembrolizumab2 have shown disease control in approximately 15% of unselected patients. In the pivotal KEYNOTE-024 study,3 treatment-naive patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer and a PD-L1 tumour proportion score (TPS) of 50% or greater were randomly assigned to receive either pembrolizumab as monotherapy or platinum-doublet chemotherapy.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Thanks to the favorable advantage of low cost, integrated three-port dc&#x2013;dc converters with reduced switches have attracted extensive attention. In order to provide more new topologies, this paper aims to propose a programmable topology derivation method, which effectively simplifies the cumbersome process of the conventional combination method. Instead of the manual connection and examination, the proposed alternative can quickly and rigorously derive multiple viable integrated three-port dc&#x2013;dc topologies from a great number of possible connections with the aid of computer program. Besides, generalized analysis is also accomplished, with which performance characteristics of all derived converters are simultaneously obtained and then a comprehensive comparison can be easily conducted to select a preferred one for the practical application. Finally, an example-specific application with one input and two outputs is given, with topology selection, design, and experimental results demonstrated in detail.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A high-speed squirrel-cage induction machine requires a totally different design compared to the traditional squirrel-cage industrial motor because of the mechanical limitations caused by the high speed. This results in a more complicated rotor construction and expensive material selection, and sets higher standards for the manufacturing precision. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the design aspects, material selection, and manufacturing of a squirrel-cage rotor for high-speed applications. In this paper, the rotor dimensioning approach based on equations and data analysis is presented. Rotor material selection and construction topology influence on the electrical machine design are discussed. The results are illustrated with the design of a 6-kW, 120&#x00a0;000-r/min induction machine for a turbo circulator. The influence of rotor parameters on the electromagnetic performance of the designed machine is demonstrated. Mechanical stresses for different topologies are studied with finite-element method analysis. Several manufacturing methods for producing a high-precision rotor are described and compared. The presented rotor design approach, which enables high electromagnetic performance and robust construction, is verified by the testing of a prototype.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The nonlinear state-space dynamical model of the drive train of large-scale wind turbine systems (WTSs) and its scaling for small-scale real-time WTS emulation in the laboratory are discussed in this paper. Shaft elasticity and the nonlinear, aerodynamical turbine torque are considered. To allow for a physically reasonable emulation of the dynamical behavior of multimegawatt wind turbine drive trains at a small-scale laboratory test bench, a general scaling method is presented, which is based on the ratios of physical SI-units. Furthermore, inertia emulation, elasticity emulation, and friction compensation are addressed and possible implementations are proposed. Simulation results of the full-scale WTS model and measurement results of the small-scale real-time WTS emulation are compared to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scaling.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Aluminum electrolytic capacitors (AECs) are connected in a bank to meet the requirement of capacitance, voltage, and current rating for dc-link of power electronic converters. The performance of capacitor bank deteriorates with time due to the degradation of AECs in the bank. Further, each AEC in the bank degrades differently based on its core temperature, which in turn depends on the current and its equivalent series resistance (ESR). Therefore, health monitoring of a bank would require monitoring of individual AECs in the bank. However, extending the available literature on health monitoring of an AEC to the capacitor bank would require voltage/current sensors for individual AECs. To address the aforementioned issue, this paper suggests a method to assess the health of individual AECs online in the bank without using sensors for each AECs. The proposed method involves estimation of current through each capacitor, which is used to determine the core temperature by using a thermal model of AEC. The core temperature is used for estimation of ESR and capacitance of each capacitor using physics-of-failure based degradation model. For the consistent matching of the degradation model to the actual degradation of the capacitor, the coefficients of the model are sequentially updated. For updating, an algorithm based on extended Kalman filter is used. The proposed scheme is experimentally validated on laboratory prototype of single-phase, grid-connected solar PV inverter under variable load conditions.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a novel method to estimate the number of shorted turns in a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) following the detection of interturn short-circuit (ITSC) fault and its location. In this proposed method, PMSM is excited through a low sinusoidal voltage at standstill condition to obtain the winding resistance and synchronous inductance by current response. It is shown that the ITSC fault introduces variation in the current response, which can be used to calculate the number of shorted turns under zero fault resistance assumption. Using this practical procedure, the fault severity can be estimated directly in a straight-forward manner. In other words, the severity estimation for a given machine can be done without complex machine modeling or experiments on ITSC prototype with multiple taps. The findings in this paper are essential for a comprehensive solution including fault mitigation algorithms and postfault operations. In order to verify the findings, a three-phase equivalent circuit model supported by finite element analysis results is used to take saturation and space harmonics into account. In addition, experimental results are presented to demonstrate the validity and practicability of the severity estimation.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Transmission is crucial for big data analysis and learning in industrial Internet of Things (IoT) systems. To transmit data with limited energy is a challenge. This paper studies the problem of data transmission in energy harvesting systems with capacitor to supply energy where the energy receiving rate varies over time. The energy receiving rate is slower when the capacitor receives more energy. Based on this characteristic, we study the problem of how to transmit more data when the energy receiving time is not continuous. Given many packets that arrive at different time instances, there is a tradeoff between transmitting the packet right now or saving the energy to transmit the future arriving packets. We formalize two types of problems. The first one is how to minimize the total completion time when there is enough energy to transmit all the packets. The second one is how to transmit as many packets as possible when the energy is not enough to transmit all the packets. For the first problem, we give a 1 + &#x03b1; approximation off line algorithm when all the information of the packets and the energy receiving periods is known in advance, and a max{2, &#x03b2;} competitive ratio online algorithm where the information is not known in advance. For the second problem, we study three cases and give a 6 + [h/(b/R)] approximation off line algorithm for the general situation. We also prove that there does not exit a constant competitive ratio online algorithm.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deception plays critical roles in economics and technology, especially in emerging interactions in cyberspace. Holistic models of deception are needed in order to analyze interactions and to design mechanisms that improve them. Game theory provides such models. In particular, existing work models deception using signaling games. But signaling games inherently model deception that is undetectable. In this paper, we extend signaling games by including a detector that gives off probabilistic warnings when the sender acts deceptively. Then, we derive pooling and partially separating equilibria of the game. We find that: 1) high quality detectors eliminate some pure-strategy equilibria; 2) detectors with high true-positive rates encourage more honest signaling than detectors with low false-positive rates; 3) receivers obtain optimal outcomes for equal-error-rate detectors; and 4) surprisingly, deceptive senders sometimes benefit from highly accurate deception detectors. We illustrate these results with an application to defensive deception for network security. Our results provide a quantitative and rigorous analysis of the fundamental aspects of detectable deception.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The detection of rescaling operations represents an important task in multimedia forensics. While many effective heuristics have been proposed, there is no theory on the forensic detectability revealing the conditions of more or less reliable detection. We study the problem of discriminating 1D and 2D genuine signals from signals that have been downscaled with the goal of quantifying the statistical distinguishability between these two hypotheses. This is done by assuming known signal models and deriving the expressions of statistical distances that are linked to the hypothesis testing theory, namely, the symmetrized form of Kullback&#x2013;Leibler divergence known as the Jeffreys divergence, and the Bhattacharyya divergence. The analysis is performed for varying parameters of both the genuine signal model (variance and one-step correlation) and the rescaling process (rescaling factor, interpolation kernel, grid shift, and anti-alias filter), thus allowing us to reveal the insights on their influence and interplay. In addition to the signal itself, we consider the signal transformations (prefilter and covariance matrix estimators) that are often involved in practical rescaling detectors, showing that they yield similar results in terms of distinguishability. Numerical tests on synthetic and real signals confirm the main observations from the theoretical analysis.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the rapid development of deep learning, deep hashing methods have achieved promising results in efficient information retrieval. The hashing method maps similar data to binary hashcodes with smaller hamming distance, which has received broad attention due to its low storage cost and fast retrieval speed. Most of the existing deep hashing methods adopt pairwise or triplet losses to deal with similarities underlying the data, but their training is difficult and less efficient because  $O(n^{2})$  data pairs and  $O(n^{3})$  triplets are involved. To address these issues, we propose a novel deep hashing algorithm with the unary loss which can be trained very efficiently. First, we introduce a Unary Upper Bound of the traditional triplet loss, thus reducing the complexity to  $O(n)$  and bridging the classification-based unary loss and the triplet loss. Second, we propose a novel Semantic Cluster Deep Hashing (SCDH) algorithm by introducing a modified Unary Upper Bound loss, called Semantic Cluster Unary Loss. The resultant hashcodes form several compact clusters, which means the hashcodes in the same cluster have similar semantic information. We also demonstrate that the proposed SCDH is easy to extend to semi-supervised settings by incorporating the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning algorithms. The experiments on large-scale datasets show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art hashing algorithms.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Supervised hashing methods have achieved more promising results than unsupervised ones by leveraging label information to generate compact and accurate hash codes. Most of the prior supervised hashing methods construct an  $ntimes n$  instance-pairwise similarity matrix, where  $n$  is the number of training samples. Nevertheless, this kind of similarity matrix results in high memory space cost and makes the optimization time-consuming, making it unacceptable in many real applications. In addition, most of the methods relax the discrete constraints to solve the optimization problem, which may cause large quantization errors and finally lead to poor performance. To address these limitations, in this paper, we present a novel hashing method, named discrete hashing with multiple supervision (MSDH). MSDH supervises the hash code learning with both class-wise and instance-class similarity matrices, whose space cost is much less than the instance-pairwise similarity matrix. With multiple supervision information, better hash codes can be learned. Besides, an iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to directly learn the discrete hash codes instead of relaxing the binary constraints. Experimental results on several widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSDH outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Cross-camera label estimation from a set of unlabeled training data is an extremely important component in the unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) systems. With the estimated labels, the existing advanced supervised learning methods can be leveraged to learn discriminative re-ID models. In this paper, we utilize the graph matching technique for accurate label estimation due to its advantages in optimal global matching and intra-camera relationship mining. However, the graph structure constructed with non-learned similarity measurement cannot handle the large cross-camera variations, which leads to noisy and inaccurate label outputs. This paper designs a dynamic graph matching (DGM) framework, which improves the label estimation process by iteratively refining the graph structure with better similarity measurement learned from the intermediate estimated labels. In addition, we design a positive re-weighting strategy to refine the intermediate labels, which enhances the robustness against inaccurate matching output and noisy initial training data. To fully utilize the abundant video information and reduce false matchings, a co-matching strategy is further incorporated into the framework. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three video benchmarks demonstrate that DGM outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods and yields the competitive performance to fully supervised upper bounds.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Almost all conventional template-matching methods employ low-level image features to measure the similarity between a template image and a scene image using similarity measures, such as pixel intensity and pixel gradient. Although these methods have been widely used in many applications, they cannot simultaneously address all types of robustness challenges. In this paper, with the goal of simultaneously addressing the various challenges, we present a robust semantic template-matching (RSTM) approach. Inspired by the local binary descriptor, we propose a novel superpixel region binary descriptor (SRBD) to construct a multilevel semantic fusion feature vector for RSTM. SRBD uses a new kernel-distance-based simple linear iterative clustering method to extract the stable superpixels from the template image. Then, based on the average intensity difference between each superpixel region and its neighbors, the dominant gradient orientation of each superpixel can be obtained, and the semantic features of each superpixel can be described as the dominant orientation difference vector, which is coded as the rotation-invariant SRBD. In the offline matching phase, the fusion semantic feature vector of RSTM combines the multilevel SRBD features with different numbers of superpixels. In the online matching phase, to cope with rotation invariance, a marginal probability model is proposed and applied to locate the positions of template images in the scene image. Moreover, to accelerate computation, an image pyramid is employed. We conduct a series of experiments on a large dataset randomly selected from the MS COCO dataset to fully analyze the robustness of this approach. The experimental results show that RSTM simultaneously addresses rotation changes, scale changes, noise, occlusions, blur, nonlinear illumination changes, and deformation with high time efficiency while also outperforming the previous state-of-the-art template-matching methods.

<p>As the problem of three-phase unbalance in a distribution network with distributed generations (DGs) is prominent, a multiobjective dynamic reconfiguration method for three-phase balance is proposed to make reconfiguration more reasonable and effective. Based on three-phase power flow calculation and reconfiguration process analysis of distribution networks with DGs, a new reconfiguration model with comprehensive optimization objectives of minimizing three-phase unbalance factor and number of switching times are established. A network connectivity discrimination method based on the algebraic connectivity of graph theory is adopted to quickly remove infeasible solutions, and a new multiobjective molecular differential evolution algorithm is designed to improve optimization depth and avoid prematurity in the optimization process, which is based on the principle of closer molecules with greater intermolecular repulsion. The multiobjective optimal dynamic reconfiguration of a modified IEEE 34-bus test feeder with DGs is carried out and the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

<p>In this paper, an output feedback finite-time control method is investigated for stabilizing the perturbed vehicle active suspension system to improve the suspension performance. Since physical suspension systems always exist in the phenomenon of uncertainty or external disturbance, a novel disturbance compensator with finite-time convergence performance is proposed for efficiently compensating the unknown external disturbance. Moreover, the presented compensator is advantageous over the existing ones since it is continuous and can completely remove the matched disturbance. From the viewpoint of practical implementation, continuous control law will not lead to chattering, which is desirable for electrical and mechanical systems. For the nominal suspension system without disturbance, a homogeneous controller with a simple filter is constructed to achieve a finite-time convergence property, where the filter is applied to obtain the unknown velocity signal. Thus, the nominal controller combines a disturbance compensator into an overall continuous control law, which provides two independent parts with a separate design unit and a high flexibility for selecting the control gains. According to the geometric homogeneity and finite-time separation principle, it can be shown that the active suspension is finite-time stabilized. A designed example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented controller for improving the vehicle ride performance.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In actual production processes, the occurrence probability of multiple faults is much higher than that of a single fault, which will affect the process industry operating performance and final products quality. This paper is concerned with industrial practices and theoretical approaches for detection and location of key performance indicator (KPI) related multiple faults in process industries. First, a new KPI-related multiple fault monitoring scheme is addressed from the subprocess level based on the developed correlation-based canonical variable analysis model. Then, Bayesian fusion is implemented to form the final monitoring decisions from the plantwide level. After that, a tensor subspace analysis-based discriminant analysis method is proposed for locating the root causes, which will help field engineers to take correction actions and recover the process operations. Finally, the application to a typical industry process, i.e., hot strip mill process, is given to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed methods with real industrial data.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep computation, as an advanced machine learning model, has achieved the state-of-the-art performance for feature learning on big data in industrial Internet of Things (IoT). However, the current deep computation model usually suffers from overfitting due to the lack of public available labeled training samples, limiting its performance for big data feature learning. Motivated by the idea of active learning, an adaptive dropout deep computation model (ADDCM) with crowdsourcing to cloud is proposed for industrial IoT big data feature learning in this paper. First, a distribution function is designed to set the dropout rate for each hidden layer to prevent overfitting for the deep computation model. Furthermore, the outsourcing selection algorithm based on the maximum entropy is employed to choose appropriate samples from the training set to crowdsource on the cloud platform. Finally, an improved supervised learning from multiple experts scheme is presented to aggregate answers given by human workers and to update the parameters of the ADDCM simultaneously. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the presented model by comparing with the dropout deep computation model and other state-of-the-art crowdsourcing algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can prevent overfitting effectively and aggregate the labeled samples to train the parameters of the deep computation model with crowdsouring for industrial IoT big data feature learning.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Digital reconstruction of mechanically shredded documents has received increasing attention in the last years mainly for historical and forensics needs. Computational methods to solve this problem are highly desirable in order to mitigate the time-consuming human effort and to preserve document integrity. The reconstruction of strips-shredded documents is accomplished by horizontally splicing pieces so that the arising sequence (solution) is as similar as the original document. In this context, a central issue is the quantification of the fitting between the pieces (strips), which generally involves stating a function that associates a pair of strips to a real value indicating the fitting quality. This problem is also more challenging for text documents, such as business letters or legal documents, since they depict poor color information. The system proposed here addresses this issue by exploring character shapes as visual features for compatibility computation. Experiments conducted with real mechanically shredded documents showed that our approach outperformed in accuracy other popular techniques in the literature considering documents with (almost) only textual content.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The connected vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) and cloud computing technology allows entities in VANET to enjoy the advantageous storage and computing services offered by some cloud service provider. However, the advantages do not come free, since their combination brings many new security and privacy requirements for VANET applications. In this paper, we investigate the cloud-based road condition monitoring (RCoM) scenario, where the authority needs to monitor real-time road conditions with the help of a cloud server so that it could make sound responses to emergency cases timely. When some bad road condition is detected, e.g., some geologic hazard or accident happens, vehicles on site are able to report such information to a cloud server engaged by the authority. We focus on addressing three key issues in RCoM. First, the vehicles have to be authorized by some roadside unit before generating a road condition report in the domain and uploading it to the cloud server. Second, to guarantee the privacy against the cloud server, the road condition information should be reported in ciphertext format, which requires that the cloud server should be able to distinguish the reported data from different vehicles in ciphertext format for the same place without compromising their confidentiality. Third, the cloud server and authority should be able to validate the report source, i.e., to check whether the road conditions are reported by legitimate vehicles. To address these issues, we present an efficient RCoM scheme, analyze its efficiency theoretically, and demonstrate the practicality through experiments.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The task of Heterogeneous Face Recognition consists in matching face images that are sensed in different domains, such as sketches to photographs (visual spectra images), and thermal images to photographs or near-infrared images to photographs. In this paper, we suggest that the high-level features of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks trained in visual spectra images are potentially domain independent and can be used to encode faces sensed in different image domains. A generic framework for Heterogeneous Face Recognition is proposed by adapting Deep Convolutional Neural Networks low-level features in, so-called, Domain Specific Units. The adaptation using the Domain Specific Units allows the learning of shallow feature detectors specific for each new image domain. Furthermore, it handles its transformation to a generic face space shared between all image domains. Experiments carried out with four different face databases covering three different image domains show substantial improvements, in terms of recognition rate, surpassing the state-of-the-art for most of them. This work is made reproducible: all the source code, scores, and trained models of this approach are made publicly available.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fractional-pel accurate motion is widely used in video coding. For subband coding, fractional-pel accuracy is challenging since it is difficult to handle the complex motion field with temporal transforms. In our previous work, we designed integer accurate motion-adaptive transforms (MAT) which can transform integer accurate motion-connected coefficients. In this paper, we extend the integer MAT to fractional-pel accuracy. The integer MAT allows only one reference coefficient to be the lowband coefficient. In this paper, we design the transform such that it permits multiple references and generates multiple lowband coefficients. In addition, our fractional-pel MAT can incorporate a general interpolation filter into the basis vector, such that the highband coefficient produced by the transform is the same as the prediction error from the interpolation filter. The fractional-pel MAT is always orthonormal. Thus, the energy is preserved by the transform. We compare the proposed fractional-pel MAT, the integer MAT, and the half-pel motion-compensated orthogonal transform (MCOT), while HEVC intra coding is used to encode the temporal subbands. The experimental results show that the proposed fractional-pel MAT outperforms the integer MAT and the half-pel MCOT. The gain achieved by the proposed MAT over the integer MAT can reach up to 1 dB in PSNR.
