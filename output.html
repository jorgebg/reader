<p>We welcome the important and timely viewpoint by Sharon Fonn and colleagues1 about the challenges and potential solutions for increasing knowledge production in Africa. We would like to highlight the role of research collaboration and partnership at the individual (micro) level as an additional source of knowledge production in Africa. An example is the twin-PhD model, which invests in individual researchers by twinning doctoral students.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Seeing a health professional for a full health screening - even when you feel healthy -- from around age 40 enables people to make changes when problems first set in, experts say. Flinders University research on a group of 561 seemingly healthy adults found that there was an average of five unidentified health problems per person, including undiagnosed blood pressure or early hearing loss. The 21 health domains tested hearing, memory, lung function, foot sensation, balance, diet and physical activity.

<p>People who have been tortured while in detention are among our most vulnerable patients. Clinicians who care for these patients might likewise feel vulnerable and ill-equipped to manage the complex health-care needs of victims. Torture and detention on their own have health impacts, but together exact a physical and psychological toll on individuals that can be long-lasting and profound. A third of asylum seekers and over 40% of refugees are estimated to be victims of torture. That health-care delivery can trigger memories of trauma, fear of officials, and mistrust of institutions compounds the challenges clinicians face in caring for people who have been tortured in detention.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Spectrum auction is an effective approach to improve the spectrum utilization, by leasing an idle spectrum from primary users to secondary users. Recently, a few differentially private spectrum auction mechanisms have been proposed, but, as far as we know, none of them addressed the differential privacy in the setting of double spectrum auctions. In this paper, we combine the concept of differential privacy with double spectrum auction design and present a differentially private double spectrum auction mechanism with approximate social welfare maximization (DDSM). Specifically, we design the mechanism by employing the exponential mechanism to select clearing prices for the double spectrum auction with probabilities exponentially proportional to the related social welfare values and then improve the mechanism in several aspects, such as the designs of the auction algorithm, the utility function, and the buyer grouping algorithm. Through theoretical analysis, we prove that DDSM achieves differential privacy, approximate truthfulness, and approximate social welfare maximization. Extensive experimental evaluations show that DDSM achieves a good performance in terms of social welfare.

The first construction uses random linear codes and achieves all points of the key-leakage-storage regions of the generated-secret and chosen-secret models. The second construction uses nested polar codes for vector quantization during enrollment and for error correction during reconstruction. The simulation results show that the nested polar codes achieve privacy leakage and storage rates that improve on existing code designs. One proposed code achieves a rate tuple that cannot be achieved by existing methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Dynamic software watermarking is one of the major countermeasures against software licensing violations. However, conventional dynamic watermarking approaches have exhibited a number of weaknesses including exploitable payload semantics, exploitable embedding/recognition procedures, and weak correlation between payload and subject software. This paper presents a novel dynamic watermarking method, Xmark, which leverages a well-known unsolved mathematical problem referred to as the Collatz conjecture. Our method works by transforming selected conditional constructs (which originally belonged to the software to be watermarked) with a control flow obfuscation technique based on Collatz conjecture. These obfuscation routines are built in a particular way such that they are able to express a watermark in the form of iteratively executed branching activities occurred during computing the aforementioned conjecture. Exploiting the one-to-one correspondence between natural numbers and their orbits computed by the conjecture (also known as the &#x201c;Hailstone sequences&#x201d;), Xmark&#x2019;s watermark-related activities are designed to be insignificant without the pre-defined secret input. Meanwhile, being integrated with obfuscation techniques, our method is able to resist attacks based on various reverse engineering techniques on both syntax and semantic levels. Analyses and simulations indicated that Xmark could evade detections via pattern matching and model checking, and meanwhile effectively prohibit dynamic symbolic execution. We have also shown that our method could remain robust even if a watermarked software is compromised via re-obfuscation using approaches like control flow flattening.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Microphone recognition aims at recognizing different microphones based on the recorded speeches. In the literature, Gaussian Supervector (GSV) has been used as the feature vector representing a speech recording, which is obtained by adapting a universal background model (UBM). However, it is not clear how the performance of the GSV will be affected by the number of mixture components in the UBM. Besides, the raw GSV obtained from a speech recording contains both the microphone response information and the speech information, meaning that the raw GSV can be quite noisy as the feature vector for microphone recognition. In this paper, we investigate how GSV will be affected by the UBM and other parameters during the calculation of the GSV. In addition, in order to improve the quality of the raw GSV, we propose a kernel-based projection method to be applied to the raw GSV. This projection method maps the raw GSV onto another dimensional space. It is expected that in the projected feature space, the microphone response information and the speech information can be separated into different dimensions, meaning that the projected GSV should be better as the feature vector for microphone recognition compared to the raw GSV. Two classifiers that have been used in the literature, namely linear support vector machine (SVM) and sparse representation-based classifier (SRC), are employed to compare the performance of the raw GSV and the projected GSV. The experimental results demonstrate that the projected GSV can outperform the raw GSV no matter using linear SVM or SRC as the classifier, which shows the effectiveness of the projection method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In public cloud storage services, data are outsourced to semi-trusted cloud servers which are outside of data owners&#x2019; trusted domain. To prevent untrustworthy service providers from accessing data owners&#x2019; sensitive data, outsourced data are often encrypted. In this scenario, conducting access control over these data becomes a challenging issue. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) has been proved to be a powerful cryptographic tool to express access policies over attributes, which can provide a fine-grained, flexible, and secure access control over outsourced data. However, the existing ABE-based access control schemes do not support users to gain access permission by collaboration. In this paper, we explore a special attribute-based access control scenario where multiple users having different attribute sets can collaborate to gain access permission if the data owner allows their collaboration in the access policy. Meanwhile, the collaboration that is not designated in the access policy should be regarded as a collusion and the access request will be denied. We propose an attribute-based controlled collaborative access control scheme through designating translation nodes in the access structure. Security analysis shows that our proposed scheme can guarantee data confidentiality and has many other critical security properties. Extensive performance analysis shows that our proposed scheme is efficient in terms of storage and computation overhead.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Correlation filter (CF)-based trackers have aroused increasing attention in the visual tracking field due to the superior performance on several datasets while maintaining high running speed. For each frame, an ideal filter is trained in order to discriminate the target from its surrounding background. Considering that the target always undergoes external and internal interference during the tracking procedure, the trained tracker should not only have the ability to judge the current state when failure occurs, but also to resist the model drift caused by challenging distractions. To this end, we present a state-aware anti-drift tracker (SAT) in this paper, which jointly models the discrimination and reliability information in filter learning. Specifically, global context patches are incorporated into the filter training stage to better distinguish the target from backgrounds. Meanwhile, a color-based reliable mask is learned to encourage the filter to focus on more reliable regions suitable for tracking. We show that the proposed optimization problem could be efficiently solved using alternative direction method of multipliers and fully carried out in the Fourier domain. Furthermore, a kurtosis-based updating scheme is advocated to reveal the tracking condition as well as guarantee a high-confidence template updating. Extensive experiments are conducted on OTB-100 and UAV-20L datasets to compare the SAT tracker with other relevant state-of-the-art methods. In this paper, both quantitative and qualitative evaluations further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Noise estimation is crucial in many image processing tasks, such as denoising. Most of the existing noise estimation methods are specially developed for grayscale images. For color images, these methods simply handle each color channel independently, without considering the correlation across channels. Moreover, these methods often assume a globally fixed noise model throughout the entire image, neglecting the adaptation to the local structures. In this paper, we propose a content-adaptive multivariate Gaussian approach to model the noise in color images, in which we explicitly consider both the content-dependence and the inter-dependence among color channels. We design an effective method for estimating the noise covariance matrices within the proposed model. Specifically, a patch selection scheme is first introduced to select the weakly textured patches via thresholding the texture strength indicators. Noticing that the patch selection actually depends on the unknown noise covariance, we present an iterative noise covariance estimation algorithm, where the patch selection and the covariance estimation are conducted alternately. For the remaining textured regions, we estimate a distinct covariance matrix associated with each pixel using a linear shrinkage estimator, which adaptively fuses the estimate coming from the weakly textured region and the sample covariance estimated from the local region. The experimental results show that our method can effectively estimate the noise covariance. The usefulness of our method is demonstrated with several image processing applications, such as color image denoising and noise-robust superpixel.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents an improved pulsewidth modulation strategy in conjunction with an optimal compensator for fast capacitor voltage balancing in three-level neutral-point-clamped (NPC) inverter. The voltage balancing compensator is designed in such a way that it produces optimal unbalance compensation coefficient according to the inherent limitations related to the variability range of modulating signals. It generates maximum compensating neutral current for the full modulation depth extending into overmodulation region and throughout the entire range of load power factor angles, and thus improves the unbalance compensation ability for all the operating conditions of the inverter. The optimal compensation offset signal corresponding to each operating point is determined from the boundary limit of the auxiliary modulating signals. Particle swarm optimization is applied for such purpose. The performance of the proposed optimal compensator for different combinations of modulation index and load power factors are evaluated through extensive simulation study using Matlab/Simulink and validated in experimentation using a three-level NPC inverter prototype with induction motor load. Finally, the voltage balancing performances of the proposed compensator are compared with that available in literature to confirm the usefulness of the proposed concept.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The two most commonly used induction motor control methods are the scalar (V/f) and vector (field-oriented) control techniques. V/f control has good steadystate response and robustness against the variation in machine parameters, but the resulting torque dynamics are poorer. Vector control achieves better dynamic performance by decoupling the fluxand torque-producing components of the stator current. Vector-controlled techniques are heavily dependent on the machine parameters and are sensitive to the variation in machine parameters. This paper proposes a novel control technique, which integrates the robustness features of scalar control and good dynamic performance of vector control. Estimation of the transient vector is responsible for improving dynamics in the proposed control. The proposed control technique uses an optimal controller with an output feedback law. The operation of the proposed control is validated experimentally under both steady-state and transient conditions. Finally, the proposed control is compared with both the V/f and vector control strategies in terms of dynamic performance and parameter sensitivity.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Skeleton-based human action recognition has been a hot topic in recent years. Most existing studies are based on the skeleton data obtained from Kinect, which is noisy and unstable, in particular, in the case of occlusions. To cope with the noisy skeleton data and variation of viewpoints, this paper presents a view-invariant method for human action recognition by recovering the corrupted skeletons based on a 3D bio-constrained skeleton model and visualizing those body-level motion features obtained during the recovery process with images. The bio-constrained skeleton model is defined with two types of constraints: 1) constant bone lengths and 2) motion limits of joints. Based on the bio-constrained model, an effective method is proposed for skeleton recovery. Two types of new motion features, the Euclidean distance matrix between joints (JEDM), which contains the global structure information of the body, and the local dynamic variation of the joint Euler angles (JEAs) are used in describing human action. These two types of features are encoded into different motion images, which are fed into a two-stream convolutional neural network for learning different action patterns. The experiments on three benchmark datasets achieve better accuracy than the state-of-the-art approaches, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel algorithm to reassemble an arbitrarily shredded image to its original status. Existing reassembly pipelines commonly consist of a local matching stage and a global compositions stage. In the local stage, a key challenge is to reliably compute correct pairwise matching, for which most existing algorithms use handcrafted features, and cannot reliably handle complicated puzzles. We build a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect the compatibility of pairwise stitching, and use it to prune computed pairwise matches. To improve the network efficiency and accuracy, we transfer the calculation of CNN to the stitching region and apply a boost training strategy. In the global composition stage, instead of using the widely adopted greedy edge selection strategies, we propose two new loop closure-based searching algorithms. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods on solving various puzzles, especially challenging ones with many fragment pieces.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deblurring is a fundamental inverse problem in bioimaging. It requires modeling the point spread function (PSF), which captures the optical distortions entailed by the image formation process. The PSF limits the spatial resolution attainable for a given microscope. However, recent applications require a higher resolution and have prompted the development of super-resolution techniques to achieve sub-pixel accuracy. This requirement restricts the class of suitable PSF models to analog ones. In addition, deblurring is computationally intensive, hence further requiring computationally efficient models. A custom candidate fitting both the requirements is the Gaussian model. However, this model cannot capture the rich tail structures found in both the theoretical and empirical PSFs. In this paper, we aim at improving the reconstruction accuracy beyond the Gaussian model, while preserving its computational efficiency. We introduce a new class of analog PSF models based on the Gaussian mixtures. The number of Gaussian kernels controls both the modeling accuracy and the computational efficiency of the model: the lower the number of kernels, the lower the accuracy and the higher the efficiency. To explore the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, we propose a variational formulation of the PSF calibration problem, where a convex sparsity-inducing penalty on the number of Gaussian kernels allows trading accuracy for efficiency. We derive an efficient algorithm based on a fully split formulation of alternating split Bregman. We assess our framework on synthetic and real data, and demonstrate a better reconstruction accuracy in both geometry and photometry in point source localization&#x2014;a fundamental inverse problem in fluorescence microscopy.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Automated production systems are critical enablers for Industry 4.0 because these design-to-order, custom-built mechatronic systems are not only capable of delivering automation capabilities to satisfy the stakeholder requirements in the manufacturing/production domain, but doing so for a long period of time (e.g., several decades) during which numerous changing needs shall also be accounted for. Although traceability has long been recognized as key to sustain changes, little is known about how the traceability information is managed in place, i.e., in the native environments where the engineering artifacts reside. We contribute in this paper a survey of traceability support within state-of-the-practice tools: seven for programming logic controllers and six for building models in systems modeling language. We draw the similarities and differences from our survey results, and further present a design by leveraging the in-place traceability to better support the development and evolution of automated production systems.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a variable structure speed controller (VSSC) that guarantees the robust transient performance against the external disturbances and parameter uncertainties of an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive. Unlike the conventional VSSC applied to the IPMSMs, the proposed nonlinear compensating control term not only assures the robustness against the system uncertainties, but also implements the maximum torque per ampere technique. Furthermore, the convergence and stability of the proposed VSSC are fully proven through the Lyapunov theory by introducing reasonable bounded uncertainties which determine a feasible range for the system dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is investigated through the simulation using MATLAB/Simulink and experiment using a prototype IPMSM drive system with a TI TMS320F28335 DSP. Finally, the proposed VSSC can ensure faster and more robust transient response than the conventional proportional-integral speed controller under the dynamic load conditions including the uncertainties.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper introduces a novel optimum design of the proportional&#x2013;integral (PI) controller in the power converter circuits using the water cycle algorithm (WCA) to augment the transient stability of a grid-connected wave energy conversion (WEC) system. The proposed system relies on the Archimedes wave swing device, which is coupled with a linear permanent magnet synchronous generator (LPMSG). The WEC system is interfaced with the power grid via a generator-side converter (GSC) and a grid-side inverter (GSI). The GSC is used to control both of the d-axis and q-axis current of the LPMSG to minimize its power losses and extract its maximum real power, respectively. The GSI is implemented to control the terminal voltage at the point of common coupling and the dc-link voltage through a complete vector control scheme. The proposed optimal WCA-based PI control strategy is applied to both converters. The optimization process depends on the simulation-based optimization approach. In the proposed approach, the criterion of integral squared error is chosen as a multiobjective function. To validate the proposed WEC system model, the simulation results are compared with the practical results, and their error reaches less than 1&#x0025;. The effectiveness of the proposed WCA-based PI control strategy is tested and compared with that obtained using the genetic-algorithm-based PI control scheme under symmetrical and unsymmetrical grid fault conditions taking into account a successful and unsuccessful reclosure of circuit breakers. The validity of the proposed control strategy is extensively checked based on simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is revolutionizing the retail industry for manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers to improve operational efficiency and consumer experience. In IIoT-enabled retail marketing, reputation systems play a critical role to boost mutual trust among industrial entities and build consumer confidence. In this paper, we focus on reputation management in the consumer&#x2013;retailer channel, where retailers can accumulate reputations from consumer feedbacks. To encourage consumers to post feedbacks without worrying about being tracked or retaliated, we propose an anonymous reputation system that preserves consumer identities and individual review confidentialities. To increase system transparency and reliability, we further exploit the tamper-proof nature and the distributed consensus mechanism of the blockchain technology. With system designs based on various cryptographic primitives and a Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol, our blockchain-based reputation system is more efficient to offer high levels of privacy guarantees compared with existing ones. Finally, we explore the implementation challenges of the blockchain-based architecture and present a proof-of-concept prototype system by Parity Ethereum. We measure the on/off-chain performance with the scalability discussion to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the automated demand response (DR) problem in smart grids equipped with information and communication technology networks, where power generating and consuming units can exchange information as a multiagent system (MAS), and a real-time pricing (RTP) scheme is proposed. When the communication graph among agents is connected, a novel parallel and distributed consensus-based algorithm is proposed to derive an RTP scheme to facilitate DR, and when communication uncertainties exist, a robust consensus algorithm is proposed to cease the effect of uncertainties. Next, this paper proposes a novel control mechanism to tackle the problem of disconnected communication among agents, e.g., under cyber-attacks, by employing the so-called mixed communication-broadcast control architecture where the underlying ideas are twofold. First, each area in the grid associated with a connected subgraph is controlled by a MAS to guarantee the power balance and to reach consensus on the local electric price for that area. Second, a supervisory unit observes those local electric prices to calculate the global electric price for the whole grid and then broadcasts to all units so that they can properly adjust their output powers. Simulations are carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system to validate the proposed control mechanisms.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper investigates the problem of decentralized fault-tolerant tracking control for nonlinear large-scale systems with sensor and actuator faults. Due to the adverse coupling effects that unknown sensor faults and output interconnections coexist, the previous methods fail to achieve decentralized tracking controls. Focus of this paper is particularly on addressing this issue. First, a decentralized fault-tolerant observer is constructed to simultaneously estimate unmeasured state and compensate the actuator faults. Then, an adaptive signal compensation mechanism is presented to mitigate the effects of sensor faults and output interconnections. By applying the cubic absolute-value Lyapunov function analysis method, it is shown that all the signals are bounded and the tracking error of each subsystem converges to an adjustable neighborhood of zero. An example of a large-scale power system is adopted to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained scheme.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>High control bandwidth is usually restricted in a finite sampling rate of a charge-coupled device (CCD)-based tracking loop, which hinders a good closed-loop performance. Conventionally, a rate feedforward controller is usually used to improve the control performance; however, it is restricted by the line-of-sight (LOS) rate, which is required to be estimated due to only the LOS error available in the CCD-based tracking control system. Besides that, it is also affected by the inverse of the control model. A new error-based feedforward (EBF) control mode is proposed to overcome these difficulties. Due to being plugged into an existing feedback control loop, the closed-loop performance of the CCD-based control system can be minimized by optimizing a Q-filter. The closed-loop stability and robustness with this EBF control system are investigated on the condition of the gain margin and the phase margin of the open-loop transfer function. Furthermore, this paper proposes a new criterion to enhance the robustness of the EBF control system and reveals the sensitivity function property. Because of not being restricted by an accurate model, this new feedforward controller cannot lead to a compromise between error attenuation and noise propagation in the control loop. Simulations and experiments are both used to testify the effectiveness of the improved control mode.
