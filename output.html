<p>An independent review of gross negligence manslaughter (GNM) and culpable homicide, published on June 6, describes how the conduct of the General Medical Council (GMC) relating to the case of Hadiza Bawa-Garba severely damaged its relationship with the doctors it is supposed to regulate. The review acknowledges several serious concerns about the GMC that emerged from this, and other similar, recent cases. These concerns include an over-representation of black and ethnic minority doctors referred to the GMC and a potential conflict in the responsibilities of the GMC both to ensure doctors are safe to practise and to maintain public confidence in the profession.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Active contour models are one of the most emblematic algorithms of computer vision. Their strong theoretical foundations and high user interoperability turned them into a reference approach for object segmentation and tracking tasks. A high number of modifications have already been proposed in order to overcome the known problems of traditional snakes, such as initialization dependence and poor convergence to concavities. In this paper, we address the scenario where the user wants to segment an object that has multiple dynamic regions but some of them do not correspond to the true object boundary. We propose a novel parametric active contour model, the Sparse Multi-Bending snake, which is capable of dividing the contour into a set of contiguous regions with different bending properties. We derive a new energy function that induces such behavior and presents a group optimization strategy that can be used to find the optimal bending resistance parameter for each point of the contour. We show the flexibility of our model in a set of synthetic images. In addition, we consider two real applications, lung segmentation in Computerized Tomography data and hand segmentation in depth images. We show how the proposed method is able to improve the segmentations obtained in both applications, when compared with other active contour models.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Skeleton-based human action recognition has been a hot topic in recent years. Most existing studies are based on the skeleton data obtained from Kinect, which is noisy and unstable, in particular, in the case of occlusions. To cope with the noisy skeleton data and variation of viewpoints, this paper presents a view-invariant method for human action recognition by recovering the corrupted skeletons based on a 3D bio-constrained skeleton model and visualizing those body-level motion features obtained during the recovery process with images. The bio-constrained skeleton model is defined with two types of constraints: 1) constant bone lengths and 2) motion limits of joints. Based on the bio-constrained model, an effective method is proposed for skeleton recovery. Two types of new motion features, the Euclidean distance matrix between joints (JEDM), which contains the global structure information of the body, and the local dynamic variation of the joint Euler angles (JEAs) are used in describing human action. These two types of features are encoded into different motion images, which are fed into a two-stream convolutional neural network for learning different action patterns. The experiments on three benchmark datasets achieve better accuracy than the state-of-the-art approaches, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Hashing plays a pivotal role in nearest-neighbor searching for large-scale image retrieval. Recently, deep learning-based hashing methods have achieved promising performance. However, most of these deep methods involve discriminative models, which require large-scale, labeled training datasets, thus hindering their real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to exploit the semantic similarity of the training data and design an efficient generative adversarial framework to learn binary hash codes in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, our model consists of three different neural networks: an encoder network to learn hash codes from images, a generative network to generate images from hash codes, and a discriminative network to distinguish between pairs of hash codes and images. By adversarially training these networks, we successfully learn mutually coherent encoder and generative networks, and can output efficient hash codes from the encoder network. We also propose a novel strategy, which utilizes both feature and neighbor similarities, to construct a semantic similarity matrix, then use this matrix to guide the hash code learning process. Integrating the supervision of this semantic similarity matrix into the adversarial learning framework can efficiently preserve the semantic information of training data in Hamming space. The experimental results on three widely used benchmarks show that our method not only significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised hashing methods, but also achieves comparable performance with popular supervised hashing methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to the unpredictable location, fuzzy texture, and diverse shape, accurate segmentation of the kidney tumor in CT images is an important yet challenging task. To this end, we, in this paper, present a cascaded trainable segmentation model termed as Crossbar-Net. Our method combines two novel schemes: 1) we originally proposed the crossbar patches, which consists of two orthogonal non-squared patches (i.e., the vertical patch and horizontal patch). The crossbar patches are able to capture both the global and local appearance information of the kidney tumors from both the vertical and horizontal directions simultaneously. 2) With the obtained crossbar patches, we iteratively train two sub-models (i.e., horizontal sub-model and vertical sub-model) in a cascaded training manner. During the training, the trained sub-models are encouraged to become more focused on the difficult parts of the tumor automatically (i.e., mis-segmented regions). Specifically, the vertical (horizontal) sub-model is required to help segment the mis-segmented regions for the horizontal (vertical) sub-model. Thus, the two sub-models could complement each other to achieve the self-improvement until convergence. In the experiment, we evaluate our method on a real CT kidney tumor dataset which is collected from 94 different patients including 3500 CT slices. Compared with state-of-the-art segmentation methods, the results demonstrate the superior performance of our method on the Dice similarity coefficient, true positive fraction, centroid distance, and Hausdorff distance. Moreover, to exploit the generalization to other segmentation tasks, we also extend our Crossbar-Net to two related segmentation tasks: 1) cardiac segmentation in MR images and 2) breast mass segmentation in X-ray images, showing the promising results for these two tasks. Our implementation is released at https://github.com/Qianyu1226/Crossbar-Net.

<p>We analyze a two-receiver binary-input discrete memoryless broadcast channel, in which the transmitter communicates a common message simultaneously to both receivers and a covert message to only one of them. The unintended recipient of the covert message is treated as an adversary who attempts to detect the covert transmission. This model captures the problem of embedding covert messages in an innocent codebook and generalizes previous covert communication models in which innocent behavior corresponds to the absence of communication between legitimate users. We identify the exact asymptotic behavior of the number of covert bits that can be transmitted when the rate of the innocent codebook is close to the capacity of the channel to the adversary. Our results also identify the dependence of the number of covert bits on the channel parameters and the characteristics of the innocent codebook.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Sparse coding-based anomaly detection has shown promising performance, of which the keys are feature learning, sparse representation, and dictionary learning. In this paper, we propose a new neural network for anomaly detection (termed AnomalyNet) by deeply achieving feature learning, sparse representation, and dictionary learning in three joint neural processing blocks. Specifically, to learn better features, we design a motion fusion block accompanied by a feature transfer block to enjoy the advantages of eliminating noisy background, capturing motion, and alleviating data deficiency. Furthermore, to address some disadvantages (e.g., nonadaptive updating) of the existing sparse coding optimizers and embrace the merits of neural network (e.g., parallel computing), we design a novel recurrent neural network to learn sparse representation and dictionary by proposing an adaptive iterative hard-thresholding algorithm (adaptive ISTA) and reformulating the adaptive ISTA as a new long short-term memory (LSTM). To the best of our knowledge, this could be one of the first works to bridge the  $ell _{1}$ -solver and LSTM and may provide novel insight into understanding LSTM and model-based optimization (or named differentiable programming), as well as sparse coding-based anomaly detection. Extensive experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of our method in the abnormal events detection task.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Gait is a useful biometric feature for human identification in video surveillance applications since it can be obtained without subject cooperation. In recent years, model-based gait recognition using a 3D skeleton has been widely studied through view-invariant modeling and kinematic gait analysis. However, existing methods integrate all frame-level feature vectors using the same criterion, even though skeleton information is highly sensitive to changes in covariate conditions such as clothing, carrying, and occlusion. The scheme inevitably reduces the frame-level discriminative power and eventually degrades performance. Instead, we propose a robust frame-level matching method for gait recognition that minimizes the influence of noisy patterns as well as secures the frame-level discriminative power. To this end, we measure the skeleton quality in terms of body symmetry for each frame. Based on the quality, we construct a quality-adjusted cost matrix between input frames and registered frames to prevent matching with noisy patterns. Our two-stage linear matching is then applied to the cost matrix to compute a frame-level discriminative score including similarity and margin. In the end, the identity of a probe is determined by a weighted majority voting scheme via frame-level scores. It enhances the robustness against inaccurate skeleton estimation results by assigning different weights for each frame based on the score. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets (UPCVgait, UPCVgaitK2, and SDUgait) and a new gait dataset which we create with consideration of unpredictable behaviors while walking. In addition, we demonstrate that our method is robust to skeleton estimation error, partial occlusion, and data loss. The CILgait dataset and MATLAB code are available at https://sites.google.com/site/seokeonchoi/gait-recognition.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a frequency diverse array-based directional modulation with artificial noise synthesis scheme is proposed to enhance the physical layer security of wireless communications. We aim to optimize the secrecy performance by jointly optimizing the frequency offsets, the beamforming vector, and the artificial-noise projection matrix (ANPM). Specifically, we address the physical layer security problems for known locations of proximal eavesdropper (Eve) and legitimate user (LU). The beamforming vector and frequency offsets are designed to preserve the signal power at LU. The ANPM is calculated to minimize the effect of AN on LU. Furthermore, we extend our approach to the case of multi-LUs with unknown Eve locations. Being different from the case of a single LU, the frequency offsets across array antennas are optimized to equally allocate transmitted power to each LU. The numerical results show that the proposed method can provide a higher secrecy performance than conventional DM methods. In the case of multi-LUs with unknown Eve locations, the proposed method can provide a high secrecy capacity while achieving almost equal achievable capacity to each LU.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper considers physical layer security enhancement mechanisms that utilize simultaneous beamforming and jamming in visible light communication systems with a randomly located eavesdropper under the assumption that there are multiple light-emitting diode (LED) transmitters and one intended user. When an eavesdropper with an augmented front-end receiver is present, the jamming is very useful for preventing the eavesdropper from wiretapping the information since it is not possible to extract only the information component from the received signal if the jamming signal is random. Thus, in this paper, an optimization problem is formulated with a focus on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio for the legitimate link, and it is solved by a heuristic method called the concave&#x2013;convex procedure. Then, a ternary scheme is proposed, which is less complicated than the full (joint) scheme, and it is optimized by adopting a formulation based on an assignment problem, the solution of which is effectively obtained by the so-called tabu search procedure. In addition, the problem of maximizing the average secrecy rate is investigated by utilizing a continuous LED model, which significantly relaxes the complication that rises from calculating the expectation with respect to the location of the eavesdropper. Our analysis and simulation results show that the proposed simultaneous beamforming and jamming strategies (both joint and ternary) are good proxies for maximizing the average secrecy rate by utilizing the statistical information on the eavesdropper&#x2019;s random location.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a new algorithm for automatic estimation of muscle fiber orientation (MFO) in musculoskeletal ultrasound images, which is commonly used for both diagnosis and rehabilitation assessment of patients. The algorithm is based on a novel adaptive fading Bayesian Kalman filter (AF-BKF) and an automatic region of interest (ROI) extraction method. The ROI is first enhanced by the Gabor filter (GF) and extracted automatically using the revoting constrained Radon transform (RCRT) approach. The dominant MFO in the ROI is then detected by the RT and tracked by the proposed AF-BKF, which employs simplified Gaussian mixtures to approximate the non-Gaussian state densities and a new adaptive fading method to update the mixture parameters. An AF-BK smoother (AF-BKS) is also proposed by extending the AF-BKF using the concept of Rauch&#x2013;Tung&#x2013;Striebel smoother for further smoothing the fascicle orientations. The experimental results and comparisons show that: 1) the maximum segmentation error of the proposed RCRT is below nine pixels, which is sufficiently small for MFO tracking; 2) the accuracy of MFO gauged by RT in the ROI enhanced by the GF is comparable to that of using multiscale vessel enhancement filter-based method and better than those of local RT and revoting Hough transform approaches; and 3) the proposed AF-BKS algorithm outperforms the other tested approaches and achieves a performance close to those obtained by experienced operators (the overall covariance obtained by the AF-BKS is 3.19, which is rather close to that of the operators, 2.86). It, thus, serves as a valuable tool for automatic estimation of fascicle orientations and possibly for other applications in musculoskeletal ultrasound images.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Automated production systems are critical enablers for Industry 4.0 because these design-to-order, custom-built mechatronic systems are not only capable of delivering automation capabilities to satisfy the stakeholder requirements in the manufacturing/production domain, but doing so for a long period of time (e.g., several decades) during which numerous changing needs shall also be accounted for. Although traceability has long been recognized as key to sustain changes, little is known about how the traceability information is managed in place, i.e., in the native environments where the engineering artifacts reside. We contribute in this paper a survey of traceability support within state-of-the-practice tools: seven for programming logic controllers and six for building models in systems modeling language. We draw the similarities and differences from our survey results, and further present a design by leveraging the in-place traceability to better support the development and evolution of automated production systems.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a variable structure speed controller (VSSC) that guarantees the robust transient performance against the external disturbances and parameter uncertainties of an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive. Unlike the conventional VSSC applied to the IPMSMs, the proposed nonlinear compensating control term not only assures the robustness against the system uncertainties, but also implements the maximum torque per ampere technique. Furthermore, the convergence and stability of the proposed VSSC are fully proven through the Lyapunov theory by introducing reasonable bounded uncertainties which determine a feasible range for the system dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is investigated through the simulation using MATLAB/Simulink and experiment using a prototype IPMSM drive system with a TI TMS320F28335 DSP. Finally, the proposed VSSC can ensure faster and more robust transient response than the conventional proportional-integral speed controller under the dynamic load conditions including the uncertainties.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Applying consortium blockchain as a trust layer for heterogeneous industrial Internet-of-Things devices is cost-effective. However, with an increase in computing power, some powerful attacks (e.g., the 51&#x0025; attack) are inevitable and will cause severe consequences. Recent studies also confirm that anonymity and immutability of blockchain have been abused to facilitate black market trades, etc. To operate controllable blockchain for IIoT devices, it is necessary to rewrite blockchain history back to a normal state once the chain is breached. Ateniese et al. proposed redactable blockchain by using chameleon hash (CH) to replace traditional hash function, it allows blockchain history to be written when needed (EuroS&amp;P 2017). However, we cannot apply this idea directly to IIoT without solving the following problems: (1) achieve a decentralized design of CH; (2) update the signatures accordingly to authenticate the redacted contents; (3) satisfy the low-computing need of the individual IIoT device. In this paper, we overcome the above issues by proposing the first threshold chameleon hash (TCH) and accountable-and-sanitizable chameleon signature (ASCS) schemes. Based on them, we build a redactable consortium blockchain which is efficient for IIoT devices to operate. It allows a group of authorized sensors to write and rewrite blockchain without causing any hard forks. Basically, TCH is the first TCH and ASCS is a public-key signature supporting file-level and block-level modifications of signatures without impairing authentications. Additionally, ASCS achieves accountability to avoid abuse of redaction. While security analysis validates our proposals, the simulation results show that redaction is acceptably efficient if it is executed at a small scale or if we adopt a coarse-grained redaction while sacrificing some securities.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In recent years, great success has been achieved in visual object detection, which is one of the fundamental tasks in the field of industrial intelligence. Most of existing methods have been proposed to deal with single well-captured still images, while in practical robotic applications, due to nuisances, such as tiny scale, partial view, or occlusion, one still image may not contain enough information for object detection. However, an intelligent robot has the capability to adjust its viewpoint to get better images for detection. Therefore, active object detection becomes a very important perception strategy for intelligent robots. In this paper, by formulating active object detection as a sequential action decision process, a deep reinforcement learning framework is established to resolve it. Furthermore, a novel deep Q-learning network (DQN) with a dueling architecture is proposed, the network has two separate output channels, one predicts action type and the other predicts action range. By combining the two output channels, the action space is explored more efficiently. Several methods are extensively validated and the results show that the proposed one obtains the best results and predicts action in real time.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The performance of model-based state-of-charge (SOC) estimation method relies on an accurate battery model. Nonlinear models are thus proposed to accurately describe the external characteristics of the lithium-ion battery. The nonlinear estimation algorithms and online parameter identification methods are needed to guarantee the accuracy of the model-based SOC estimation with nonlinear battery models. A new approach forming a dynamic linear battery model is proposed in this paper, which enables the application of the linear Kalman filter for SOC estimation and also avoids the usage of online parameter identification methods. With a moving window technology, partial least squares regression is able to establish a series of piecewise linear battery models automatically. One element state-space equation is then obtained to estimate the SOC from the linear Kalman filter. The experiments on a LiFePO<sub>4</sub> battery prove the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the extended Kalman filter with two resistance and capacitance equivalent circuit model and the adaptive unscented Kalman filter with least squares support vector machines.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fuzzy modeling has been widely used to model lumped parameter systems. However, it cannot be used to model complex distributed parameter systems (DPS) due to its inability to handle spatial dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel spatiotemporal fuzzy method for the modeling of complex nonlinear DPSs. A spatial fuzzy model is first constructed to represent the nonlinear spatial dynamics. This process ensures that the space information is inherently considered in the spatiotemporal fuzzy model. A fuzzy model is then used to represent the nonlinear temporal dynamics. These two fuzzy models are further integrated to construct a spatiotemporal fuzzy model, which allows for the reconstruction of the DPS. Additionally, it can improve the modeling robustness even in the presence of noise due to the robust ability of fuzzy modeling. Performance analyses and experimental validations further show that the proposed method can effectively model complex nonlinear DPSs and has the better modeling ability than several commonly used methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Converter-driven direct current (dc) motors exhibit various advantages in industry, but impose several challenges to higher precision speed regulation in the presence of parametric uncertainties and exogenous, time-varying load torque disturbances. In this paper, the robust predictive speed regulation problem of a generic dc&#x2013;dc buck converter-driven permanent magnet dc motors is addressed by using an output feedback discrete-time model predictive control algorithm. A new discrete-time reduced-order generalized proportional-integral observer (GPIO) is proposed to reconstruct the virtual system states as well as the lumped disturbances. The estimates of GPIO are then collected for output speed prediction. An optimized duty ratio law of the converter is obtained by solving a constrained receding horizon optimization problem, where the operational constraint on control input is explicitly taken into account. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed new algorithm is demonstrated by various experimental testing results.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the automated demand response (DR) problem in smart grids equipped with information and communication technology networks, where power generating and consuming units can exchange information as a multiagent system (MAS), and a real-time pricing (RTP) scheme is proposed. When the communication graph among agents is connected, a novel parallel and distributed consensus-based algorithm is proposed to derive an RTP scheme to facilitate DR, and when communication uncertainties exist, a robust consensus algorithm is proposed to cease the effect of uncertainties. Next, this paper proposes a novel control mechanism to tackle the problem of disconnected communication among agents, e.g., under cyber-attacks, by employing the so-called mixed communication-broadcast control architecture where the underlying ideas are twofold. First, each area in the grid associated with a connected subgraph is controlled by a MAS to guarantee the power balance and to reach consensus on the local electric price for that area. Second, a supervisory unit observes those local electric prices to calculate the global electric price for the whole grid and then broadcasts to all units so that they can properly adjust their output powers. Simulations are carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system to validate the proposed control mechanisms.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper describes an augmented reality (AR)-aided smart sensing technique for in-line condition monitoring of insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) wafers. A series of signal processing algorithms are applied for enabling sensor intelligence. Based on electromagnetic infrared&#x2013;visible fusion (IVF), a supplementary palpable three-dimensional thermography layer is integrated with an IGBT wafer in real world environment. Before the IVF, independent component analysis is implemented to identify defects in the wafer. The proposed AR-aided smart sensing technique enhances user&#x0027;s perception and interaction between the industrial systems and the surrounding world. In contrast to conventional sensor techniques, it provides nondestructive testing and evaluation based high-throughput in-line condition monitoring method. The advantages of noncontact and time efficient of this smart sensing technique potentially bring huge benefit to yield management and production efficiency. AR-aided smart sensing can improve the productivity, quality, and reliability of power electronic materials and devices, as well as in other industrial applications.
