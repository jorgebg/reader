<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Despite the popularity and practical applicability of blockchains, there is
very limited work on the theoretical foundation of blockchains: The lack of
rigorous theory and analysis behind the curtain of blockchains has severely
staggered its broader applications. This paper attempts to lay out a
theoretical foundation for a specific type of blockchains---the ones requiring
basic authenticity from the participants, also called \textit{permissioned
blockchain}. We formulate permissioned blockchain systems and operations into a
game-theoretical problem by incorporating constraints implied by the wisdom
from distributed computing and Byzantine systems. We show that in a
noncooperative blockchain game (NBG), a Nash equilibrium can be efficiently
found in a closed-form even though the game involves more than two players.
Somewhat surprisingly, the simulation results of the Nash equilibrium implies
that the game can reach a stable status regardless of the number of Byzantine
nodes and trustworthy players. We then study a harder problem where players are
allowed to form coalitions: the coalitional blockchain game (CBG). We show that
although the Shapley value for a CBG can be expressed in a more succinct form,
its core is empty.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Monero is a popular crypto-currency which focuses on privacy. The blockchain
uses cryptographic techniques to obscure transaction values as well as a `ring
confidential transaction' which seeks to hide a real transaction among a
variable number of spoofed transactions. We have developed training sets of
simulated blockchains of 10 and 50 agents, for which we have control over the
ground truth and keys, in order to test these claims. We featurize Monero
transactions by characterizing the local structure of the public-facing
blockchains and use labels obtained from the simulations to perform machine
learning. Machine Learning of our features on the simulated blockchain shows
that the technique can be used to aide in identifying individuals and groups,
although it did not successfully reveal the hidden transaction values. We apply
the technique on the real Monero blockchain to identify ShapeShift
transactions, a cryptocurrency exchange that has leaked information through
their API providing labels for themselves and their users.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Internet security and privacy stand on the trustworthiness of public
certificates signed by Certificate Authorities (CAs). However, software
products do not trust the same CAs and therefore maintain different root
stores, each typically containing hundreds of trusted roots capable of issuing
"trusted" certificates for any domain. Incidents with misissued certificates
motivated Google to implement and enforce Certificate Transparency (CT). CT
logs archive certificates in a public, auditable and append-only manner. The
adoption of CT changed the trust landscape, with logs too maintaining their own
root lists and only logging certificates that chain back to one of their roots.
In this paper, we present a first characterization of this emerging CT root
store landscape, as well as the tool that we developed for data collection,
visualization, and analysis of the root stores. As part of our
characterization, we compare the logs' root stores and quantify their changes
with respect to both each other and the root stores of major software vendors,
look at evolving vendor CT policies, and show that root store mismanagement may
be linked to log misbehavior. Finally, we present and discuss the results of a
survey that we have sent to the log operators participating in Apple's and
Google's CT log programs.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The evolution of the utilization of technologies in nearly all aspects of
life has produced an enormous amount of data essential in a smart city.
Therefore, maximizing the benefits of technologies such as cloud computing, fog
computing, and the Internet of things is important to manage and manipulate
data in smart cities. However, certain types of data are sensitive and risky
and may be infiltrated by malicious attacks. As a result, such data may be
corrupted, thereby causing concern. The damage inflicted by an attacker on a
set of data can spread through an entire database. Valid transactions that have
read corrupted data can update other data items based on the values read. In
this study, we introduce a unique model that uses fog computing in smart cities
to manage utility service companies and consumer data. We also propose a novel
technique to assess damage to data caused by an attack. Thus, original data can
be recovered, and a database can be returned to its consistent state as no
attacking has occurred.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We propose the scheme that mitigates the adversarial perturbation $\epsilon$
on the adversarial example $X_{adv}$ ($=$ $X$ $\pm$ $\epsilon$, $X$ is a benign
sample) by subtracting the estimated perturbation $\hat{\epsilon}$ from $X$ $+$
$\epsilon$ and adding $\hat{\epsilon}$ to $X$ $-$ $\epsilon$. The estimated
perturbation $\hat{\epsilon}$ comes from the difference between $X_{adv}$ and
its moving-averaged outcome $W_{avg}*X_{adv}$ where $W_{avg}$ is $N \times N$
moving average kernel that all the coefficients are one. Usually, the adjacent
samples of an image are close to each other such that we can let $X$ $\approx$
$W_{avg}*X$ (naming this relation after X-MAS[X minus Moving Averaged
Samples]). By doing that, we can make the estimated perturbation
$\hat{\epsilon}$ falls within the range of $\epsilon$. The scheme is also
extended to do the multi-level mitigation by configuring the mitigated
adversarial example $X_{adv}$ $\pm$ $\hat{\epsilon}$ as a new adversarial
example to be mitigated. The multi-level mitigation gets $X_{adv}$ closer to
$X$ with a smaller (i.e. mitigated) perturbation than original unmitigated
perturbation by setting the moving averaged adversarial sample $W_{avg} *
X_{adv}$ (which has the smaller perturbation than $X_{adv}$ if $X$ $\approx$
$W_{avg}*X$) as the boundary condition that the multi-level mitigation cannot
cross over (i.e. decreasing $\epsilon$ cannot go below and increasing
$\epsilon$ cannot go beyond). With the multi-level mitigation, we can get high
prediction accuracies even in the adversarial example having a large
perturbation (i.e. $\epsilon$ $&gt;$ $16$). The proposed scheme is evaluated with
adversarial examples crafted by the FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method) based
attacks on ResNet-50 trained with ImageNet dataset.

<p>Observational studies have suggested that the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients has decreased over time.1,2 Decreasing temporal incidence of CRC is attributed to increased surveillance and improved surveillance techniques.1 Additionally, new, more effective drugs have raised the bar with expectations of endoscopic and histological healing as a target for treatment, which might also lower the risk of CRC. Further support for decreasing CRC in patients with UC comes from studies showing that all-cause colectomy incidence in UC is decreasing.

An inner bound on the semantic-security (SS) SM-SK capacity region is derived based on a superposition coding scheme inspired by a past work of the authors. The region is shown to attain capacity for a certain class of SD-WTCs. SS is established by virtue of two versions of the strong soft-covering lemma. The derived region yields an improvement upon the previously best known SM-SK trade-off result reported by Prabhakaran et al., and, to the best of our knowledge, upon all other existing lower bounds for either SM or SK for this setup, even if the semantic security requirement is relaxed to weak secrecy. It is demonstrated that our region can be strictly larger than those reported in the preceding works.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recently, axial displacement detection of transformer winding has been performed using synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) imaging, as an online method, in ultra-wideband frequency band. Another important problem in power transformers is partial discharge (PD), which emits signal in the ultra-high-frequency (UHF) frequency band. If detection of axial displacement using SAR imaging can be applied to the UHF band, both defects can be detected using only one set of antennas and application of these methods can be more economic. However, as shown in this paper, using the same frequency band for detection of both defects leads to wrong conclusions about winding conditions, if PD is occurred during the application of SAR imaging. As a solution, UHF stepped-frequency imaging method and generalized likelihood ratio test method are proposed for detection of axial displacement. Finally, on a three-phase real transformer both defects are simultaneously detected using designed monitoring system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper addresses the problem of sensor selection in a sensor network for tracking a moving target. By considering network uncertainties and unpredictable movements of the target, reliable sensor selection approaches such as sigma points probability and target trajectory are proposed. An updated unscented Kalman filter is proposed to achieve effective tracking of the target through the sensor selection. A multialgorithm genetically adaptive multiobjective is utilized to have a selection strategy without knowing the number of sensors to be selected. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach both in simulation and practical experimentation. The proposed algorithm is also tested in the industrial setting where providing safety is of great importance for a human worker who walks in a potentially dangerous workplace. The results confirm the effectiveness and utility of the proposed scheme.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The mission abort is an effective action to reduce the risk of casualties and enhance the survivability of mission-based systems such as aircrafts, submarines, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A main task in real operations is to strive for balance between the mission reliability and the system survivability via elaborate mission abort plans. In this paper, we design the optimal mission abort policies based on the information of early-warning signals, which indicates the possible forthcoming fatal malfunction. Depending on the acquisition time of such information, the operator may immediately abort the mission, or ignore the information and continue the task. Within the framework of a constant mission duration, we carry out an economic analysis for the above problem. The optimal abort decision that minimizes the expected total economic loss is investigated. We further extend the proposed model to the scenario of a random mission duration and derive the corresponding optimal abort decisions. A case study on a UAV executing power-grid inspection missions is used to illustrate the applicability of the abort policies.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In past research, in-hand object manipulation for various sized and shaped objects has been achieved. However, the network had to be trained for each different motion. Training data takes time to acquire and increases the hardware load, thereby increasing the cost for training data. Four-fingered in-hand manipulation is especially difficult as a high number of joints need to be controlled in synchrony. This paper presents a method that reduces the required training data for in-hand manipulation with the idea of pretraining and mutual finger motions. The Allegro Hand is used with soft fingertips and integrated 6-axis F/T sensors to evaluate the proposed method. To make the network more versatile, the training data included objects of various sizes and shapes. When pretraining the network, one shot learning suffices to learn a new task; mutual finger motions can be exploited to use three-fingered pretraining data for four-fingered manipulation. Both data-sharing and weight-sharing were used and show similar results. Crucially, pretraining data from fingers with the same kinematic chain has to be used, showing the importance of morphology specific learning. Moreover, objects with untrained sizes and shapes could be manipulated.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In order to solve the problem of low detection accuracy of small targets in the SSD detection algorithm, a pipeline magnetic flux leakage image detection algorithm based on multiscale SSD network is proposed in this paper. The dilated convolution and attention residual module are introduced into the SSD algorithm to fuse the low-resolution high-semantic information feature map with the high-resolution low-semantic information feature map so as to improve the resolution of the low-resolution feature map and provide detailed features for small targets. Finally, the target location and category are obtained by regression algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can automatically identify the location of circumferential weld, spiral weld, and defect of magnetic flux leakage data. Compared with the original SSD algorithm framework, the improved algorithm has higher detection accuracy, 97.62&#x0025;, 18.01&#x0025; lower false detection rate, 18.36&#x0025; lower false detection rate, better robustness, and obvious effect on small target detection.

<p>In Reply Drs Lippi and Targher, as well as Dr Li and colleagues, comment that the findings of our trial are applicable to a specific study population. Although Lippi and Targher&#8217;s thresholds for 25(OH)D deficiency and insufficiency are above those of Health Canada and the Institute of Medicine (IOM), we share their concern that our results might be inappropriately interpreted as applicable to a population that is vitamin D&#8211;deficient. By most standards, the participants in our study were vitamin D&#8211;sufficient on study entry. Recent evidence suggests that 30 nmol/L is a useful threshold for vitamin D deficiency in bone (ie, osteomalacia or vitamin D&#8211;responsive low bone density). Although mild mineralization defects may be seen at levels greater than 30 nmol/L, the IOM report determined that a level of 50 nmol/L reflects adequate vitamin D exposure for 97.5% of the population. In our study, the mean baseline 25(OH)D level was 78.7 nmol/L. There were not enough participants with levels below 50 nmol/L (n&#8201;=&#8201;24) for meaningful subgroup analysis. However, examining total volumetric BMD at the radius for the 138 participants with 25(OH)D levels of 75 nmol/L or less, a dose-dependent pattern of bone loss was seen similar to what was seen in the full cohort: greatest loss in the 10&#8239;000-IU group (Figure).

<p>In Reply Dr Scott raises an interesting and valid objection to my essay. Why not appreciate the aspects of science that elucidate beauty and truth, ie, their humanistic aspects? I agree with that assertion but disagree with his thesis that implies that such wonder in science can equal or replace the humanistic benefits of a humanities education. The notion that an education in science and math will endow students with an appreciation of the beauty of science, math, physics, and chemistry that will ever equal or replace the inestimable, and crucially quite different, worth of a humanities education is unconvincing. The day in, day out exposure to the more accessible joys of the humanities, as in Tolstoy&#8217;s Anna Karenina, Michelangelo&#8217;s Piet&#224;, or Bruch&#8217;s Violin Concerto No. 1 in G Minor, are simply not present in a premed background. I had 3 years of chemistry, physics, calculus, and biology and was all but a premed major save for 2 courses, all the while fulfilling requirements for a classics major. Not once during all those premed classes did I experience the drama and resolve and redemption I do every time I listen to Dvo&#345;&#225;k&#8217;s Symphony No. 7 in D Minor. Nowhere in physics will one plumb the intricate psychological depths of the human condition one encounters in G&#233;ricault&#8217;s The Raft of the Medusa. The math student who can marvel at the elegance of Euler&#8217;s identity (ei&#960; + 1&#8201;=&#8201;0) is privileged to be able to do so. But such appreciation is not a replacement for having read, understood, and welcomed the simple yet profound truths of humanity in Cervantes&#8217; Don Quijote. The beauties and wonders of science and the beauties and enduring truths of the humanities may both contribute to the education of a compassionate graduate.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To the Editor Dr Burt and colleagues concluded that treatment of healthy adults with high-dose vitamin D supplementation for 3 years did not have any beneficial effects on volumetric bone mineral density (BMD) and bone strength. Although these results appear similar to findings that disputed the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation in the general population, we emphasize that these results should not be generalized. The baseline mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations in the 3 groups randomized to different doses of supplementation ranged from 76.7 to 81.3 nmol/L, considerably higher than currently accepted thresholds for diagnosing vitamin D deficiency (&#8804;50 nmol/L) and insufficiency (&#8804;75 nmol/L). Although participants with serum 25(OH)D concentrations less than 30 nmol/L were excluded from the study, it cannot be concluded that those with serum 25(OH)D values between 30 and 75 nmol/L would have responded more favorably to high-dose vitamin D supplementation in terms of volumetric BMD and bone strength. We believe that a further subanalysis of these patients might be advisable.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Women have used powders for genital hygiene for decades to absorb odor and moisture. While rates of powder use in the genital area have declined over the last 50 years, it remains a routine practice for some women. Commonly used products typically include talc, cornstarch, or some combination of both. Women may apply powders directly to the perineum or onto sanitary napkins, tampons, diaphragms, or underwear. Investigations of an association between the use of talc-containing powders for genital hygiene and epithelial ovarian cancer risks have provided inconsistent results to date and resulted in ongoing controversy. Since 1971, peer-reviewed articles have documented the possible association between talc use and the development of ovarian cancer. However, a PubMed search covering the last 5 decades identified only 17 primary or secondary studies and 36 other articles that were reviews, commentaries, meta-analyses, or letters to the editor. In short, while some investigations have been reported, the majority of publications were opinion and discussion articles.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims at matching person images captured in non-overlapping camera views. To represent person appearance, low-level visual features are sensitive to environmental changes, while high-level semantic attributes, such as &#x201c;short-hair&#x201d; or &#x201c;long-hair&#x201d;, are relatively stable. Hence, researches have started to design semantic attributes to reduce the visual ambiguity. However, to train a prediction model for semantic attributes, it requires plenty of annotations, which are hard to obtain in practical large-scale applications. To alleviate the reliance on annotation efforts, we propose to incrementally generate Deep Hidden Attribute (DHA) based on baseline deep network for newly uncovered annotations. In particular, we propose an auto-encoder model that can be plugged into any deep network to mine latent information in an unsupervised manner. To optimize the effectiveness of DHA, we reform the auto-encoder model with additional orthogonal generation module, along with identity-preserving and sparsity constraints. 1) Orthogonally generating: In order to make DHAs different from each other, Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD) is introduced to generate DHAs orthogonally. 2) Identity-preserving constraint: The generated DHAs should be distinct for telling different persons, so we associate DHAs with person identities. 3) Sparsity constraint: To enhance the discriminability of DHAs, we also introduce the sparsity constraint to restrict the number of effective DHAs for each person. Experiments conducted on public datasets have validated the effectiveness of the proposed network. On two large-scale datasets, i.e., Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Learning an effective distance measurement between sample pairs plays an important role in visual analysis, where the training procedure largely relies on hard negative samples. However, hard negative samples usually account for the tiny minority in the training set, which may fail to fully describe the data distribution close to the decision boundary. In this paper, we present a deep adversarial metric learning (DAML) framework to generate synthetic hard negatives from the original negative samples, which is widely applicable to existing supervised deep metric learning algorithms. Different from existing sampling strategies which simply ignore numerous easy negatives, our DAML aim to exploit them by generating synthetic hard negatives adversarial to the learned metric as complements. We simultaneously train the feature embedding and hard negative generator in an adversarial manner, so that adequate and targeted synthetic hard negatives are created to learn more precise distance metrics. As a single transformation may not be powerful enough to describe the global input space under the attack of the hard negative generator, we further propose a deep adversarial multi-metric learning (DAMML) method by learning multiple local transformations for more complete description. We simultaneously exploit the collaborative and competitive relationships among multiple metrics, where the metrics display unity against the generator for effective distance measurement as well as compete for more training data through a metric discriminator to avoid overlapping. Extensive experimental results on five benchmark datasets show that our DAML and DAMML effectively boost the performance of existing deep metric learning approaches through adversarial learning.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We propose Mask SSD, an efficient and effective approach to address the challenging instance segmentation task. Based on a single-shot detector, Mask SSD detects all instances in an image and marks the pixels that belong to each instance. It consists of a detection subnetwork that predicts object categories and bounding box locations, and an instance-level segmentation subnetwork that generates the foreground mask for each instance. In the detection subnetwork, multi-scale and feedback features from different layers are used to better represent objects of various sizes and provide high-level semantic information. Then, we adopt an assistant classification network to guide per-class score prediction, which consists of objectness prior and category likelihood. The instance-level segmentation subnetwork outputs pixel-wise segmentation for each detection while providing the multi-scale and feedback features from different layers as input. These two subnetworks are jointly optimized by a multi-task loss function, which renders Mask SSD direct prediction on detection and segmentation results. We conduct extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC, SBD, and MS COCO datasets to evaluate the performance of Mask SSD. Experimental results verify that as compared with state-of-the-art approaches, our proposed method has a comparable precision with less speed overhead.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Tone Mapping Operators (TMO) designed for videos can be classified into two categories. In a first approach, TMOs are temporal filtered to reduce temporal artifacts and provide a Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) content with improved temporal consistency. This however does not improve the SDR coding Rate Distortion (RD) performances. A second approach is to design the TMO with the goal of optimizing the SDR coding rate-distortion performances. This second category of methods may lead to SDR videos altering the artistic intent compared with the produced HDR content. In this paper, we combine the benefits of the two approaches by introducing new Weighted Prediction (WP) methods inside the HEVC SDR codec. As a first step, we demonstrate the interest of the WP methods compared to TMO optimized for RD performances. Then we present the newly introduced WP algorithm and WP modes. The WP algorithm consists in performing a global motion compensation between frames using an optical flow, and the new modes are based on non linear functions in contrast with the literature using only linear functions. The contribution of each novelty is studied independently and in a second time they are all put in competition to maximize the RD performances. Tests were made for HDR backward compatible compression but also for SDR compression only. In both cases, the proposed WP methods improve the RD performances while maintaining the SDR temporal coherency.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Finding suitable image representations for the task at hand is critical in computer vision. Different approaches extending the original Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) model have recently been proposed to offer rotation-invariant feature learning. In this paper, we present an extended novel RBM that learns rotation invariant features by explicitly factorizing for rotation nuisance in 2D image inputs within an unsupervised framework. While the goal is to learn invariant features, our model infers an orientation per input image during training, using information related to the reconstruction error. The training process is regularised by a Kullback-Leibler divergence, offering stability and consistency. We used the  $gamma $ -score, a measure that calculates the amount of invariance, to mathematically and experimentally demonstrate that our approach indeed learns rotation invariant features. We show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art RBM approaches for rotation invariant feature learning on three different benchmark datasets, by measuring the performance with the test accuracy of an SVM classifier. Our implementation is available at https://bitbucket.org/tuttoweb/rotinvrbm.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Squirrel-cage induction motor (SQIM) fed by a pulsewidth modulated voltage source inverter (VSI) is subjected to voltage and current surges. It may cause additional losses in the motor, insulation failure, high bearing current, and electromagnetic interference. To mitigate these problems, sinusoidal LC filter is placed at the ac-side of the VSI. This paper proposes a new methodology to design the filter. In this method, the filter inductance is chosen based on the maximum ripple in the inverter ac-side current and the voltage drop across the filter inductor, and the filter capacitor is chosen based on the steady-state reactive power demand of the SQIM. The effects of the designed filter on the switch current, losses in the drive, temperature of the dc-link capacitor, dv&#x002f;dt at the motor terminal, stator flux, and air-gap torque of the SQIM are discussed. The performance of the drive with the filters, designed by the proposed method and the standard method, are experimentally tested on a two-level silicon carbide VSI-fed SQIM and comparative analysis is carried out. The impact of the designed filter on the drive is also shown when the neutral point of the filter capacitors is connected with the mid-point of the dc link. The stability of the closed-loop controlled SQIM drive with the proposed filter, and simulation results are presented to verify its performance.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>For high-speed permanent magnet machines (HSPMMs), the permanent magnet (PM) is more likely to suffer irreversible demagnetization because the heat dissipation is serious in the HSPMMs, especially for the high-power machines. This paper focuses on the comprehensive research results on the power loss and thermal characteristic for a high-power HSPMM. First, the power loss at the rated load is investigated by finite-element analysis. Then, the temperature distribution of four cooling schemes is compared by the electromagnetic-thermal iteration calculation. The effect of different parameters on thermal behavior is obtained to reduce rotor temperature, which includes an examination of the axial flow duct, cooling medium, sleeve thickness, and sleeve thermal conductivity. Finally, an improved loss separation method is employed to obtain the loss distribution from the measured total loss, and the comprehensive experiments are implemented based on one HSPMM prototype (800 kW, 15 000 rpm) to verify the related theoretical analysis.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Differential power processing (DPP) is a promising architecture to solve the issue caused by mismatches among photovoltaic (PV) submodules. To eliminate the mismatch power losses, this paper presents an optimized PV-to-bus DPP system with submodule-level individual maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and module-level minimum-power tracking (MPT) simultaneous implementation according to the built mathematical model of the power processed by DPP converters with respect to the string current. Furthermore, a flexible time-sharing algorithm is adopted to reduce the number of MPPT units. Compared with other solutions, such as PV optimizer, the proposed scheme can reduce the effects of mismatches to the minimum regardless of mismatch conditions. The system cost is reduced since only one adaptive MPPT controller is required. Besides, the system efficiency is improved due to the true MPPT implementation and MPT control. Both simulation and experimental tests are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The fast detection of magnitude, frequency, and phase angle of the fundamental-frequency component is very useful in many three-phase power system applications. Most techniques to accomplish this task are based on different versions of three-phase phase-locked loop (PLL) schemes. Some variables of three-phase systems may experience phase angle jumps after some disturbances. In this paper, a method for the fast detection of phase angle jump occurrence, estimation of the phase angle jump, and its use for improving the performance of the generalized delayed signal cancelation (GDSC) PLL is proposed. The proposed method is based on the detailed evaluation of the GDSC filter transient behavior after a phase jump. Results considering typical three-phase grid disturbances are used to evaluate the proposed scheme, in comparison with other usual PLL techniques. The use of the proposed phase jump angle estimator allowed a reduction in the GDSC-PLL convergence time of about 50&#x0025;.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Time delay control (TDC) is a promising technique for robot manipulators because it is model-free, efficient, and yet, robust. Nevertheless, when a robot operates under significant payload changes, it is difficult to achieve satisfactory performance with a constant gain. To cope with this problem, several adaptive rules have already been proposed thus far, but they are less effective to significant payload changes, and parameter tuning procedures are too complicated. In this paper, we propose an adaptive gain dynamics that is more effective in payload changes and yet simpler to implement. Through simulations using a one-link arm and experiments using a whole arm manipulator with payload changes, the proposed dynamics was compared with the conventional TDC and two other existing methods. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can adapt to significant payload changes, achieving better accuracy than the conventional TDC. Experimental results show that the proposed method has consistently better adaptation capability than other methods, achieving significantly better accuracy. In addition, the proposed method is simpler to implement, having only one tuning parameter, whereas the existing methods require four or five such tuning parameters.
