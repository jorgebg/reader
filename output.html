</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to the global environmental issues and energy crisis, the injection of renewable energy sources (RESs) into the power system is continuously increasing. As the interface between RESs and power grid, grid-tied inverters using MOSFET switches, without traditional line frequency transformers, show some potential advantages, in terms of low cost, high efficiency, and lightweight and small size. Among several proposed configurations, the Aalborg inverter was proposed as a new family of high efficiency MOSFET-switch-based hybrid source inverters. For a conventional &#x201c;half bridge&#x201d; type Aalborg inverter, due to the imbalance of two independent dc sources, the input dc energies may not be fully utilized, which may reduce the efficiency of whole system. In order to extract the maximum energy from two independent dc sources, a coupled-inductor-based &#x201c;half bridge&#x201d; type Aalborg inverter is proposed in this paper. The principle of operation is presented and demonstrated through equivalent circuits. The effectiveness of a new energy balancing technique has been validated through simulations and experiments on a 110 V/ 500 W prototype.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A nonisolated single-stage electronic lighting system with a high power factor for driving power light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is proposed in this paper. The presented topology is based on the integration of a bridgeless boost rectifier with a nonresonant half-bridge converter. Accurate steady-state analyses of the nonresonant- and resonant-based circuits are reported, serving as the basis for designing the lighting systems. The LEDs current is adjusted by means of frequency modulation, being the converter switches driven by complementary symmetrical signals. A small-signal analysis is detailed for the proposed nonresonant scheme, providing fundamental information regarding its dynamic behavior. Also, a step-by-step design procedure based on the performed mathematical analysis is elaborated, allowing the adequate design of the proposed lighting system. In order to confirm the validity and the feasibility of the proposed converter, experimental results for a 42-W, 127- ${rm{V}}_{{rm{rms}}}$, 50-kHz, 94.2&#x0025; peak efficiency prototype are presented.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a novel design for the axial flow blood pump is proposed, based on the bearingless permanent magnet (PM) motor concept. The design of the impeller, the rotor, and the stator is explained. The axial length of the impeller is optimized based on the finite-element analysis (FEA), and because of reduced axial length of the rotor, only one radial active magnetic bearing is used, whose functionality is embedded in the same stator, which is used for generating motor torque. A novel design of the rotor and the stator is proposed for measuring the radial position of the rotor using four linear Hall effect sensors. This sensor assembly can measure the radial position of the rotor with good accuracy. The angular position of the rotor is measured with two Hall effect sensors. The 3-D FEA of the complete system is performed, and suspension forces, stiffness, and torques are evaluated under various control conditions. The control strategy for the bearingless PM motor based on the Hall effect position sensors is explained. The experimental setup is built in order to guide the process of design. The experimental results of the system are evaluated under different operating conditions and compared with FEA results.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a robust coupled multiple sliding-mode control (CMSMC) method for tracking control of underactuated hovercraft systems with nonholonomic constraints and external disturbances. First, a friction model for the hovercraft, one of the main disturbance factors, is proposed by considering viscosity, and its validity is demonstrated through experiments. Second, a disturbance model in the actual hovercraft system is estimated using a least-square-estimation-based disturbance observer. Third, pseudo forces and pseudo heading direction angle for tracking control and disturbance compensation are proposed considering the characteristics of underactuated hovercraft systems. Fourth, coupled multiple sliding surfaces (CMSSs) are newly introduced in terms of the tracking errors between the pseudo control variables and actual ones, and then, a CMSMC-based controller is proposed so that the CMSSs converge to zero within finite time in the case of zero disturbance estimation errors. In this way, three posture variables of the hovercraft converge to reference ones using only two control inputs. Finally, stability analysis and verification by simulations and experiments show that both the pseudo control tracking errors and posture tracking errors are ultimately bounded and asymptotically converge to zero when disturbance estimation errors become zero.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>As for ripple-current mode control, it cannot achieve average current tracking, resulting in poor current accuracy and even current waveform distortion. Meanwhile, fast-scale instability may occur in some operating conditions. To solve these problems effectively, a current-ripple compensation (CRC) control technique is proposed in this paper. The error between the average of the controlled current and the reference current is compensated by certain compensation signal, achieving average current tracking while suppressing fast-scale instability. On this basis, the compensator in the outer-voltage loop is further simplified to a proportional part by introducing a rebuilt average reference current. The idea and design procedure of the proposed CRC control technique are discussed in detail. Accordingly, two available implementation schemes for the proposed CRC are presented, including slope compensated and parabolic compensated schemes. Finally, two application cases, respectively, to dc&#x2013;dc Buck converter and Boost PFC converter, are presented to verify the proposed CRC control technique.

<p>Energy management in electric grids with multiple energy sources, generators, storage devices, and interacting loads along with their complex behaviors requires grid wide control. Communication infrastructure that aggregates information from heterogeneous devices in the electric grid making the applications completely independent of physical connectivity is essential for building in the context of control applications. This investigation presents a semantic middleware that is used to implement a receding-horizon-based optimal power flow (OPF) in smart grids. The presence of renewable energy sources, storage systems, and loads dispersed all along the grid necessitates the use of grid wide control and a communication infrastructure to support it. To this extent, the proposed middleware will serve as the basis for representing various components of the power grid. It is enriched with intelligence by semantic annotation and ontologies that provide situation awareness and context discovery. The middleware deployment is demonstrated by implementing the receding horizon OPF in a network in Steinkjer, Norway. Our results demonstrate the advantages of both the middleware and the algorithm. Furthermore, the results prove the added flexibility obtained in the grid due to the addition of renewable energy and storage systems. The significant advantage of the proposed approach is that the real-time monitoring infrastructure is used for improving the flexibility, reliability, and efficiency of the grid.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a new sensorless deadbeat control method is proposed. In the deadbeat method, the desired voltage is calculated via the model of the induction motor and inverter (prediction model). This voltage impels the motor to track the references of the torque and flux in the next control interval. Robustness is an important issue about the deadbeat method. Two new techniques are used to reach a robust speed-independent sensorless deadbeat method. A speed-independent model is sued for prediction. Therefore, the estimated speed will not be used in the prediction model. It will reduce the drift error problem. Also, a new adaptive predictive method is proposed for simultaneous estimation of the stator resistance and speed. Only direct-axis equation is used in the adaptive method. This will reduce the calculation burden. The new adaptive function is achieved via the Lyapunov technique. The stability of the multiple-input multiple-output system for simultaneous adaptation is analyzed for the gain design problem. Simulation and experimental results in wide range of speed are depicted in order to verify the proposed method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The objective of visual servoing aims to control an object&#x0027;s motion with visual feedbacks and becomes popular recently. Problems of complex modeling and instability always exist in visual servoing methods. Moreover, there are few research works on selection of the servoing gain in image-based visual servoing (IBVS) methods. This paper proposes an IBVS method with Q-Learning, where the learning rate is adjusted by a fuzzy system. Meanwhile, a synthetic preprocess is introduced to perform feature extraction. The extraction method is actually a combination of a color-based recognition algorithm and an improved contour-based recognition algorithm. For dealing with underactuated dynamics of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a decoupled controller is designed, where the velocity and attitude are decoupled through attenuating the effects of underactuation in roll and pitch and two independent servoing gains, for linear and angular motion servoing, respectively, are designed in place of single servoing gain in traditional methods. For further improvement in convergence and stability, a reinforcement learning method, Q-Learning, is taken for adaptive servoing gain adjustment. The Q-Learning is composed of two independent learning agents for adjusting two serving gains, respectively. In order to improve the performance of the Q-Learning, a fuzzy-based method is proposed for tuning the learning rate. The results of simulations and experiments on control of UAVs demonstrate that the proposed method has better properties in stability and convergence than the competing methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The main feature of cyber-physical production systems is its adaptability. They adapt quickly to new requirements such as new products or product variants. Nowadays, a bottleneck is the automation system, for which high manual engineering efforts are needed: Today, on-site technicians write and rewrite automation software, configure real-time communication protocols and create system configurations consisting of machine timing, physical dimensions of products, sensitivity, and motor control accelerations and velocities. Cyber-physical production systems often solve this dilemma by relying on reusable software components, which are composed in the overall automation software. However, this solution comes with a price, reusable software components need free parameters to adjust to the individual production configurations. This paper addresses this central research question and presents a novel parameter estimation approach to choose automatically optimal system configurations for cyber-physical production systems. Different scenarios from discrete manufacturing plants are used to evaluate the solution approach.

<p><span class="paragraphSection">Journal peer review is often time-consuming, arduous, and fraught with suspicion, not least because the identities of reviewers usually remain hidden from the authors. Despite these flaws, and the fundamental problem that the efficiency and effectiveness of peer review have yet to be measured satisfactorily, authors, editors, reviewers, and readers have become comfortable with it. Editors like anointing colleagues as experts, reviewers appreciate peer review because it tends to confirm their own impressions of themselves as experts, and no one has created a better system to vet the validity of scientific reports. Authors may complain but also may be grateful for expert appraisal and criticism and subsequent improvement in their manuscripts. They realize that their work has been taken seriously and recognize that the incorporation of reviewers democratizes beyond the editor this part of the scientific enterprise. Readers feel assured that articles have been evaluated by experts, and the public at large, imagining a much deeper degree of scrutiny than is customary or possible, assumes that articles that are published in most peer-reviewed journals have passed some universal standard of quality.</span>

<p>Asthma remains a frightening diagnosis with an unclear prognosis and outcome. The estimated global burden of asthma is substantial1 and reductions in mortality from asthma have stalled since 2006, with wide variations between countries.2 Causes are multifactorial, triggers and symptoms are varied, and the disease course over a lifetime is unpredictable. Severity can fluctuate with sudden asthma attacks leading to death in previously well controlled patients or those with very few symptoms on no medication.

Substantial progress was made against key outcomes such as hospital admissions with asthma and mortality in the 1990s and early 2000s, but little improvement has been observed in the past 10 years, despite escalating treatment costs.
