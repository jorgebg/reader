<p>Minute pixel changes in an image drastically change the prediction that the
deep learning model makes. One of the most significant problems that could
arise due to this, for instance, is autonomous driving. Many methods have been
proposed to combat this with varying amounts of success. We propose a 3 step
method for defending such attacks. First, we denoise the image using
statistical methods. Second, we show that adopting multiple color spaces in the
same model can help us to fight these adversarial attacks further as each color
space detects certain features explicit to itself. Finally, the feature maps
generated are enlarged and sent back as an input to obtain even smaller
features. We show that the proposed model does not need to be trained to defend
an particular type of attack and is inherently more robust to black-box,
white-box, and grey-box adversarial attack techniques. In particular, the model
is 56.12 percent more robust than compared models in case of white box attacks
when the models are not subject to adversarial example training.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this work, we propose ENSEI, a secure inference (SI) framework based on
the frequency-domain secure convolution (FDSC) protocol for the efficient
execution of privacy-preserving visual recognition. Our observation is that,
under the combination of homomorphic encryption and secret sharing, homomorphic
convolution can be obliviously carried out in the frequency domain,
significantly simplifying the related computations. We provide protocol designs
and parameter derivations for number-theoretic transform (NTT) based FDSC. In
the experiment, we thoroughly study the accuracy-efficiency trade-offs between
time- and frequency-domain homomorphic convolution. With ENSEI, compared to the
best known works, we achieve 5--11x online time reduction, up to 33x setup time
reduction, and up to 10x reduction in the overall inference time. A further 33%
of bandwidth reductions can be obtained on binary neural networks with only 1%
of accuracy degradation on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

<p>Deep Learning has been shown to be particularly vulnerable to adversarial
samples. To combat adversarial strategies, numerous defensive techniques have
been proposed. Among these, a promising approach is to use randomness in order
to make the classification process unpredictable and presumably harder for the
adversary to control. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of randomized
defenses against adversarial samples. To this end, we categorize existing
state-of-the-art adversarial strategies into three attacker models of
increasing strength, namely blackbox, graybox, and whitebox (a.k.a.~adaptive)
attackers. We also devise a lightweight randomization strategy for image
classification based on feature squeezing, that consists of pre-processing the
classifier input by embedding randomness within each feature, before applying
feature squeezing. We evaluate the proposed defense and compare it to other
randomized techniques in the literature via thorough experiments. Our results
indeed show that careful integration of randomness can be effective against
both graybox and blackbox attacks without significantly degrading the accuracy
of the underlying classifier. However, our experimental results offer strong
evidence that in the present form such randomization techniques cannot deter a
whitebox adversary that has access to all classifier parameters and has full
knowledge of the defense. Our work thoroughly and empirically analyzes the
impact of randomization techniques against all classes of adversarial
strategies.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Smart Meters (SMs) are a fundamental component of smart grids, but they carry
sensitive information about users such as occupancy status of houses and
therefore, they have raised serious concerns about leakage of consumers'
private information. In particular, we focus on real-time privacy threats,
i.e., potential attackers that try to infer sensitive data from SMs reported
data in an online fashion. We adopt an information-theoretic privacy measure
and show that it effectively limits the performance of any real-time attacker.
Using this privacy measure, we propose a general formulation to design a
privatization mechanism that can provide a target level of privacy by adding a
minimal amount of distortion to the SMs measurements. On the other hand, to
cope with different applications, a flexible distortion measure is considered.
This formulation leads to a general loss function, which is optimized using a
deep learning adversarial framework, where two neural networks $-$ referred to
as the releaser and the adversary $-$ are trained with opposite goals. An
exhaustive empirical study is then performed to validate the performances of
the proposed approach for the occupancy detection privacy problem, assuming the
attacker disposes of either limited or full access to the training dataset.

<p>Security and privacy concerns in computer systems have grown in importance
with the ubiquity of connected devices. TEEs provide security guarantees based
on cryptographic constructs built in hardware. Intel software guard extensions
(SGX), in particular, implements powerful mechanisms that can shield sensitive
data even from privileged users with full control of system software. In this
work, we essentially explore some of the challenges of designing secure
distributed systems by using Intel SGX as cornerstone. We do so by designing
and experimentally evaluating several elementary systems ranging from
communication and processing middleware to a peer-to-peer privacy-preserving
solution. We start with support systems that naturally fit cloud deployment
scenarios, namely content-based routing, batching and stream processing
frameworks. We implement prototypes and use them to analyse the manifested
memory usage issues intrinsic to SGX. Next, we aim at protecting very sensitive
data: cryptographic keys. By leveraging TEEs, we design protocols for group
data sharing that have lower computational complexity than legacy methods. As a
bonus, our proposals allow large savings on metadata volume and processing time
of cryptographic operations, all with equivalent security guarantees. Finally,
we propose privacy-preserving systems against established services like
web-search engines. Our evaluation shows that we propose the most robust system
in comparison to existing solutions with regard to user re-identification rates
and results accuracy in a scalable way. Overall, this thesis proposes new
mechanisms that take advantage of TEEs for distributed system architectures. We
show through an empirical approach on top of Intel SGX what are the trade-offs
of distinct designs applied to distributed communication and processing,
cryptographic protocols and private web search.

<p>In the MOBILE trial,1 Laura Koskenvuo and colleagues confirmed the futility of mechanical bowel preparation even when combined with preoperative oral antibiotics. 20 years after the first randomised controlled trial2 on the topic, most surgeons in high-income countries remain reluctant to stop using mechanical bowel preparation, despite robust evidence of its ineffectiveness. Nonetheless, there are conflicting results from large prospective audit data, with mechanical bowel preparation showing some positive effects for high-risk, left-sided colorectal resections (American College National Surgical Quality Improvement Program; European Society of Coloproctology).

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In modern plants, industrial processes typically operate under different states to meet the different requirements of high-quality products. Many monitoring models for industrial processes were constructed based on the prior knowledge (the mechanism&#x0027;s model or the process data characteristics) to monitor such processes (called multimode processes). However, obtaining this prior knowledge is difficult in practice. Efficiently monitoring nonlinear multimode processes without any prior knowledge is an open problem that demands further exploration. Since data from different modes follow different distributions while data from the same mode are considered to be sampled from the same distribution, the modes of multimode processes can be uncovered based on the characteristics of the process data. This article proposes using a Dirichlet process Gaussian mixed model to classify the modes of multimode processes based on historical data, and then, determine the mode types of the monitored data. A nonlinear monitoring strategy based on the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding is then proposed to achieve nonlinear dimensionality reduction and visualize the data. Finally, a monitoring index that is integrated with support vector data description is constructed for comprehensive monitoring. The proposed nonlinear multimode framework completely realizes data-driven mode identification and unsupervised fault detection without knowing any prior knowledge. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model are demonstrated using data from a simulated wastewater treatment plant.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs), machine learning based data-driven methods have been applied to online power system stability assessment. This article proposes a novel temporal-adaptive intelligent system (IS) for post-fault short-term voltage stability (STVS) assessment. Unlike existing methods using a single learning algorithm, the proposed IS incorporates multiple randomized learning algorithms in an ensemble form, including random vector functional link networks and extreme learning machine, to obtain a more diversified machine learning outcome. Moreover, under a multi-objective optimization programming framework, the STVS is assessed in an optimized temporal-adaptive way to balance STVS accuracy and speed. The simulation results on New England 39-bus system and Nordic test system verify its superiority over a single learning algorithm and its excellent accuracy and speed without increased computational efficiency. In particular, its real-time assessment speed is 27.5&#x2013;37.3&#x0025; faster than the single algorithm based methods. Given such faster assessment speed, the proposed method can enable earlier and more timely stability control (load shedding) for less load shedding amount and stronger effectiveness.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Accurate clock synchronization in the industr-ial-Internet-of-Things systems forms the cornerstone of distributed interaction and coordination among various infrastructures and machines in an industrial environment. However, due to the widespread use of wireless networks in industrial applications, constraints inherent to wireless networks including uncertain propagation delays, random packets losses, and unguaranteed communication resources are unavoidable, leading to dramatically increased clock synchronization error and unreliable or even outdated information. Meanwhile, time information transmissions are vulnerable to suffer from malicious attacks, causing unreliable timestamps and insecure synchronization. In this article, we proposed a distributed clock synchronization protocol based on an intelligent clustering algorithm to achieve accurate, secure, and packet-efficient clock synchronization. The varying rate of skew of every clock is collected and utilized for cluster formation as well as malicious node detection. According to established clusters, various synchronization frequencies are assigned, which can avoid excessive network access contention, reduce overall communication resource consumption, and improve synchronization accuracy. Meanwhile, a two-tier fault detection algorithm consists of outlier detection and second-order regressive model prediction is applied to determine potential malicious nodes. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol overwhelms simultaneous synchronization protocols in terms of synchronization performance and faulty node detection.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to the uncertainty of intermittent energy and system load, it is a big challenge to optimally operate an isolated power system. This article proposes a two-stage optimal operation strategy with a Takagi&#x2013;Sugeno&#x2013;Kang (TSK) fuzzy system to address the supply security under uncertainty circumstance. For proper analysis of the uncertainty characteristics, adjustable uncertainty parameters of intermittent energy resource and system load are taken as fuzzy sets; with the consideration of the robustness of these uncertainty parameters on isolated power system, it creates a supply-security identification model with the TSK fuzzy approach under radial basis function (RBF) neural network, and deduces optimal weight values with a recursive least square method. For properly avoiding potential risks, security index is classified into several degrees, each degree of risk can switch a different operation model, which can ensure the supply security of an isolated power system. For properly solving the optimization model, gradient descent-based multiobjective cultural differential evolution is employed to minimize economic cost and emission rate simultaneously. With simulations on isolated regional network, the obtained results reveal that the proposed method can be a viable alternative for optimal operation in isolated power systems.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the popularization of intelligent terminals, especially current trends, such as &#x201c;Industrie 4.0&#x201d; and the Internet of Things, mobile crowdsensing is becoming one of the promising applications built on smart devices in mobile networks. However, the existing mobile crowdsensing models are mostly based on a centralized platform, which is not fully trusted in reality and results in the existence of fraud and other security problems. Furthermore, the data quality collected through crowdsensing is varied, and the location privacy is difficult to guarantee, especially at the worker selection stage. To solve these two problems, an effective blockchain-based location-privacy-preserving crowdsensing model, CrowdBLPS, is proposed in this article. First, the idea of a blockchain is introduced into this model. The decentralized structure and the consensus approach are applied to realize the nonrepudiation and nontampering of information. Second, to improve the data sensing quality and protect worker privacy, a two-stage approach, including the preregistration stage and the final selection stage, is proposed. Finally, we further implement a prototype on the Ethereum public testing network, and the experimental results show the feasibility, availability, and reliability of CrowdBLPS.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this issue of JAMA, Lee and colleagues examine the association between Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST), which involve portable medical orders that document treatment limitations for out-of-hospital emergency care and for limiting overtreatment at the end of life. The authors studied adults with chronic life-limiting illnesses who were hospitalized within the last 6 months of life and who had completed a POLST before their last inpatient admission. Among 1818 patients enrolled, 656 (36%) had POLST orders for &#8220;full treatment&#8221; and 1162 had orders for either &#8220;limited additional interventions&#8221; (761 [42%]) or &#8220;comfort measures only&#8221; (401 [22%]). Among the combined latter 2 groups, 472 (41%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 436 (38%) received POLST-discordant intensive care, and 204 (18%) received POLST-discordant life-sustaining treatments, defined as mechanical ventilation, vasoactive infusions, new renal replacement therapy, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Patients with cancer or dementia were less likely to receive POLST-discordant intensive care, whereas patients hospitalized for traumatic injuries were more likely to receive POLST-discordant intensive care. These results are sobering.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Energy storage units (such as battery or ultracapacitor) can help to reduce the power fluctuation in the impedance source network converter applications such as the photovoltaic (PV) and fuel cells systems. Due to the unknown dynamic characteristics of the energy stored impedance network, the unexpected oscillation and inrush currents in dynamic process might threaten the storage device safety. In this article, an energy stored quasi-Z-source converter with the battery is modeled and analyzed including the transient capacitor current. The impact of the network internal resonance on the battery current control loop is mathematically explored. The resulted conflict between the zero steady-state error and bandwidth requirement is revealed. That yields the sacrifice and limitation of the closed-loop dynamic performance in the conventional methods. An active damping technique is then proposed to ensure the extended bandwidth and better dynamic performances under different state of charge (SOC) occasions. The theoretical analysis and performance are both verified by the simulations and experiments.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Current flow controllers (CFCs) are power electronics-based devices that may remove some technical barriers preventing multiterminal high-voltage direct current (MTdc) grid deployment. In this paper, an interline CFC topology is investigated. The single H-bridge CFC (1B-CFC) alters the grid power flow by transferring power between neighboring dc lines. The operation and control of a 1B-CFC under a single modulation scheme is presented. A control strategy has been proposed to provide pole balancing support during imbalance conditions. Small-scale prototypes have been developed to demonstrate the functionality and operational range of the device. To this end, an experimental MTdc grid test-rig has been employed. It is shown that a 1B-CFC could be used to limit the dc line current and, additionally, it can be employed to enable asymmetrical tapping of dc lines. For completeness, the performance of the device has been experimentally validated under line overloading, pole imbalance conditions, and a pole-to-pole dc fault.

This paper proposes uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE)-based control with output feedback for FWAV systems. The approach enables the acquisition of the approximate plant model with only a partial knowledge of system parameters. For the design of the controller, only the bandwidth information of the unknown plant model is needed, which is available through the UDE filter. The stability analysis of the closed-loop system with the UDE-based controller is presented. It is shown that the proposed control scheme can ensure the boundedness of the control signals. A number of numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the satisfactory trajectory tracking performance of the proposed method.

<p>This article presents a sequential fusion approach for state estimation of networked multisensor nonlinear systems, where sensors and estimators are allowed to work asynchronously. Both sequential measurement fusion (SMF) and sequential state fusion (SSF) estimators are designed, where the unscented filtering method is used in the design of the local SMF estimator, and the matrix weighting method is applied in the design of the SSF estimator. It is shown that the proposed SSF estimators provide a satisfactory estimation precision that is close to the centralized batch state fusion (BSF) estimator, while requiring smaller computation burden as compared with the BSF estimator. Both simulations and experiments of a moving target tracking system are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed sequential fusion methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fault diagnosis, which identifies the root cause of the observed out-of-control status, is essential to counteracting or eliminating faults in industrial processes. Many conventional data-driven fault diagnosis methods ignore the fault tendency of abnormal samples, and they need a complete retraining process to include the newly collected abnormal samples or fault classes. In this article, a broad convolutional neural network (BCNN) is designed with incremental learning capability for solving the aforementioned issues. The proposed method combines several consecutive samples as a data matrix, and it then extracts both fault tendency and nonlinear structure from the obtained data matrix by using convolutional operation. After that, the weights in fully connected layers can be trained based on the obtained features and their corresponding fault labels. Because of the architecture of this network, the diagnosis performance of the BCNN model can be improved by adding newly generated additional features. Finally, the incremental learning capability of the proposed method is also designed, so that the BCNN model can update itself to include new coming abnormal samples and fault classes. The proposed method is applied both to a simulated process and a real industrial process. Experimental results illustrate that it can better capture the characteristics of the fault process, and effectively update diagnosis model to include new coming abnormal samples, and fault classes.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>People constantly share their photographs with others through various social media sites. With the aid of the privacy settings provided by social media sites, image owners can designate scope of sharing, e.g., close friends and acquaintances. However, even if the owner of a photograph carefully sets the privacy setting to exclude a given individual who is not supposed to see the photograph, the photograph may still eventually reach a wider audience, including those clearly undesired through unanticipated channels of disclosure, causing a privacy breach. Moreover, it is often the case that a given image involves multiple stakeholders who are also depicted in the photograph. Due to various personalities, it is even more challenging to reach agreement on the privacy settings for these multi-owner photographs. In this paper, we propose a privacy risk reminder system, called REMIND, which estimates the probability that a shared photograph may be seen by unwanted people-through the social graph-who are not included in the original sharing list. We tackle this problem from a novel angle by digging into the big data regarding image sharing history. Specifically, the social media providers possess a huge amount of image sharing information (e.g., what photographs are shared with whom) of their users. By analyzing and modeling such rich information, we build a sophisticated probability model that efficiently aggregates the image disclosure probabilities along different possible image propagation chains and loops. If the computed disclosure probability indicates high risks of privacy breach, a reminder is issued to the image owner to help revise the privacy settings (or, at least, inform the user about this accidental disclosure risk). The proposed REMIND system also has a nice feature of policy harmonization that helps resolve privacy differences in multi-owner photographs. We have carried out a user study to validate the rationale of our proposed solutions and also conducte-
 experimental studies to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed REMIND system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The side-channel leakage is a consequence of program execution in a computer processor, and understanding relationship between code execution and information leakage is a necessary step in estimating information leakage and its capacity limits. This paper proposes a methodology to relate program execution to electromagnetic side-channel emanations and estimates side-channel information capacity created by execution of series of instructions (e.g., a function, a procedure, or a program) in a processor. To model dependence among program instructions in a code, we propose to use Markov source model, which includes the dependencies among sequence of instructions as well as dependencies among instructions as they pass through a pipeline of the processor. The emitted electromagnetic (EM) signals during instruction executions are natural choice for the inputs into the model. To obtain the channel inputs for the proposed model, we derive a mathematical relationship between the emanated instruction signal power (ESP) and total emanated signal power while running a program. Then, we derive the leakage capacity of EM side channels created by execution of series of instructions in a processor. Finally, we provide experimental results to demonstrate that leakages could be severe and that a dedicated attacker could obtain important information.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

<p>Online romance scams are a prevalent form of mass-marketing fraud in the West, and yet few studies have presented data-driven responses to this problem. In this type of scam, fraudsters craft fake profiles and manually interact with their victims. Because of the characteristics of this type of fraud and how dating sites operate, traditional detection methods (e.g., those used in spam filtering) are ineffective. In this paper, we investigate the archetype of online dating profiles used in this form of fraud, including their use of demographics, profile descriptions, and images, shedding light on both the strategies deployed by scammers to appeal to victims and the traits of victims themselves. Furthermore, in response to the severe financial and psychological harm caused by dating fraud, we develop a system to detect romance scammers on online dating platforms. This paper presents the first fully described system for automatically detecting this fraud. Our aim is to provide an early detection system to stop romance scammers as they create fraudulent profiles or before they engage with potential victims. Previous research has indicated that the victims of romance scams score highly on scales for idealized romantic beliefs. We combine a range of structured, unstructured, and deep-learned features that capture these beliefs in order to build a detection system. Our ensemble machine-learning approach is robust to the omission of profile details and performs at high accuracy (97%) in a hold-out validation set. The system enables development of automated tools for dating site providers and individual users.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We investigate the effect of outdated channel state information (CSI) on the secrecy performance of wireless-powered untrusted relay networks, in which the relay is a potential eavesdropper. To keep the information secret from this untrusted relay, the destination sends a jamming signal to the relay when the source transmits an information signal. At the same time, the relay harvests energy from the radio-frequency power, and forwards the received signals to the destination using this harvested energy. To determine the proportions of energy harvesting and information processing, the relay makes use of relaying based on power splitting or time switching policy. Although the destination tries to remove the jamming signal from the relaying signal, it cannot cancel out the jamming signal perfectly due to imperfect channel reciprocity caused by the outdated CSI; this residual jamming signal therefore has a negative impact on secrecy performance. In this scenario, we derive the closed-form expressions for the outage probability and average secrecy rate, and find the jamming power ratio, power splitting ratio, and time switching ratio to optimize these secrecy performance metrics. The numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of our analysis, and show that the proposed secure relaying protocols achieve a near-optimal secrecy performance, as well as outperforming the conventional scheme without the jamming power control.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In recent years there has been an increasing interest in sensing devices that capture multidimensional information such as the spectral light field (SLF) images, which are 5-dimensional (5D) representations of a scene including 2D spatial, 2D angular and 1D spectral information. Spatio-spectral and angular information plays an important role in modern applications spanning from microscopy to computer vision. However, SLF sensors use expensive beam-splitters or cameras arrays placed in tandem, which split the sensing problem in two time consuming and independent tasks: spectral and light field imaging tasks. This work proposes a compressive spectral light field imaging architecture that builds on the principles of the compressive imaging framework, to capture multiplexed representations of the multidimensional information, so that, less measurements are required to capture the SLF data cube. Alongside, we propose a computational algorithm to recover the 5D information from the compressed measurements, exploiting the inherent high correlations within the SLF by treating them as 3D tensors. Furthermore, exploiting the geometry properties of the proposed optical architecture, the Tucker decomposition is applied to the set of compressed measurements, so that, an ad-hoc dictionary-like image representation basis is calculated online. This in turn, entails a more accurate reconstruction of the SLF since the dictionary fits the specific characteristics of the image itself. We demonstrate through simulations over three SLF datasets captured in our laboratory, and an experimental proof-of-concept implementation, that the proposed compressive imaging device together with the proposed computational algorithm represent an efficient alternative to capture SLF, compared to conventional methods that employ either side-information or multiple sensors. Also, we show that the tensor-based proposed algorithm exhibits a lower computational complexity than the matrix-based state of the -
rt counterparts, thus enabling fast processing of multidimensional images.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Benefiting from the quick development of deep convolutional neural networks, especially fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), remarkable progresses have been achieved on salient object detection recently. Nevertheless, these FCNs based methods are still challenging to generate high resolution saliency maps, and also not applicable for subsequent applications due to their heavy model weights. In this paper, we propose a compact and efficient deep network with high accuracy for salient object detection. Firstly, we propose two strategies for initial prediction, one is a new designed multi-scale context module, the other is incorporating hand-crafted saliency priors. Secondly, we employ residual learning to refine it progressively by only learning the residual in each side-output, which can be achieved with few convolutional parameters, therefore leads to high compactness and high efficiency. Finally, we further design a novel top-down reverse attention block to guide the above side-output residual learning. Specifically, the current predicted salient regions are used to erase its side-output feature, thus the missing object parts and details can be efficiently learned from these unerased regions, which results in more complete detection and high accuracy. Extensive experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed network performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches, and shows advantages in simplicity, compactness and efficiency.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Seismic image interpolation is a currently popular research subject in modern reflection seismology. The interpolation problem is generally treated as a process of inversion. Under the compressed sensing framework, various sparse transformations and low-rank constraints based methods have great performances in recovering irregularly missing traces. However, in the case of regularly missing traces, their applications are limited because of the strong spatial aliasing energies. In addition, the erratic noise always poses a serious impact on the interpolation results obtained by the sparse transformations and low-rank constraints-based methods,. This is because the erratic noise is far from satisfying the statistical assumption behind these methods. In this study, we propose a mathematical morphology-based interpolation technique, which constrains the morphological scale of the model in the inversion process. The inversion problem is solved by the shaping regularization approach. The mathematical morphological constraint (MMC)-based interpolation technique has a satisfactory robustness to the spatial aliasing and erratic energies. We provide a detailed algorithmic framework and discuss the extension from 2D to higher dimensional version and the back operator in the shaping inversion. A group of numerical examples demonstrates the successful performance of the proposed technique.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The human visual system tends to consider saliency of an object as a whole. Some object-level saliency detection methods have been proposed by leveraging object proposals in bounding boxes, and regarding the entire bounding box as one candidate salient region. However, the bounding boxes can not provide exact object position and a lot of pixels in bounding boxes belong to the background. Consequently, background pixels in bounding box also show high saliency. Besides, acquiring object proposals needs high time cost. In order to compute object-level saliency, we consider region growing from some seed superpixels, to find one surrounding region which probably represents the whole object. The desired surrounding region has similar appearance inside and obvious difference with the outside, which is proposed as maximally stable region (MSR) in this paper. In addition, one effective seed superpixel selection strategy is presented to improve speed. MSR based saliency detection is more robust than pixel or superpixel level methods and object proposal based methods. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods at 50 FPS. Compared with deep learning based methods, we show worse performance, but with about 1200-1600 times faster, which means better trade-off between performance and speed.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we develop a concise but efficient network architecture called linear compressing based skip-connecting network (LCSCNet) for image super-resolution. Compared with two representative network architectures with skip connections, ResNet and DenseNet, a linear compressing layer is designed in LCSCNet for skip connection, which connects former feature maps and distinguishes them from newly-explored feature maps. In this way, the proposed LCSCNet enjoys the merits of the distinguish feature treatment of DenseNet and the parameter-economic form of ResNet. Moreover, to better exploit hierarchical information from both low and high levels of various receptive fields in deep models, inspired by gate units in LSTM, we also propose an adaptive element-wise fusion strategy with multi-supervised training. Experimental results in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms validate the effectiveness of LCSCNet.
