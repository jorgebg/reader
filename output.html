<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Power non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been considered as a new enabling technology in 5G communication. In this paper, we introduce the problem of pilot contamination attack (PCA) on NOMA in millimeter wave (mmWave) and massive MIMO 5G communication. Due to the new characteristics of NOMA such as superposed signals with multi-users, PCA detection faces new challenges. By harnessing the sparseness and statistics of mmWave and massive MIMO virtual channel, we propose two effective PCA detection schemes for NOMA tackling static and dynamic environments, respectively. For the static environment, the problem of PCA detection is formulated as a binary hypothesis test of the virtual channel sparsity. For the dynamic environment, the statistic of the peaks in the virtual channel is leveraged to distinguish the contamination state from the normal state. A peak estimation algorithm and a machine learning based detection framework are proposed to achieve high detection performance. To further optimize the proposed scheme, a feature selection algorithm and an optimization model considering the detection accuracy and detection delay are presented. Simulation results evaluate and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed detection schemes. The detection rate can approach 100&#x0025; with 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> false alarm rate in the static environment and above 95&#x0025; in the dynamic environment under various system parameters.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Connected Components Labeling is an essential step of many Image Processing and Computer Vision tasks. Since the first proposal of a labeling algorithm, which dates back to the sixties, many approaches have optimized the computational load needed to label an image. In particular, the use of decision forests and state prediction have recently appeared as valuable strategies to improve performance. However, due to the overhead of the manual construction of prediction states and the size of the resulting machine code, the application of these strategies has been restricted to small masks, thus ignoring the benefit of using a block-based approach. In this paper, we combine a block-based mask with state prediction and code compression: the resulting algorithm is modeled as a Directed Rooted Acyclic Graph with multiple entry points, which is automatically generated without manual intervention. When tested on synthetic and real datasets, in comparison with optimized implementations of state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed approach shows superior performance, surpassing the results obtained by all compared approaches in all settings.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>While analyzing the performance of state-of-the-art R-CNN based generic object detectors, we find that the detection performance for objects with low object-region-percentages (ORPs) of the bounding boxes are much lower than the overall average. Elongated objects are examples. To address the problem of low ORPs for elongated object detection, we propose a hybrid approach which employs a Faster R-CNN to achieve robust detections of object parts, and a novel model-driven clustering algorithm to group the related partial detections and suppress false detections. First, we train a Faster R-CNN with partial region proposals of suitable and stable ORPs. Next, we introduce a deep CNN (DCNN) for orientation classification on the partial detections. Then, on the outputs of the Faster R-CNN and DCNN, the algorithm of adaptive model-driven clustering first initializes a model of an elongated object with a data-driven process on local partial detections, and refines the model iteratively by model-driven clustering and data-driven model updating. By exploiting Faster R-CNN to produce robust partial detections and model-driven clustering to form a global representation, our method is able to generate a tight oriented bounding box for elongated object detection. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on two typical elongated objects in the COCO dataset, and other typical elongated objects, including rigid objects (pens, screwdrivers and wrenches) and non-rigid objects (cracks). Experimental results show that, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a large margin of improvements for both detection and localization of elongated objects in images.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Convolutional operator learning is gaining attention in many signal processing and computer vision applications. Learning kernels has mostly relied on so-called patch-domain approaches that extract and store many overlapping patches across training signals. Due to memory demands, patch-domain methods have limitations when learning kernels from large datasets &#x2013; particularly with multi-layered structures, e.g., convolutional neural networks &#x2013; or when applying the learned kernels to high-dimensional signal recovery problems. The so-called convolution approach does not store many overlapping patches, and thus overcomes the memory problems particularly with careful algorithmic designs; it has been studied within the &#x201c;synthesis&#x201d; signal model, e.g., convolutional dictionary learning. This paper proposes a new convolutional analysis operator learning (CAOL) framework that learns an analysis sparsifying regularizer with the convolution perspective, and develops a new convergent Block Proximal Extrapolated Gradient method using a Majorizer (BPEG-M) to solve the corresponding block multi-nonconvex problems. To learn diverse filters within the CAOL framework, this paper introduces an orthogonality constraint that enforces a tight-frame filter condition, and a regularizer that promotes diversity between filters. Numerical experiments show that, with sharp majorizers, BPEG-M significantly accelerates the CAOL convergence rate compared to the state-of-the-art block proximal gradient (BPG) method. Numerical experiments for sparse-view computational tomography show that a convolutional sparsifying regularizer learned via CAOL significantly improves reconstruction quality compared to a conventional edge-preserving regularizer. Using more and wider kernels in a learned regularizer better preserves edges in reconstructed images.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Tone Mapping Operators (TMO) designed for videos can be classified into two categories. In a first approach, TMOs are temporal filtered to reduce temporal artifacts and provide a Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) content with improved temporal consistency. This however does not improve the SDR coding Rate Distortion (RD) performances. A second approach is to design the TMO with the goal of optimizing the SDR coding rate-distortion performances. This second category of methods may lead to SDR videos altering the artistic intent compared with the produced HDR content. In this paper, we combine the benefits of the two approaches by introducing new Weighted Prediction (WP) methods inside the HEVC SDR codec. As a first step, we demonstrate the interest of the WP methods compared to TMO optimized for RD performances. Then we present the newly introduced WP algorithm and WP modes. The WP algorithm consists in performing a global motion compensation between frames using an optical flow, and the new modes are based on non linear functions in contrast with the literature using only linear functions. The contribution of each novelty is studied independently and in a second time they are all put in competition to maximize the RD performances. Tests were made for HDR backward compatible compression but also for SDR compression only. In both cases, the proposed WP methods improve the RD performances while maintaining the SDR temporal coherency.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Finding suitable image representations for the task at hand is critical in computer vision. Different approaches extending the original Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) model have recently been proposed to offer rotation-invariant feature learning. In this paper, we present an extended novel RBM that learns rotation invariant features by explicitly factorizing for rotation nuisance in 2D image inputs within an unsupervised framework. While the goal is to learn invariant features, our model infers an orientation per input image during training, using information related to the reconstruction error. The training process is regularised by a Kullback-Leibler divergence, offering stability and consistency. We used the  $gamma $ -score, a measure that calculates the amount of invariance, to mathematically and experimentally demonstrate that our approach indeed learns rotation invariant features. We show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art RBM approaches for rotation invariant feature learning on three different benchmark datasets, by measuring the performance with the test accuracy of an SVM classifier. Our implementation is available at https://bitbucket.org/tuttoweb/rotinvrbm.

<p>Previous work presented a theoretical model based on the implicit Bitcoin
specification for how an entity might issue a protocol native cryptocurrency
that mimics features of fiat currencies. Protocol native means that it is built
into the blockchain platform itself and is not simply a token running on
another platform. Novel to this work were mechanisms by which the issuing
entity could manage the cryptocurrency but where their power was limited and
transparency was enforced by the cryptocurrency being implemented using a
publicly mined blockchain. In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of this
theoretical model by implementing such a managed cryptocurrency architecture
through forking the Bitcoin code base. We discovered that the theoretical model
contains several vulnerabilities and security issues that needed to be
mitigated. It also contains architectural features that presented significant
implementation challenges; some aspects of the proposed changes to the Bitcoin
specification were not practical or even workable. In this work we describe how
we mitigated the security vulnerabilities and overcame the architectural
hurdles to build a working prototype.

<p>The widespread adoption of Internet of Things has led to many security
issues. Recently, there have been malware attacks on IoT devices, the most
prominent one being that of Mirai. IoT devices such as IP cameras, DVRs and
routers were compromised by the Mirai malware and later large-scale DDoS
attacks were propagated using those infected devices (bots) in October 2016. In
this research, we develop a network-based algorithm which can be used to detect
IoT bots infected by Mirai or similar malware in large-scale networks (e.g. ISP
network). The algorithm particularly targets bots scanning the network for
vulnerable devices since the typical scanning phase for botnets lasts for
months and the bots can be detected much before they are involved in an actual
attack. We analyze the unique signatures of the Mirai malware to identify its
presence in an IoT device. The prospective deployment of our bot detection
solution is discussed next along with the countermeasures which can be taken
post detection. Further, to optimize the usage of computational resources, we
use a two-dimensional (2D) packet sampling approach, wherein we sample the
packets transmitted by IoT devices both across time and across the devices.
Leveraging the Mirai signatures identified and the 2D packet sampling approach,
a bot detection algorithm is proposed. Subsequently, we use testbed
measurements and simulations to study the relationship between bot detection
delays and the sampling frequencies for device packets. Finally, we derive
insights from the obtained results and use them to design our proposed bot
detection algorithm.

<p>The rotor structure of synchronous reluctance machines (SynRel) is conventionally retained mechanically by iron ribs. In this paper, a novel structure for high-speed synchronous reluctance rotor is presented. The novelty of this paper is the proof of a concept of SynRel machine without iron ribs. Structurally, the rotor iron lamination segments are embedded in an adhesive resin material with high temperature resistance and mechanical strength. Three four-pole SynRel machines have been designed with the target of improving motor torque, and compared for different ribs configuration. It has been shown that the proposed motor performs enhanced torque, power factor, and efficiency with respect to conventional SynRel with iron ribs. An extensive sensitivity analysis of the ribless rotor geometry is carried out, followed by both mechanical analysis and experimental over speed test to guarantee its robustness above the operating speed range. The manufacturing procedure of this novel rotor is introduced. Finally, the experimental results on both SynRel prototypes are presented, showing the increase in torque, power factor, and efficiency of the proposed solution. This paper is a first step toward the definition of a viable and novel solution of SynRel machines with improved performance.

<p>Squirrel-cage induction motor (SQIM) fed by a pulsewidth modulated voltage source inverter (VSI) is subjected to voltage and current surges. It may cause additional losses in the motor, insulation failure, high bearing current, and electromagnetic interference. To mitigate these problems, sinusoidal LC filter is placed at the ac-side of the VSI. This paper proposes a new methodology to design the filter. In this method, the filter inductance is chosen based on the maximum ripple in the inverter ac-side current and the voltage drop across the filter inductor, and the filter capacitor is chosen based on the steady-state reactive power demand of the SQIM. The effects of the designed filter on the switch current, losses in the drive, temperature of the dc-link capacitor, dv&#x002f;dt at the motor terminal, stator flux, and air-gap torque of the SQIM are discussed. The performance of the drive with the filters, designed by the proposed method and the standard method, are experimentally tested on a two-level silicon carbide VSI-fed SQIM and comparative analysis is carried out. The impact of the designed filter on the drive is also shown when the neutral point of the filter capacitors is connected with the mid-point of the dc link. The stability of the closed-loop controlled SQIM drive with the proposed filter, and simulation results are presented to verify its performance.

<p>For high-speed permanent magnet machines (HSPMMs), the permanent magnet (PM) is more likely to suffer irreversible demagnetization because the heat dissipation is serious in the HSPMMs, especially for the high-power machines. This paper focuses on the comprehensive research results on the power loss and thermal characteristic for a high-power HSPMM. First, the power loss at the rated load is investigated by finite-element analysis. Then, the temperature distribution of four cooling schemes is compared by the electromagnetic-thermal iteration calculation. The effect of different parameters on thermal behavior is obtained to reduce rotor temperature, which includes an examination of the axial flow duct, cooling medium, sleeve thickness, and sleeve thermal conductivity. Finally, an improved loss separation method is employed to obtain the loss distribution from the measured total loss, and the comprehensive experiments are implemented based on one HSPMM prototype (800 kW, 15 000 rpm) to verify the related theoretical analysis.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The fast detection of magnitude, frequency, and phase angle of the fundamental-frequency component is very useful in many three-phase power system applications. Most techniques to accomplish this task are based on different versions of three-phase phase-locked loop (PLL) schemes. Some variables of three-phase systems may experience phase angle jumps after some disturbances. In this paper, a method for the fast detection of phase angle jump occurrence, estimation of the phase angle jump, and its use for improving the performance of the generalized delayed signal cancelation (GDSC) PLL is proposed. The proposed method is based on the detailed evaluation of the GDSC filter transient behavior after a phase jump. Results considering typical three-phase grid disturbances are used to evaluate the proposed scheme, in comparison with other usual PLL techniques. The use of the proposed phase jump angle estimator allowed a reduction in the GDSC-PLL convergence time of about 50&#x0025;.

Different from the traditional fault-tolerant saturated controllers, the proposed control approach explicitly accounts for the control input constraints with straightforward tuning parameters in controller. Meanwhile, the exact knowledge of the actuator failures is not required and uncertain failure information can be rejected. A smooth control signal containing simple saturation functions is designed, and the unknown bounded external disturbances can be rejected by the proposed method. The proposed controller can ensure ultimately, uniformly bounded stability of the closed-loop system, where relative pose and velocities converge to the small neighborhoods of zero. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Industrial gas leaks cause accidents and pose threats to the environment and human life. Thus, it is essential to detect gas leaks in time. Usually, the abnormal concentration signals are defined by a fixed concentration value, such as 25&#x0025; of the lower explosive limit. However, it is difficult to accumulate to the fixed point quickly when the leak is small. In addition, the actual leak signals are seldom available, making many data classifications inoperable. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a detection approach using the auto-correlation function (ACF) of the normal concentration segment. The feature of each normal segment is obtained by calculating the correlation coefficients between ACFs. According to the features of statistical analysis, a nonconcentration threshold is determined to detect the real-time signals. In addition, the weighted fusion algorithm based on the distance between the sensors and virtual leak source is used to fuse multisensory data. The proposed method has been implemented in a field by building a wireless sensor network. It is confirmed that the system detection rate reaches as high as 96.7&#x0025; and the average detection time delay is less than 30&#x00a0;s on the premise of low false alarm rate.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes an open-loop approach for selective harmonic detection from the single-phase power system under changeable frequency environment. It consists of a frequency tracking algorithm relying on a fixed tuned demodulation method and a selective harmonic detection scheme based on an adaptively tuned cascaded delayed signal cancellation (CDSC) strategy. It can be easily arranged to detect one or several harmonic(s) from the input signal contaminated by different harmonics. The open-loop configuration makes the proposed technique robust, free of interdependent loop, easy tuning, and unconditionally stable. The real-time utilization of trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions is also avoided in the technique. When compared with the discrete Fourier transform and CDSC-based technique reported in the technical literature, it demands less computational effort and can create faster dynamics and better steady-state accuracy in the estimated frequency. The usefulness of the technique is confirmed by simulation and real-time experimental results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose an approach to estimate and quantify the degree of extraversion for crowd motion based on individual trajectories. Extraversion is a typical personality that is often observed in human behaviors. We present a composite motion descriptor, which integrates the basic motion information and social metrics, to describe the extraversion of each individual in a crowd. In order to train a universal scoring function that can measure the degrees of extraversion, we incorporate the active learning technique with the relative attribute approach based on the social grouping behavior in crowd motions. In addition, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method by measuring the degree of extraversion for real individual trajectories in a crowd and analyzing crowd scenes from a real-world dataset.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the pervasive introduction of Internet of Everything (IoE) technologies, use cases are frequently being found operating within harsh environmental conditions. This decreases the need for solutions that permit service delivery to operate in a highly resilient manner. This paper presents an architecture for a novel cloud platform designed for resilient service delivery. It supports networks where poor communication links or high node failure will cause services to be delivered in an nonresilient manner. This could be the result of factors such as high node mobility, poor environmental conditions, and unreliable infrastructure from environment disaster or cyber-attack. This biologically inspired architecture uses a purely distributed multiagent approach to provide self-healing and self-organizing properties, modeled on the characteristics of embryonic development and biological cell communication. To permit high levels of a node churn, this multiagent approach uses local-only communication. Probabilistic cellular automata are used to simulate this architecture and evaluate the efficacy of this approach.

<p>The connection of physical agriculture with corresponding cyber systems is helpful to achieve precision agriculture. Real-time data from agriculture sensors can provide decision supports to improve the yields and quality of agricultural products, but also bring about challenges one of which is how to mine useful information from these vast amounts of data at acceptable computation costs. To deal with the dimension disaster problem faced by most conventional mining algorithms, in this paper we combine granulation techniques and genetic algorithm (GA) with a support vector machine (SVM) to propose a granular GA-SVM. In the integrated predictor, three granulation methods, that is, Min&#x2013;Median&#x2013;Max granulation, Quartile&#x2013;Median granulation, and fuzzy granulation, are introduced to break down big data in agricultural cyber-physical systems into small-scale granules, and GA is used to find the optimal values of SVM penalty parameter and kernel parameter from the reduced granules. Internet of Things (IoT) data from Luochuan Apple Experimental Demonstration Station in Shaanxi Province, China, verified that the proposed granular GA-SVM predictor is effective to make big data prediction with reduced computation time and equivalent accuracy. Moreover, the predicted environment information could provide guidance for growers achieving precise management of apple planting.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>People constantly share their photographs with others through various social media sites. With the aid of the privacy settings provided by social media sites, image owners can designate scope of sharing, e.g., close friends and acquaintances. However, even if the owner of a photograph carefully sets the privacy setting to exclude a given individual who is not supposed to see the photograph, the photograph may still eventually reach a wider audience, including those clearly undesired through unanticipated channels of disclosure, causing a privacy breach. Moreover, it is often the case that a given image involves multiple stakeholders who are also depicted in the photograph. Due to various personalities, it is even more challenging to reach agreement on the privacy settings for these multi-owner photographs. In this paper, we propose a privacy risk reminder system, called REMIND, which estimates the probability that a shared photograph may be seen by unwanted people-through the social graph-who are not included in the original sharing list. We tackle this problem from a novel angle by digging into the big data regarding image sharing history. Specifically, the social media providers possess a huge amount of image sharing information (e.g., what photographs are shared with whom) of their users. By analyzing and modeling such rich information, we build a sophisticated probability model that efficiently aggregates the image disclosure probabilities along different possible image propagation chains and loops. If the computed disclosure probability indicates high risks of privacy breach, a reminder is issued to the image owner to help revise the privacy settings (or, at least, inform the user about this accidental disclosure risk). The proposed REMIND system also has a nice feature of policy harmonization that helps resolve privacy differences in multi-owner photographs. We have carried out a user study to validate the rationale of our proposed solutions and also conducte-
 experimental studies to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed REMIND system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The side-channel leakage is a consequence of program execution in a computer processor, and understanding relationship between code execution and information leakage is a necessary step in estimating information leakage and its capacity limits. This paper proposes a methodology to relate program execution to electromagnetic side-channel emanations and estimates side-channel information capacity created by execution of series of instructions (e.g., a function, a procedure, or a program) in a processor. To model dependence among program instructions in a code, we propose to use Markov source model, which includes the dependencies among sequence of instructions as well as dependencies among instructions as they pass through a pipeline of the processor. The emitted electromagnetic (EM) signals during instruction executions are natural choice for the inputs into the model. To obtain the channel inputs for the proposed model, we derive a mathematical relationship between the emanated instruction signal power (ESP) and total emanated signal power while running a program. Then, we derive the leakage capacity of EM side channels created by execution of series of instructions in a processor. Finally, we provide experimental results to demonstrate that leakages could be severe and that a dedicated attacker could obtain important information.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a widely used tool for machine learning in distributed settings where a machine learning model is trained over distributed data sources through an interactive process of local computation and message passing. Such an iterative process could cause privacy concerns of data owners. The goal of this paper is to provide differential privacy for ADMM-based distributed machine learning. Prior approaches on differentially private ADMM exhibit low utility under high privacy guarantee and assume the objective functions of the learning problems to be smooth and strongly convex. To address these concerns, we propose a novel differentially private ADMM-based distributed learning algorithm called DP-ADMM, which combines an approximate augmented Lagrangian function with time-varying Gaussian noise addition in the iterative process to achieve higher utility for general objective functions under the same differential privacy guarantee. We also apply the moments accountant method to analyze the end-to-end privacy loss. The theoretical analysis shows that the DP-ADMM can be applied to a wider class of distributed learning problems, is provably convergent, and offers an explicit utility-privacy tradeoff. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to provide explicit convergence and utility properties for differentially private ADMM-based distributed learning algorithms. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can achieve good convergence and model accuracy under high end-to-end differential privacy guarantee.
