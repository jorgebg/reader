</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Lung cancer is the type of cancer that most often kills after the initial diagnosis. To aid the specialist in its diagnosis, temporal evaluation is a potential tool for analyzing indeterminate lesions, which may be benign or malignant, during treatment. With this goal in mind, a methodology is herein proposed for the analysis, quantification, and visualization of changes in lung lesions. This methodology uses a modified version of the quality threshold clustering algorithm to associate each voxel of the lesion to a cluster, and changes in the lesion over time are defined in terms of voxel moves to another cluster. In addition, statistical features are extracted for classification of the lesion as benign or malignant. To develop the proposed methodology, two databases of pulmonary lesions were used, one for malignant lesions in treatment (public) and the other for indeterminate cases (private). We determined that the density change percentage varied from 6.22% to 36.93% of lesion volume in the public database of malignant lesions under treatment and from 19.98% to 38.81% in the private database of lung nodules. Additionally, other inter-cluster density change measures were obtained. These measures indicate the degree of change in the clusters and how each of them is abundant in relation to volume. From the statistical analysis of regions in which the density changes occurred, we were able to discriminate lung lesions with an accuracy of 98.41%, demonstrating that these changes can indicate the true nature of the lesion. In addition to visualizing the density changes occurring in lesions over time, we quantified these changes and analyzed the entire set through volumetry, which is the technique most commonly used to analyze changes in pulmonary lesions.

<p>The weight of elephants living in zoos fluctuates over the course of their adult lives in cycles lasting around a hundred months, researchers at the University of Zurich have found. The fluctuation is linked to the particular pattern of tooth change in elephants, which results in them having more or less chewing surface available.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Now new data by UTSA shows how the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine changes when working for cocaine. Our brains naturally release dopamine to reward us for working hard for something gratifying, for example, enjoying a sweet piece of chocolate. Yet when it comes to illicit substances such as cocaine, the harder the effort put into getting cocaine, the less likely there will be a large jolt of dopamine.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, the problem of switched networked control systems (SNCSs) with external disturbance and actuator &#x002f;sensor faults is investigated. Meanwhile, the communication constraints such as network-induced delay, packet dropouts, and packet disorder are considered in a communication network. A robust adaptive sliding mode control method is proposed for disturbance damping and faults tolerance, which is designed on an observer and second-order discrete-time adaptive sliding mode function. Furthermore, the reachability of sliding motion is proved. Then, the networked predictive control method is employed to compensate the communication constraints. Finally, the stability of the closed-loop system is proved, and a numerical example and a mechanical system simulation example are executed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Extracting electric vehicle (EV) charging loads is an important aspect that enables smart grid operators to make informed and intelligent decisions about conserving power and promoting the reliability of the electrical grid. This paper presents an unsupervised algorithm to extract the EV charging loads (EVCLs) nonintrusively from the smart meter data. The proposed algorithm can run on low-frequency smart meter sampling data and only requires the real power measurement, which is the type of data communicated and recorded by most smart meters. Validation results on real aggregated household loads have shown that the proposed approach is a promising solution to extract EVCLs and that the approach can effectively mitigate the interference of other appliances that have similar load behaviors as EVs. Furthermore, the extraction of such load behaviors can be aggregated and open further smart grid analyses and studies.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>One of the major obstacles facing the large-scale integration of renewable energy sources to existing power networks is the large magnitude of fluctuations and uncertainties introduced to aggregated demand profiles. Such variations make the supply&#x2013;demand matching a more challenging task, and increase the operational cost of the power system. In this paper, we provide an effective, yet simple, methodology for smoothing power variations using the demand response of a large number of residential appliances. We first present a demand aggregation model based on queueing theory that can accommodate both deferrable and thermostatically controlled loads. Second, controllable demands are scheduled using an online algorithm to smooth the net noncontrollable demand profile. The performance of our methodology is evaluated using realistic data.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The inherent second-harmonic ripple power in a cascaded H-bridge (CHB)-based motor drive system poses the demand of large capacitors in the dc link of each cell. In this paper, an active power decoupling method based on negative sequence current injection and its corresponding dual voltage closed-loop control are proposed to solve this problem without adding any extra components. The proposed dual voltage closed-loop control system consists of a conventional active power control loop and a frequency-adaptive ripple power control loop. The ripple power control loop aims at injecting a set of negative sequence decoupling currents into the front ends of the cells to remove the ripple powers with variable frequency. Higher steady-state accuracy and robustness are, therefore, achieved compared to the open-loop control. Moreover, to simplify the control system, the ripple power control loop can be integrated into the active power control loop without introducing a harmonic reference frame transformation. By adopting the proposed control, the dc capacitance can be reduced to less than 10&#x0025; of the conventional case. The effectiveness and practicability of this method are verified by simulation and experimental results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a novel oversampling deadbeat current control approach for permanent magnet synchronous motor drives capable of operating at a controller sampling frequency multiple of the power converter switching frequency. Model-based controllers suffer from heavy computational demand and performance degradation due to parameter uncertainties. The proposed controller concurrently with field-programmable gate array implementation permits to achieve a constant switching frequency and an optimal current ripple along with a high current-loop bandwidth and robust behavior to parameter variation. A disturbance observer has been added to the proposed controller in order to compensate for the converter voltage distortions. The proposed control strategy is tested through both simulations and experiments.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>High step-up converters are required for distributed photovoltaic generation systems, due to the low voltage of the photovoltaic source. In this paper, a new hybrid high voltage gain dc&#x2013;dc converter is created by merging the standard boost converter with a coupled inductor and different switched-capacitor techniques. With a single switch and no requirement of higher duty cycle values, the proposed converter achieves a high voltage gain and high efficiency, in addition to lowered voltage and current stresses of the components. A 200-W prototype was implemented experimentally to evaluate the converter, which reached a maximum efficiency of 97.6&#x0025;.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The employment of solar microconverter allows a more detailed monitoring of the photovoltaic (PV) output power at the single module level; thus, machine learning techniques are capable to track the peculiarities of modules in the PV plants, such as regular shadings. In this way, it is possible to compare in real time the day-ahead forecast power with the actual one in order to better evaluate faults or anomalous trends that might have occurred in the PV plant. This paper presents a method for an effective fault diagnosis; this method is based on the day-ahead forecast of the output power from an existing PV module, linked to a microconverter, and on the outcome of the neighbor PV modules. Finally, this paper also proposes the analysis of the most common error definitions with new mathematical formulations, by comparing their effectiveness and immediate comprehension, in view of increasing power forecasting accuracy and performing both real-time and offline analysis of PV modules performance and possible faults.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Hyperspectral imagery collected from airborne or satellite sources inevitably suffers from spectral variability, making it difficult for spectral unmixing to accurately estimate abundance maps. The classical unmixing model, the linear mixing model (LMM), generally fails to handle this sticky issue effectively. To this end, we propose a novel spectral mixture model, called the augmented LMM, to address spectral variability by applying a data-driven learning strategy in inverse problems of hyperspectral unmixing. The proposed approach models the main spectral variability (i.e., scaling factors) generated by variations in illumination or typography separately by means of the endmember dictionary. It then models other spectral variabilities caused by environmental conditions (e.g., local temperature and humidity and atmospheric effects) and instrumental configurations (e.g., sensor noise), and material nonlinear mixing effects, by introducing a spectral variability dictionary. To effectively run the data-driven learning strategy, we also propose a reasonable prior knowledge for the spectral variability dictionary, whose atoms are assumed to be low-coherent with spectral signatures of endmembers, which leads to a well-known low-coherence dictionary learning problem. Thus, a dictionary learning technique is embedded in the framework of spectral unmixing so that the algorithm can learn the spectral variability dictionary and estimate the abundance maps simultaneously. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets are performed to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with the previous state-of-the-art methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a deep hashing framework, namely, unsupervised deep video hashing (UDVH), for large-scale video similarity search with the aim to learn compact yet effective binary codes. Our UDVH produces the hash codes in a self-taught manner by jointly integrating discriminative video representation with optimal code learning, where an efficient alternating approach is adopted to optimize the objective function. The key differences from most existing video hashing methods lie in: 1) UDVH is an unsupervised hashing method that generates hash codes by cooperatively utilizing feature clustering and a specifically designed binarization with the original neighborhood structure preserved in the binary space and 2) a specific rotation is developed and applied onto video features such that the variance of each dimension can be balanced, thus facilitating the subsequent quantization step. Extensive experiments performed on three popular video datasets show that the UDVH is overwhelmingly better than the state of the arts in terms of various evaluation metrics, which makes it practical in real-world applications.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In conventional wisdom of video modeling, the background is often treated as the primary target and foreground is derived using the technique of background subtraction. Based on the observation that foreground and background are two sides of the same coin, we propose to treat them as peer unknown variables and formulate a joint estimation problem, called Hierarchical modeling and Alternating Optimization (HMAO). The motivation behind our hierarchical extensions of background and foreground models is to better incorporate a priori knowledge about the disparity between background and foreground. For background, we decompose it into temporally low-frequency and high-frequency components for the purpose of better characterizing the class of video with dynamic background; for foreground, we construct a Markov random field prior at a spatially low resolution as the pivot to facilitate the noise-resilient refinement at higher resolutions. Built on hierarchical extensions of both models, we show how to successively refine their joint estimates under a unified framework known as alternating direction multipliers method. Experimental results have shown that our approach produces more discriminative background and demonstrates better robustness to noise than other competing methods. When compared against current state-of-the-art techniques, HMAO achieves at least comparable and often superior performance in terms of F-measure scores, especially for video containing dynamic and complex background.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Frontal view gait recognition for people identification has been carried out using single RGB, stereo RGB, Kinect 1.0, and Doppler radar. However, existing methods based on these camera technologies suffer from several problems. Therefore, we propose a four-part method for frontal view gait recognition based on the fusion of multiple features acquired from a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera. We have developed a gait data set captured by a ToF camera. The data set includes two sessions recorded seven months apart, with 46 and 33 subjects, respectively, each with six walks with five covariates. The four-part method includes: a new human silhouette extraction algorithm that reduces the multiple reflection problem experienced by ToF cameras; a frame selection method based on a new gait cycle detection algorithm; four new gait image representations; and a novel fusion classifier. Rigorous experiments are carried out to compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art methods. The results show distinct improvements over recognition rates for all covariates. The proposed method outperforms all major existing approaches for all covariates and results in 66.1% and 81.0% Rank 1 and Rank 5 recognition rates, respectively, in overall covariates, compared with a best state-of-the-art method performance of 35.7% and 57.7%.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Lung cancer is the type of cancer that most often kills after the initial diagnosis. To aid the specialist in its diagnosis, temporal evaluation is a potential tool for analyzing indeterminate lesions, which may be benign or malignant, during treatment. With this goal in mind, a methodology is herein proposed for the analysis, quantification, and visualization of changes in lung lesions. This methodology uses a modified version of the quality threshold clustering algorithm to associate each voxel of the lesion to a cluster, and changes in the lesion over time are defined in terms of voxel moves to another cluster. In addition, statistical features are extracted for classification of the lesion as benign or malignant. To develop the proposed methodology, two databases of pulmonary lesions were used, one for malignant lesions in treatment (public) and the other for indeterminate cases (private). We determined that the density change percentage varied from 6.22&#x0025; to 36.93&#x0025; of lesion volume in the public database of malignant lesions under treatment and from 19.98&#x0025; to 38.81&#x0025; in the private database of lung nodules. Additionally, other inter-cluster density change measures were obtained. These measures indicate the degree of change in the clusters and how each of them is abundant in relation to volume. From the statistical analysis of regions in which the density changes occurred, we were able to discriminate lung lesions with an accuracy of 98.41&#x0025;, demonstrating that these changes can indicate the true nature of the lesion. In addition to visualizing the density changes occurring in lesions over time, we quantified these changes and analyzed the entire set through volumetry, which is the technique most commonly used to analyze changes in pulmonary lesions.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Garbled circuits are general tools that allow two parties to compute any function without disclosing their respective inputs. Applications of this technique vary from distributed privacy-preserving machine learning tasks to secure outsourced authentication. Unfortunately, the energy cost of garbled circuit evaluation protocols is substantial. This limits the applicability of garbled circuits in scenarios that involve battery-operated devices, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and smartphones. In this paper, we propose MEG, a Memory- and Energy-efficient Garbled circuit evaluation mechanism. MEG utilizes batch data transmission and multi-threading to reduce memory and energy consumption. We implement MEG on an Android smartphone and compare its performance and energy consumption with state-of-the-art techniques using two garbled circuits of widely different sizes (AES-128 and 256-bit edit distance). Our results show that, compared with &#x201c;plain&#x201d; garbled circuit evaluation, MEG decreases memory consumption by more than 90%. When compared with current pipelined garbled circuit evaluation techniques, MEG's energy usage was 42% lower for AES-128 and 23% lower for EDT-256. Furthermore, our multi-thread implementation of MEG decreased circuit evaluation time by up to 56.7% for AES-128, and by up to 13.5% for EDT-256, compared with state-of-the-art pipelining techniques.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to its cost efficiency, the controller area network (CAN) is still the most wide-spread in-vehicle bus, and the numerous reported attacks demonstrate the urgency in designing new security solutions for CAN. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection mechanism that takes advantage of Bloom filtering to test frame periodicity based on message identifiers and parts of the data-field which facilitates detection of potential replay or modification attacks. This proves to be an effective approach since most of the traffic from in-vehicle buses is cyclic in nature and the format of the data-field is fixed due to rigid signal allocation. Bloom filters provide an efficient time-memory tradeoff which is beneficial for the constrained resources of automotive grade controllers. We test the correctness of our approach and obtain good results on an industry-standard CANoe-based simulation for a J1939 commercial-vehicle bus and also on CAN with flexible data-rate traces obtained from a real-world high-end vehicle. The proposed filtering mechanism is straightforward to adapt for any other time-triggered in-vehicle bus, e.g., FlexRay, since it is built on time-driven characteristics.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recently, near-infrared (NIR) images are increasingly being captured for recognizing faces in low-light/night-time conditions. Matching these images against the controlled high-resolution visible facial images usually present in the database is a challenging task. In surveillance scenarios, the NIR images can have very low resolution and also non-frontal pose which makes the problem even more challenging. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal dictionary alignment approach for addressing this problem. We also propose a re-ranking approach to further improve the recognition performance for each probe by combining the rank list given by the proposed algorithm with that given by another complementary feature/algorithm. Finally, we have also collected our own database Heterogeneous face recognition across Pose and Resolution (HPR) that has facial images captured from two surveillance quality NIR cameras and one high-resolution visible camera, with significant variations in head pose and resolution. Extensive experiments on the modified CASIA NIR-VIS 2.0 database, the Surveillance Camera face database, and our HPR database show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches and the collected database.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we consider user scheduling and power allocation techniques for downlinks where transmitted message must be kept confidential from all other unintended users and the number of users is larger than that of access point (AP) antennas. In order to maximize network secrecy rate with a limited number of antennas, the AP schedules a user who can achieve the largest secrecy rate and exploits multiple antennas for transmitting artificial noise to the unintended users. We derive the closed-form expressions of the optimal power allocation for the artificial noise and the average network secrecy rate through asymptotic analysis. The analysis results provide the insightful information on the behaviors of the user scheduling and the effect of system parameters on the network secrecy rate performance. It is shown that opportunistic scheduling with artificial noise transmission technique is more effective than the conventional precoding techniques for multiple confidential message transmissions in terms of network secrecy rate. Furthermore, we have also discussed a transmission strategy for the worst case scenarios where all unintended users are treated as colluding eavesdroppers. The simulations confirm the validity of the analysis results and provide additional information on the network performance in general cases.
