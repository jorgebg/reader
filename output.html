<p>Here is a quiz question for you&#8212;what is Cuba's main export? As many working in global health will know, it is medical professionals. Cuba brought in US$11 billion by leasing professional medical services around the world last year, compared with the $3 billion generated by the Cuban tourist industry. Some 30&#8200;000 Cuban health personnel work around the globe.

<p>Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are some of the most important human pathogens in the world yet developing countermeasures to them is challenging and rarely leads to licensed products. A small number of arbovirus vaccines, including yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis vaccines, have long been used to prevent disease.1,2 In 2016, a dengue vaccine was licensed to aid the control of dengue virus infections, which are responsible for an estimated 2 million severe disease cases and 21&#8200;000 deaths each year.

<p>Treatment with subcutaneously administered pegbelfermin for 16 weeks was generally well tolerated and significantly reduced hepatic fat fraction in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Further study of pegbelfermin is warranted in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Additional studies that use liver biopsies would allow for the assessment of pegbelfermin's effects on liver histology. Moreover, further studies should allow assessments of the safety and effectiveness of pegbelfermin in a larger number of patients.

<p>A 59-year-old man came to our hospital saying that he had been accidentally shot by a fellow hunter during an expedition to the local moorland. He was alone when he walked into the department. During physical examination he was found to be asymptomatic and all his vital signs were stable. His blood pressure was 125/75 mm Hg, and he did not complain of any dizziness or shortness of breath. Furthermore, no active bleeding was noted. An emergency whole-body CT (figure) was done and showed that shotgun pellets were evenly distributed in his body&#8212;from his knees to his neck&#8212;and that some had penetrated internally to affect several organs.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p><span class="paragraphSection">Health care expenditures continue to increase in the United States, and there have been considerable efforts over the past decade to use health policies, financial incentives, and alternative payment models to address this important issue. Starting in 2007, the Centers for Medicaid &amp; Medicare Services (CMS) sought to reduce early readmissions for common medical conditions among Medicare beneficiaries. The CMS policy approaches included increasing transparency through public reporting of hospital 30-day risk standardized readmission rates (2007-2009 discharges) starting in 2009 and providing financial incentives tied to readmissions though the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), passed under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The HRRP imposed financial penalties on hospitals based on rates of 30-day risk-standardized hospital readmission for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and pneumonia, with up to 3% of a hospital&#8217;s total Medicare revenue from admissions for any condition (target or nontarget) at risk. In fiscal year 2018, 80% of the hospitals subject to the HRRP have been penalized, amounting to $564 million in reduced payments by Medicare.</span>

<p>Adaptations to environmental change are the most important asset for the persistence of any plant or animal species. This is usually achieved through genetic mutation and selection, a slow process driven by chance. Faster and more targeted are epigenetic modifications. A new study carried out by scientists from the Leibniz-IZW in Germany shows for wild guinea pigs that epigenetic modifications specific to individual environmental factors are passed on to the next generation.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Hyperspectral imagery collected from airborne or satellite sources inevitably suffers from spectral variability, making it difficult for spectral unmixing to accurately estimate abundance maps. The classical unmixing model, the linear mixing model (LMM), generally fails to handle this sticky issue effectively. To this end, we propose a novel spectral mixture model, called the augmented LMM, to address spectral variability by applying a data-driven learning strategy in inverse problems of hyperspectral unmixing. The proposed approach models the main spectral variability (i.e., scaling factors) generated by variations in illumination or typography separately by means of the endmember dictionary. It then models other spectral variabilities caused by environmental conditions (e.g., local temperature and humidity and atmospheric effects) and instrumental configurations (e.g., sensor noise), and material nonlinear mixing effects, by introducing a spectral variability dictionary. To effectively run the data-driven learning strategy, we also propose a reasonable prior knowledge for the spectral variability dictionary, whose atoms are assumed to be low-coherent with spectral signatures of endmembers, which leads to a well-known low-coherence dictionary learning problem. Thus, a dictionary learning technique is embedded in the framework of spectral unmixing so that the algorithm can learn the spectral variability dictionary and estimate the abundance maps simultaneously. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets are performed to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with the previous state-of-the-art methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a deep hashing framework, namely, unsupervised deep video hashing (UDVH), for large-scale video similarity search with the aim to learn compact yet effective binary codes. Our UDVH produces the hash codes in a self-taught manner by jointly integrating discriminative video representation with optimal code learning, where an efficient alternating approach is adopted to optimize the objective function. The key differences from most existing video hashing methods lie in: 1) UDVH is an unsupervised hashing method that generates hash codes by cooperatively utilizing feature clustering and a specifically designed binarization with the original neighborhood structure preserved in the binary space and 2) a specific rotation is developed and applied onto video features such that the variance of each dimension can be balanced, thus facilitating the subsequent quantization step. Extensive experiments performed on three popular video datasets show that the UDVH is overwhelmingly better than the state of the arts in terms of various evaluation metrics, which makes it practical in real-world applications.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In conventional wisdom of video modeling, the background is often treated as the primary target and foreground is derived using the technique of background subtraction. Based on the observation that foreground and background are two sides of the same coin, we propose to treat them as peer unknown variables and formulate a joint estimation problem, called Hierarchical modeling and Alternating Optimization (HMAO). The motivation behind our hierarchical extensions of background and foreground models is to better incorporate a priori knowledge about the disparity between background and foreground. For background, we decompose it into temporally low-frequency and high-frequency components for the purpose of better characterizing the class of video with dynamic background; for foreground, we construct a Markov random field prior at a spatially low resolution as the pivot to facilitate the noise-resilient refinement at higher resolutions. Built on hierarchical extensions of both models, we show how to successively refine their joint estimates under a unified framework known as alternating direction multipliers method. Experimental results have shown that our approach produces more discriminative background and demonstrates better robustness to noise than other competing methods. When compared against current state-of-the-art techniques, HMAO achieves at least comparable and often superior performance in terms of F-measure scores, especially for video containing dynamic and complex background.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Frontal view gait recognition for people identification has been carried out using single RGB, stereo RGB, Kinect 1.0, and Doppler radar. However, existing methods based on these camera technologies suffer from several problems. Therefore, we propose a four-part method for frontal view gait recognition based on the fusion of multiple features acquired from a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera. We have developed a gait data set captured by a ToF camera. The data set includes two sessions recorded seven months apart, with 46 and 33 subjects, respectively, each with six walks with five covariates. The four-part method includes: a new human silhouette extraction algorithm that reduces the multiple reflection problem experienced by ToF cameras; a frame selection method based on a new gait cycle detection algorithm; four new gait image representations; and a novel fusion classifier. Rigorous experiments are carried out to compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art methods. The results show distinct improvements over recognition rates for all covariates. The proposed method outperforms all major existing approaches for all covariates and results in 66.1% and 81.0% Rank 1 and Rank 5 recognition rates, respectively, in overall covariates, compared with a best state-of-the-art method performance of 35.7% and 57.7%.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A procedure to calculate maximum torque operating conditions for the inverter-fed induction machine is proposed in this paper. The proposed procedure minimizes the finite-element analysis computation load by identifying the variation range of stator current and slip frequency for the entire torque-speed map. Thus, the total calculation time for machine steady-state performance estimation can be significantly reduced. The effectiveness of the proposed procedure is validated by an experiment.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In the near future, plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) will dominate the car market. The peak-valley difference would increase greatly due to the random nature of PEVs charging behaviors. In this paper, a new problem on studying the dynamic economic/emission dispatch (DEED) including PEVs for peak shaving and valley filling is proposed, and furthermore, the effect caused by different vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) loads on DEED is analyzed. The optimization model of the problem is constructed including several practical constraints, such as power flow constraints and ramp rate limits. The battery degradation cost is also included, which reshapes the objective function of DEED. Based on the model, a strategy for DEED including PEVs for peak shaving and valley filling is given, and a multiobjective optimization algorithm is adopted to solve the proposed problem. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy, three DEED cases are considered under different V2G power. The analysis of the effect on fuel cost and emission caused by different V2G power shows that the proposed strategy can effectively reduce the emission and cut down the investment in peak load plants.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a decoupled power control strategy for a modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based hybrid ac&#x2013;dc grid integrated with a hybrid energy storage system. This system can mitigate the active power fluctuations caused by intermittent renewable generation and also realize reactive power compensation as required by voltage regulation. The proposed hybrid ac&#x2013;dc system has a novel configuration in which batteries and supercapacitors are distributed into the upper arm and the lower arm of the MMC, respectively. Therefore, it is possible to design fully decoupled power control and simultaneously optimize the performances of batteries and supercapacitors. First, the system modeling and operational principles of the MMC are briefly introduced in this paper. On the basis of these analyses, the power decoupling between the upper arm and the lower arm is presented to realize different control objectives. Moreover, battery state-of-charge balancing control and supercapacitor voltage control are also presented, which are crucial for ensuring the normal operation of these energy storage components and the proposed MMC-based hybrid ac&#x2013;dc grid. Finally, the proposed system and its control strategies are verified by laboratory experimental results.

<p>This paper proposes a novel approach for detection of stator short-circuit faults in three-phase induction motors. The method is based on two stages: feature extraction and classification by intelligent systems. First, mutual information is estimated from delayed stator current signals, which are used as inputs of C4.5 decision trees and multilayer perceptron neural networks in the second step. Several offline and online experimental tests are presented considering voltage unbalance, load torque variations, and 1&#x0025; to 10&#x0025; short-circuit levels.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This letter proposes a novel multipulse rectifier. The proposed rectifier is a combination of a novel dual-passive-harmonic-reduction method and a traditional double-star uncontrolled rectifier. The proposed method contains a multiwinding interphase reactor (IPR) and the corresponding auxiliary circuit. From the viewpoint of minimizing the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the input line current, the turn ratio of the multiwinding IPR is optimally designed. Under the optimal turn ratio, the proposed rectifier operates as an 18-pulse rectifier. Its theoretical THD of the input line current is about 10.1&#x0025;, and its experimental THD is 6.58&#x0025;. The proposed method is simple and easy to realize.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Lung cancer is the type of cancer that most often kills after the initial diagnosis. To aid the specialist in its diagnosis, temporal evaluation is a potential tool for analyzing indeterminate lesions, which may be benign or malignant, during treatment. With this goal in mind, a methodology is herein proposed for the analysis, quantification, and visualization of changes in lung lesions. This methodology uses a modified version of the quality threshold clustering algorithm to associate each voxel of the lesion to a cluster, and changes in the lesion over time are defined in terms of voxel moves to another cluster. In addition, statistical features are extracted for classification of the lesion as benign or malignant. To develop the proposed methodology, two databases of pulmonary lesions were used, one for malignant lesions in treatment (public) and the other for indeterminate cases (private). We determined that the density change percentage varied from 6.22&#x0025; to 36.93&#x0025; of lesion volume in the public database of malignant lesions under treatment and from 19.98&#x0025; to 38.81&#x0025; in the private database of lung nodules. Additionally, other inter-cluster density change measures were obtained. These measures indicate the degree of change in the clusters and how each of them is abundant in relation to volume. From the statistical analysis of regions in which the density changes occurred, we were able to discriminate lung lesions with an accuracy of 98.41&#x0025;, demonstrating that these changes can indicate the true nature of the lesion. In addition to visualizing the density changes occurring in lesions over time, we quantified these changes and analyzed the entire set through volumetry, which is the technique most commonly used to analyze changes in pulmonary lesions.

<p>Metaheuristic techniques have shown remarkable performance in a vast variety of engineering problems. Accurate solving of nonlinear equation set in selective harmonic elimination (SHE) has been one of the widely discussed numerical problems in power electronics. Current study aims at conducting an inclusive comparison of prominent stochastic methods adopted for SHE and modified SHE (MSHE) pulse width modulation techniques. The problem is defined as finding local optima of cascaded H-bride converter operation parameters. The survey investigates key indices of low-order harmonic components and weighted total harmonic distortion. Floating fundamental component is introduced for SHE and MSHE to achieve higher rate of flexibility for optimization techniques. Finally, an advanced modulation technique is proposed to address the dc-link voltage ripples. Simulation and experimental results are presented as a proof of concept.

<p>This paper investigates the peak-to-peak filtering problem for a class of networked nonlinear dc motor systems with quantization. The nonlinear dc motor system is modeled by a Takagi&#x2013;Sugeno (T&#x2013;S) fuzzy model. Consider that the measurement output signal and the performance output signal of the system are quantized by two static quantizers before being transmitted by the digital communication channel, respectively. Attention is focused on the design of a peak-to-peak filter such that the filtering error system is asymptotically stable and satisfies the prescribed peak-to-peak filtering performance index. Sufficient conditions for such a peak-to-peak filter are expressed in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, an illustrative simulation is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Effectively monitoring maritime environments has become a vital problem in maritime applications. Traditional methods are not only expensive and time consuming but also restricted in both time and space. More recently, the concept of an industrial wireless sensor network (IWSN) has become a promising alternative for monitoring next-generation intelligent maritime grids, because IWSNs are cost-effective and easy to deploy. This paper focuses on solving the issue of 3-D IWSN deployment in a 3-D engine room space of a very large crude-oil carrier and also considers numerous power facilities. To address this 3-D IWSN deployment problem for maritime applications, a 3-D uncertain coverage model is proposed that uses a modified 3-D sensing model and an uncertain fusion operator. The deployment problem is converted into a multiobjective optimization problem that simultaneously addresses three objectives: coverage, lifetime, and reliability. Our goal is to achieve extensive coverage, long network lifetime, and high reliability. We also propose a distributed parallel cooperative coevolutionary multiobjective large-scale evolutionary algorithm for maritime applications. We verify the effectiveness of this algorithm through experiments by comparing it with five state-of-the-art algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method performs most effectively both in optimization performance and in minimizing the computation time.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is used for the first time to detect fabricated defects in a glass fiber-skinned lightweight honeycomb composite panel. A novel amplitude polynomial regression (APR) algorithm is proposed as a preprocessing method. This method segments the amplitude&#x2013;frequency curves to simulate the heating and the cooling monotonic behavior as in infrared thermography. Then, the method of empirical orthogonal function (EOF) imaging is applied on the APR preprocessed data as a postprocessing algorithm. Signal-to-noise ratio analysis is performed to verify the image improvement of the proposed APR-EOF modality from a quantitative point of view. Finally, the experimental results and the physical analysis show that THz is more suitable with respect to the detection of defects in glass fiber lightweight honeycomb composites.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Depth information is being widely used in many real-world applications. However, due to the limitation of depth sensing technology, the captured depth map in practice usually has much lower resolution than that of color image counterpart. In this paper, we propose to combine the internal smoothness prior and external gradient consistency constraint in graph domain for depth super-resolution. On one hand, a new graph Laplacian regularizer is proposed to preserve the inherent piecewise smooth characteristic of depth, which has desirable filtering properties. A specific weight matrix of the respect graph is defined to make full use of information of both depth and the corresponding guidance image. On the other hand, inspired by an observation that the gradient of depth is small except at edge separating regions, we introduce a graph gradient consistency constraint to enforce that the graph gradient of depth is close to the thresholded gradient of guidance. We reinterpret the gradient thresholding model as variational optimization with sparsity constraint. In this way, we remedy the problem of structure discrepancy between depth and guidance. Finally, the internal and external regularizations are casted into a unified optimization framework, which can be efficiently addressed by ADMM. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art with respect to both objective and subjective quality evaluations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Garbled circuits are general tools that allow two parties to compute any function without disclosing their respective inputs. Applications of this technique vary from distributed privacy-preserving machine learning tasks to secure outsourced authentication. Unfortunately, the energy cost of garbled circuit evaluation protocols is substantial. This limits the applicability of garbled circuits in scenarios that involve battery-operated devices, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and smartphones. In this paper, we propose MEG, a Memory- and Energy-efficient Garbled circuit evaluation mechanism. MEG utilizes batch data transmission and multi-threading to reduce memory and energy consumption. We implement MEG on an Android smartphone and compare its performance and energy consumption with state-of-the-art techniques using two garbled circuits of widely different sizes (AES-128 and 256-bit edit distance). Our results show that, compared with &#x201c;plain&#x201d; garbled circuit evaluation, MEG decreases memory consumption by more than 90%. When compared with current pipelined garbled circuit evaluation techniques, MEG's energy usage was 42% lower for AES-128 and 23% lower for EDT-256. Furthermore, our multi-thread implementation of MEG decreased circuit evaluation time by up to 56.7% for AES-128, and by up to 13.5% for EDT-256, compared with state-of-the-art pipelining techniques.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to its cost efficiency, the controller area network (CAN) is still the most wide-spread in-vehicle bus, and the numerous reported attacks demonstrate the urgency in designing new security solutions for CAN. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection mechanism that takes advantage of Bloom filtering to test frame periodicity based on message identifiers and parts of the data-field which facilitates detection of potential replay or modification attacks. This proves to be an effective approach since most of the traffic from in-vehicle buses is cyclic in nature and the format of the data-field is fixed due to rigid signal allocation. Bloom filters provide an efficient time-memory tradeoff which is beneficial for the constrained resources of automotive grade controllers. We test the correctness of our approach and obtain good results on an industry-standard CANoe-based simulation for a J1939 commercial-vehicle bus and also on CAN with flexible data-rate traces obtained from a real-world high-end vehicle. The proposed filtering mechanism is straightforward to adapt for any other time-triggered in-vehicle bus, e.g., FlexRay, since it is built on time-driven characteristics.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Three-dimensional mask spoofing attacks have been one of the main challenges in face recognition. Compared with a 3D mask, a real face displays different facial motion patterns that are reflected by different facial dynamic textures. However, a large portion of these facial motion differences is subtle. We find that the subtle facial motion can be fully captured by multiple deep dynamic textures from a convolutional layer of a convolutional neural network, but not all deep dynamic textures from different spatial regions and different channels of a convolutional layer are useful for differentiation of subtle motions between real faces and 3D masks. In this paper, we propose a novel feature learning model to learn discriminative deep dynamic textures for 3D mask face anti-spoofing. A novel joint discriminative learning strategy is further incorporated in the learning model to jointly learn the spatial- and channel-discriminability of the deep dynamic textures. The proposed joint discriminative learning strategy can be used to adaptively weight the discriminability of the learned feature from different spatial regions or channels, which ensures that more discriminative deep dynamic textures play more important roles in face/mask classification. Experiments on several publicly available data sets validate that the proposed method achieves promising results in intra- and cross-data set scenarios.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we consider user scheduling and power allocation techniques for downlinks where transmitted message must be kept confidential from all other unintended users and the number of users is larger than that of access point (AP) antennas. In order to maximize network secrecy rate with a limited number of antennas, the AP schedules a user who can achieve the largest secrecy rate and exploits multiple antennas for transmitting artificial noise to the unintended users. We derive the closed-form expressions of the optimal power allocation for the artificial noise and the average network secrecy rate through asymptotic analysis. The analysis results provide the insightful information on the behaviors of the user scheduling and the effect of system parameters on the network secrecy rate performance. It is shown that opportunistic scheduling with artificial noise transmission technique is more effective than the conventional precoding techniques for multiple confidential message transmissions in terms of network secrecy rate. Furthermore, we have also discussed a transmission strategy for the worst case scenarios where all unintended users are treated as colluding eavesdroppers. The simulations confirm the validity of the analysis results and provide additional information on the network performance in general cases.
