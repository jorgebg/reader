<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Periocular recognition has been emerging as an effective biometric identification approach, especially under less constrained environments where face and/or iris recognition is not applicable. This paper proposes a new deep learning-based architecture for robust and more accurate periocular recognition which incorporates attention model to emphasize important regions in the periocular images. The new architecture adopts multi-glance mechanism, in which part of the intermediate components are configured to incorporate emphasis on important semantical regions, i.e., eyebrow and eye, within a periocular image. By focusing on these regions, the deep convolutional neural network is able to learn additional discriminative features, which in turn improves the recognition capability of the whole model. The superior performance of our method strongly suggests that eyebrow and eye regions are important for periocular recognition, and deserve special attention during the deep feature learning process. This paper also presents a customized verification-oriented loss function, which is shown to provide higher discriminating power than conventional contrastive/triplet loss functions. Extensive experiments on six publicly available databases are performed to evaluate the proposed approach. The reproducible experimental results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods for the periocular recognition.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper investigates the incremental-redundancy hybrid-automatic repeat request (IR-HARQ) transmission over independent block-fading channels in the presence of an eavesdropper, where the secrecy of the transmission is ensured via introduction of dummy messages. Since the encoder only knows the statistics of the channel state, the secrecy and the reliability are defined in a probabilistic framework. Unlike previous works on this subject, we design a coding strategy tailored to IR-HARQ by splitting the dummy-message rate over several rate parameters. These additional degrees of freedom improve the match between the dummy-message rates and the realizations of the eavesdropper channels. We evaluate the performance in terms of secrecy outage probability, connection outage probability, and throughput and compare it with the benchmark paper by Tang et al. Numerical examples illustrate that, comparing to existing alternatives, splitting of the dummy-message rate provides higher throughput and lower expected duration/average delay.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Incentive mechanism plays a critical role in privacy-aware crowdsensing. Most previous studies assume a trustworthy fusion center (FC) in their co-design of incentive mechanism and privacy preservation. Very recent work has taken the step to relax the assumption on trustworthy FC and allowed participatory users (PUs) to randomly report their binary sensing data, whereas the focus is to examine PUs&#x2019; equilibrium behavior. Making a paradigm shift, this paper aims to study the privacy compensation for continuous data sensing while allowing FC to directly control PUs. There are two conflicting objectives in such a scenario: FC desires better quality data in order to achieve higher aggregation accuracy whereas PUs prefer injecting larger noises for higher privacy-preserving levels (PPLs). To strike a good balance therein, we propose an efficient incentive mechanism named REAP to reconcile FC&#x2019;s aggregation accuracy and individual PU&#x2019;s data privacy. Specifically, we adopt the celebrated notion of differential privacy to quantify PUs&#x2019; PPLs and characterize their impacts on FC&#x2019;s aggregation accuracy. Then, appealing to contract theory, we design an incentive mechanism to maximize FC&#x2019;s aggregation accuracy under a given budget. The proposed incentive mechanism offers different contracts to PUs with different privacy preferences, by which FC can directly control them. It can further overcome the information asymmetry problem, i.e., FC typically does not know each PU&#x2019;s precise privacy preference. We derive closed-form solutions for the optimal contracts in both complete information and incomplete information scenarios. Further, the results are generalized to the continuous case where PUs&#x2019; privacy preferences take values in a continuous domain. Extensive simulations are provided -
o validate the feasibility and advantages of our proposed incentive mechanism.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The proliferation of online biometric authentication has necessitated security requirements of biometric templates. The existing secure biometric authentication schemes feature a server-centric model, where a service provider maintains a biometric database and is fully responsible for the security of the templates. The end-users have to fully trust the server in storing, processing, and managing their private templates. As a result, the end-users&#x2019; templates could be compromised by outside attackers or even the service provider itself. In this paper, we propose a user-centric biometric authentication scheme (PassBio) that enables end-users to encrypt their own templates with our proposed light-weighted encryption scheme. During authentication, all the templates remain encrypted such that the server will never see them directly. However, the server is able to determine whether the distance of two encrypted templates is within a pre-defined threshold. Our security analysis shows that no critical information of the templates can be revealed under both passive and active attacks. PassBio follows a &#x201c;compute-then-compare&#x201d; computational model over encrypted data. More specifically, our proposed threshold predicate encryption (TPE) scheme can encrypt two vectors x and y in such a manner that the inner product of x and y can be evaluated and compared to a pre-defined threshold. TPE guarantees that only the comparison result is revealed and no key information about x and y can be learned. Furthermore, we show that TPE can be utilized as a flexible building block to evaluate different distance metrics, such as Hamming distance and Euclidean distance over encrypted data. Such a compute-then-compare computational model, enabled by TPE, can be widely applied in many interesting applications, such as searching over encrypted data while ensuring data security and privacy.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recently, there has been great interest in feature-based image source identification. Previous statistical learning-based methods usually regarded the identification process as a classification problem. They assumed the dependence of features and the dependence of models. However, the two assumptions are usually problematic because of the genuine coupling of features and models. To address the issues, in this paper, we propose a novel image source identification scheme. For the feature coupling, a coupled feature representation is adopted to analyze the coupled interaction among features. The coupling relations among features and their powers are measured with Pearson&#x2019;s correlations and integrated in a Taylor-like expansion manner. Regarding model coupling, a new coupled probability representation is developed. The model coupling relationships are characterized with conditional probabilities induced by the confusion matrix and then combined with the law of total probability. The experiments carried out on the Dresden image collection confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Via mining the feature coupling and model coupling, the identification accuracy can be significantly improved.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper addresses the estimation of the grid impedance and the control of grid-tied converters by combining pulsed signal injection (PSI) and observer-based techniques. A Luenberger-based observer is used for controlling the grid-side current of an LCL filter by only measuring the converter-side currents and the grid-side voltage. This configuration mitigates the effects of parameter variation at the LCL filter. Under grid impedance changes, the observer control signal will be used for triggering the signal injection. A PSI approach is employed for estimating online the grid impedance using a recursive least square algorithm. Compared with existing grid-impedance estimation techniques, the proposed method can: 1) identify a generic RL grid impedance, even under unbalanced conditions; 2) reduce the distortion induced by the excitation signal by relying on the observer to triggering the injection when a grid impedance change is detected; and 3) identify grid impedance values much lower than the converter filter impedance, which is the usual situation when the converter rated power is well below the grid rating. Finally, it is worth pointing out that the proposed estimation technique is well-suited to be incorporated into an adaptive current controller scheme.

<p>A microwave duplexer with high isolation is presented in this paper. The device is based on triple-mode filters that are built using silver-plated ceramic cuboids. To create a six-pole, six-transmission-zero filter in the DCS-1800 band, which is utilized in mobile communications, two cuboids are cascaded. To shift spurious harmonics, low dielectric caps are placed on the cuboid faces. These caps push the first cuboid spurious up in frequency by around 340 MHz compared to the uncapped cuboid, allowing a 700-MHz spurious free window. To verify the design, a DCS-1800 duplexer with 75-MHz widebands is built. It achieves around 1 dB of insertion loss for both the receive and transmit ports with around 70 dB of mutual isolation within only 20-MHz band separation, using a volume of only 30 cm<sup>3 </sup>.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel nonisolated single-input dual-output three-level dc&#x2013;dc converter (SIDO-TLC) appropriate for medium- and high-voltage applications. The SIDO-TLC is an integration of the three-level buck and boost converters, whose output voltages are regulated simultaneously. Reducing voltage stress across semiconductor devices, improving efficiency, and reducing inductors size are among the main merits of the new topology. Moreover, due to the considerably reduced volume of the step-down filter capacitor, a small film capacitor can be used instead, whose advantages are lower equivalent series resistance and a longer lifespan. A closed-loop control system has been designed based on a small-signal model derivation in order to regulate the output voltages along with the capacitors&#x2019; voltage balancing. In order to verify the theoretical and simulation results, a 300-W prototype was built and experimented. The results prove the aforementioned advantages of the SIDO-TLC, and the high effectiveness of the balancing control strategy. Furthermore, the converter shows very good stability, even under simultaneous step changes of the loads and input voltage.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>An adaptive self-organizing map (SOM) neural network method is proposed for distributed formation control of a group of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). This method controls the AUVs holding their positions in the formation when the formation moves as a whole. The group of AUVs can reach the desired locations in an expected formation shape along preplanned trajectories. The proposed control law is distributed in the sense that the controller of each AUV only uses its own information and limited information of its neighboring AUVs. Formation-control strategies based on self-organizing competitive calculations are carried out with workload balance taken into consideration, so that a group of AUVs can reach the desired locations on the premise of workload balance and energy sufficiency. Moreover, the formation can avoid obstacles and change its shape as needed. The formation is in a distributed leader&#x2013;follower-like structure, but there is no need to designate the leader and the followers explicitly. All the AUVs in the formation are treated equal to be the leader and the followers, so that important characteristics such as adaption and fault tolerance are achieved. Comparison results with traditional methods and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes an equivalent rule of source placement in different positions of the impedance source network. By applying the rule, allowable positions for placing source are discovered in the Z source network, capacitor assisted quasi Z source network, and other impedance source networks. The rule is feasible to find out all the possible subnetworks from its parent-network methodically by just changing the positions of the voltage source. Performance differences of the corresponding subnetworks caused by the different positions of voltage source are also discussed. Finally, simulations and experiments are implemented with dc load to validate the rule of source placement.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>One of the key challenges in modern manufacturing systems is how to dynamically reconfigure software behaviors that govern machines to reflect changes in physical manufacturing process without completely resetting the entire manufacturing operation. The existing software solutions used to describe software behaviors in manufacturing systems are typically not based on formal semantics and model of computation and have limited capabilities in handling dynamic adaptation/reconfiguration. This paper presents the Service-Oriented SystemJ (SOSJ) framework that supports a new programming paradigm for designing dynamic distributed manufacturing systems. SOSJ combines the system-level language SystemJ and service-oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm to take advantages of both SystemJ&#x0027;s correct-by-construction formal semantics and SOA&#x0027;s dynamic features, respectively. The paper describes the concepts and functionalities of SOSJ, which enable dynamic reconfiguration of a typical manufacturing system. Performance benchmarks are run to compare the capabilities of SOSJ to a multiagent system framework JADE.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC) strategy for a grid-tied cascaded full-bridge inverter with neutral-point-clamped legs has been developed. Two strings of photovoltaic (PV) cells are interfaced to the grid by the inverter, while the controller ensures the operation at maximum power conditions. It is thus essential for the developed control method to be capable of independently regulating the two dc sources while balancing the dc-link voltages of the capacitors. In addition to these requirements, the proposed controller addresses the critical issue of the common-mode voltage (CMV) effects. By using the redundant switching states of the inverter topology, MPC reduces the high-frequency CMV components and consequently, the flow of the leakage currents from the PV system to earth ground. The developed control strategy is tested by conducting various experiments in an inverter prototype connected to two PV strings. Additionally, the system performance at steady-state conditions, during abrupt reference changes, and with grid voltage variations is compared with the traditional control strategy.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To save energy during content delivery in green cities, caching contents on edge nodes that are placed near mobile social users has been advocated recently. However, how to allocate the limited caching resources with secure content delivery becomes a new challenge. Therefore, in this paper, we present a novel theoretical model to deliver secure content with edge nodes in order to save energy for green cities. First, we present a reverse auction game to encourage edge nodes to cooperatively provide caching services with incentives. With the model, mobile users can determine the candidate of edge node to cache content based on the interaction between mobile users and edge nodes. Second, a trust management method is designed to evaluate the reliability of the selected candidate of edge node by considering the direct trust evaluation. Finally, extensive simulations show that the proposal can save energy with a secure content delivery where both the delay to obtain the content and the caching ratio can be improved compared with the conventional methods.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To apply cyber-physical system (CPS) technique in industrial internet, a wireless technology that is able to robustly maintain hyperconnectivity between a data center and distributed user entities and/or industrial Internet of Things devices is required. We investigate the feasibility of utilizing massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) as such a wireless technology. We analyze the performance of a massive MIMO base station deployed at a data center to provide massive connectivity to a large number of devices. In addition, we discuss related research challenges for deploying massive MIMO in industrial internet applications of CPS, such as device scheduling and power control, energy efficient design and radio frequency energy transfer/harvesting, signaling techniques for drones and mobile robots, and applications of underwater industrial internet.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>An operating procedure (OP), also known as checklist or action plan, is a list of actions or criteria arranged in a systematic way, commonly used in areas such as aviation or healthcare to ensure the success of critical tasks and to help decrease human errors. In these areas, operators are hardly trained to follow the OP carefully, but the evaluation of how they are following, it is usually performed manually by an expert instructor. Automating this evaluation process would lead to an objective and scalable analysis of the operator performance, which is extremely important in areas where the number of operators to evaluate is high. This problem, which can be referred as automatic procedure following evaluation, needs of new techniques and formalizations due to current conformance checking methods do not fit well with some aspects of a OP. In this paper, OPs are modeled as Petri Net-based workflows, and interact with the data log of the system to allow an automatic evaluation of the progress and time spent following the OP. In order to illustrate the contributions of this paper, a case study is carried out designing and modeling an emergency OP for an unmanned aircraft system, and evaluating the proposed approach with a battery of tests.

<p><span class="paragraphSection"><strong>In Reply</strong> Dr Okada and colleagues and Dr Haviari are concerned about residual confounding. Our objective was to define a time-to-surgery threshold after hip fracture indicative of increased risk, if one existed. We found that the adjusted risk of developing complications increased when the wait time was greater than 24 hours, irrespective of the complication or follow-up period considered when time was analyzed as a continuous variable. Comparing propensity score&#8211;matched groups, assessing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and performing several sensitivity analyses added to the robustness of this definition. We caution against assuming that the observational study is confounded for these reasons.</span>
