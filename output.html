<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Existing charging techniques for lithium-ion batteries use a largely open-loop approach, where the charge profile is predecided based on a priori knowledge of cell parameters. There is a need for closed-loop charging techniques that use instantaneous cell voltage and/or temperature to modulate the charging current magnitude. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a constant-temperature constant-voltage (CT-CV) charging technique, considering cell temperature as a key degradation metric. The proposed CT-CV charging scheme employs a simple and easy-to-implement proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller aided by a feed-forward term. The charging current is dynamically adjusted in response to the battery temperature, which indirectly reflects its aging and thermal environment. As per experimental results, the proposed method achieves 20% faster charging with the same total temperature rise as constant-current constant-voltage (CC-CV) technique. Alternatively, it causes 20% lower cell temperature rise for given total charge time. It can easily accommodate applications that demand even faster charging by simply raising the set temperature. This paper establishes the benefits of the proposed CT-CV charging at cell level and raises the possibility of extending it to the pack level by integrating it with battery management systems.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Laser direct joining of metal and plastic plays a significant role in manufacturing of multiple material structures. To improve the strength of the joint, a controllable laser joining system was developed for polyethylene terephthalate plastic and titanium based on the detected multiple signal sources. The main contribution of this paper lies in sensing 1) the intensity of thermal radiation to control process heat by adjusting the laser power; and 2) the reflection of the helium-neon laser to control the movement of the specimens. The response speeds of thermal radiation intensity when increasing or decreasing the laser powers were measured to guide the adjustment of laser power. The intensities of reflective light before and after the joining process were measured to guide the movement control. Then, the integrated control process was set up. Width, tensile shear strength, and fracture position of the joint produced by the controllable joining system were compared with those produced by the conventional constant power method, which validated the advantage of this newly developed system.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a new design method for digital bandpass and bandstop infinite impulse response filters with nearly linear-phase response is proposed. In this method, the phase response of an all-pass filter is optimized in the frequency domain to yield less passband error Err and stopband error Er<sub>9</sub> with optimal stopband attenuation A<sub>9</sub>. To achieve high accuracy in passband and stopband regions, fractional derivative (FD) constraints are evaluated in the respective regions, and the filter coefficients are computed using the Lagrange multiplier method. The behavior of fidelity parameters measured in terms of E<sub>rr</sub>, Er<sub>9</sub>, and phase error Er<sub>ph</sub> is multimodel w.r.t. FD values. Therefore, modern heuristic technique, known as cuckoo search optimization is used for determining the optimal value of FDs and reference frequency simultaneously to minimize the fitness function, which is constructed as a sum of the squared error in passband and stopband. The designed filter yields up to 60% reduction in Err and Erph in the case of bandpass filter. Meanwhile, the response of filter is not degraded due to the finite word length effect.

<p>In the wake of the recent west African Ebola epidemic, there is global consensus on the need for strong health systems; however, agreement is less apparent on effective mechanisms for establishing and maintaining these systems, particularly in resource-constrained settings and in the presence of multiple and sustained stresses (eg, conflict, famine, climate change, and globalisation). The construction of the International Health Regulations (2005) guidelines and the WHO health systems framework, has resulted in the separation of public health functions and health-care services, which are interdependent in actuality and must be integrated to ensure a continuous, unbroken national health system.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Human activity recognition is a core problem in intelligent automation systems due to its far-reaching applications including ubiquitous computing, health-care services, and smart living. Due to the nonintrusive property of smartphones, smartphone sensors are widely used for the identification of human activities. However, unlike applications in vision or data mining domain, feature embedding from deep neural networks performs much worse in terms of recognition accuracy than properly designed handcrafted features. In this paper, we posit that feature embedding from deep neural networks may convey complementary information and propose a novel knowledge distilling strategy to improve its performance. More specifically, an efficient shallow network, i.e., single-layer feedforward neural network (SLFN), with handcrafted features is utilized to assist a deep long short-term memory (LSTM) network. On the one hand, the deep LSTM network is able to learn features from raw sensory data to encode temporal dependencies. On the other hand, the deep LSTM network can also learn from SLFN to mimic how it generalizes. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of recognition accuracy against several state-of-the-art methods in the literature.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fog computing provides a more flexible service environment than cloud computing. The lightweight fog environment is suitable for industrial applications. In order to strengthen service scalability, container virtualization has been proposed and studied in recent years. It is vital to explore the tradeoff between service scalability and operating expenses. This paper integrates the hypervisor technique with container virtualization, and constructs an integrated virtualization (IV) fog platform for deploying industrial applications based on the virtual network function. This paper presents a fuzzy-based real-time autoscaling (FRAS) mechanism and implements it in the IV fog platform. The FRAS mechanism provides a dynamic, rapid, lightweight, and low-cost solution to the service autoscaling problem. Experimental results showed that the proposed FRAS mechanism yields a better service scale with lower average delay, error rate, and operating expenses compared to other autoscaling schemes.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the joint optimal resource allocation and probabilistic caching design for device-to-device (D2D) communications in a wireless heterogeneous network with full-duplex (FD) relays. In particular, popular contents can be cached at user devices as well as at relays that are located close to users. A user can request contents from another user via D2D communications and also from a nearby relay equipped with FD radios. In the case that there is a caching miss (i.e., the requested contents are not found at the other users/relays within the coverage range), users can connect to the base station via a relay by using the FD communication technology. Subsequently, we develop mathematical models to analyze the throughput performance with edge caching where both cochannel system level interference and FD self-interference are considered. Due to the high complexity of stochastic optimization, we develop low-complexity optimization formulation by decomposing the original problem into three simple subproblems that can be efficiently solved. Finally, numerical results are presented to illustrate developed theoretical findings in the paper and significant performance gains of the throughput performance.

<p>Mobile-edge computing (MEC) has aroused significant attention for its performance to accelerate application&#x0027;s operation and enrich user&#x0027;s experience. With the increasing development of green computing, energy harvesting (EH) is considered as an available technology to capture energy from circumambient environment to supply extra energy for mobile devices. In this paper, we propose an online dynamic tasks assignment scheduling to investigate the tradeoff between energy consumption and execution delay for an MEC system with EH capability. We formulate it into an average weighted sum of energy consumption and execution delay minimization problem of mobile device with the stability of buffer queues and battery level as constraints. Based on the Lyapunov optimization method, we obtain the optimal scheduling about the CPU-cycle frequencies of mobile device and transmit power for data transmission. Besides, the dynamic online tasks offloading strategy is developed to modify the data backlogs of queues. The performance analysis shows the stability of the battery energy level and the tradeoff between energy consumption and execution delay. Moreover, the MEC system with EH devices and task buffers implements the high energy efficient and low latency communications. The performance of the proposed online algorithm is validated with extensive trace-driven simulations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the rapid development of Internet of things devices and network infrastructure, there have been a lot of sensors adopted in the industrial productions, resulting in a large size of data. One of the most popular examples is the manufacture inspection, which is to detect the defects of the products. In order to implement a robust inspection system with higher accuracy, we propose a deep learning based classification model in this paper, which can find the possible defective products. As there may be many assembly lines in one factory, one huge problem in this scenario is how to process such big data in real time. Therefore, we design our system with the concept of fog computing. By offloading the computation burden from the central server to the fog nodes, the system obtains the ability to deal with extremely large data. There are two obvious advantages in our system. The first one is that we adapt the convolutional neural network model to the fog computing environment, which significantly improves its computing efficiency. The other one is that we work out an inspection model, which can simultaneously indicate the defect type and its degree. The experiments well prove that the proposed method is robust and efficient.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The cancelable biometric-based template protection method proposed in this paper addresses security and privacy concerns emerging from the phenomenal usage of biometric systems. Cancelable biometric transforms the original biometric identity of a user to a pseudo-biometric identity that is used for storage and matching purposes. The use of pseudo-identity mitigates privacy risks and allows revocability in case of compromise. This paper proposes a novel template transformation technique named random distance method which not only generates discriminative and privacy preserving revocable pseudo-biometric identities, but also reduces their size by 50%. Extensive experimentation is performed to analyze recognition and protection performance on unimodal and multimodal pseudo-identities generated with various biometric modalities such as face, thermal face, palmprint, palmvein, and fingervein. It is observed that the matching performance obtained with the proposed cancelable templates in the worst-case is closer to the performance achieved in the original domain. Also, multimodal cancelable biometric templates generated with the proposed method are observed for improved performance. Furthermore, the proposed approach is successfully analyzed for non-invertibilty, unlinkability, as well as its resistance for various types of attacks like attacks via record multiplicity, dictionary, false accepts, and brute force.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In 2015, NIST held a workshop calling for new candidates for the next generation of elliptic curves to replace the almost two-decade old NIST curves. Nothing Upon My Sleeves (NUMS) curves are among the potential candidates presented in the workshop. Here, we present the first implementation of the NUMS256, NUMS379, and NUMS384 curves on two types of embedded devices. The implementations, which exhibit regular, constant-time execution to protect against timing and simple side-channel attacks, set new speed records and advance the state-of-the-art of curve-based (without endomorphism) scalar multiplication on 8-bit AVR and 32-bit ARM11 microcontrollers. For example, our NUMS256 implementation computes a scalar multiplication in ~1.4 million cycles on a low-power 32-bit ARM11 microcontroller using mixed C and assembly language. These results demonstrate the potential of deploying IoT-NUMS on constrained and low-power applications such as protocols for the Internet of Things.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>During a pollution attack, malicious nodes purposely transmit bogus data to the honest nodes to cripple the communication. Securing the communication requires identifying and isolating the malicious nodes. However, in network coding (NC) architectures, random recombinations at the nodes increase the probability that honest nodes relay polluted packets. Thus, discriminating between honest and malicious nodes to isolate the latter turns out to be challenging at best. Band codes (BCs) are a family of rateless codes whose coding window size can be adjusted to reduce the probability that honest nodes relay polluted packets. We leverage such a property to design a distributed scheme for identifying the malicious nodes in the network. Each node counts the number of times that each neighbor has been involved in cases of polluted data reception and exchanges such counts with its neighbor nodes. Then, each node computes for each neighbor a discriminative honest score estimating the probability that the neighbor relays clean packets. We model such probability as a function of the BC coding window size, showing its impact on the accuracy and effectiveness of our distributed blacklisting scheme. We experiment distributing a live video feed in a P2P NC system, verifying the accuracy of our model and showing that our scheme allows us to secure the network against pollution attacks recovering near pre-attack video quality.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, an enhanced mixed droop control strategy is proposed for a fuel cell/supercapacitor-based auxiliary power unit (FC/SC-APU), which is usually used in large electric vehicles, to achieve the dynamic load power allocation in a decentralized way. By applying an adjustable virtual impedance droop scheme to the SC converter and a virtual resistor droop scheme to the FC converter, the SC is able to buffer the fast-changing or pulsating load power flow, leaving the FC only providing the average load power. Since this method is fully decentralized, it features high flexibility and scalability. Furthermore, the proposed strategy is very suitable for extending the system&#x0027;s service life because the recovery and operational limit of the state-of-charge of SC have been considered in the power allocation. The operational principle of the proposed control strategy and the system design are elaborated, followed by which real-time simulations are conducted to verify theoretical analyses.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The nine-phase six-terminal induction machine (IM) has been recently proposed as a promising contender to the conventional asymmetrical six-phase type in terms of torque density, stator winding simplicity, and fault-tolerant capability. The stator is composed of nine phases, which are connected in a fashion to only provide six stator terminals. Therefore, this connection combines the high performance of a nine-phase winding with the terminal behavior of a six-phase machine. This paper introduces the machine mathematical model based on the vector space decomposition (VSD) modeling approach. The required current and voltage sequence transformation matrices are derived such that the machine is mathematically regarded as an equivalent six-phase IM with only three decoupled subspaces. This way, the same VSD-based controller structures conventionally applied to six-phase-based systems can be preserved. A 1.5-hp prototype IM is used to experimentally validate the machine model under both healthy and open-phase conditions.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In video surveillance, face recognition (FR) systems are employed to detect individuals of interest appearing over a distributed network of cameras. The performance of still-to-video FR systems can decline significantly because faces captured in unconstrained operational domain (OD) over multiple video cameras have a different underlying data distribution compared to faces captured under controlled conditions in the enrollment domain with a still camera. This is particularly true when individuals are enrolled to the system using a single reference still. To improve the robustness of these systems, it is possible to augment the reference set by generating synthetic faces based on the original still. However, without the knowledge of the OD, many synthetic images must be generated to account for all possible capture conditions. FR systems may, therefore, require complex implementations and yield lower accuracy when training on many less relevant images. This paper introduces an algorithm for domain-specific face synthesis (DSFS) that exploits the representative intra-class variation information available from the OD. Prior to operation (during camera calibration), a compact set of faces from unknown persons appearing in the OD is selected through affinity propagation clustering in the captured condition space (defined by pose and illumination estimation). The domain-specific variations of these face images are then projected onto the reference still of each individual by integrating an image-based face relighting technique inside the 3-D reconstruction framework. A compact set of synthetic faces is generated that resemble individuals of interest under the capture conditions relevant to the OD. In a particular implementation based on sparse representation classification, the synthetic faces generated with the DSFS are employed to form a cross-domain dictionary that accounts for structured sparsity, where the dictionary blocks combine the original and synthetic faces o-
 each individual. Experimental results obtained with videos from the Chokepoint and COX-S2V data sets reveal that augmenting the reference gallery set of still-to-video FR systems using the proposed DSFS approach can provide a significantly higher level of accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, with only a moderate increase in its computational complexity.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Privacy preservation is addressed for decentralized optimization, where $N$ agents cooperatively minimize the sum of $N$ convex functions private to these individual agents. In most existing decentralized optimization approaches, participating agents exchange and disclose states explicitly, which may not be desirable when the states contain sensitive information of individual agents. The problem is more acute when adversaries exist which try to steal information from other participating agents. To address this issue, we propose a privacy-preserving decentralized optimization approach based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and partially homomorphic cryptography. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that cryptographic techniques are incorporated in a fully decentralized setting to enable privacy preservation in decentralized optimization in the absence of any third party or aggregator. To facilitate the incorporation of encryption in a fully decentralized manner, we introduce a new ADMM, which allows time-varying penalty matrices and rigorously prove that it has a convergence rate of $O(1/t)$ . Numerical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness and low-computational complexity of the proposed approach.
