<p><span class="paragraphSection"><strong>To the Editor</strong> The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently recommended screening for cervical cancer every 3 years with cervical cytology in women aged 21 to 29 years (A recommendation). I question why cervical screening is recommended starting at age 21 years rather than 25 years. For unscreened women younger than 25 years, the incidence of invasive cervical cancer is extremely low. Many other countries with evidence-based national policies start screening at age 25 years or even 30 years. The task force did not appear to consider the question of starting age.</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Some 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, scholars are still investigating the impacts of the transition years&#8212;from the finding that east Europeans born around the introduction of free markets are, on average, a centimetre shorter than people born just before or immediately after the onset of transition to the association between mass privatisation programmes in post-socialist European countries and a short-term increase in mortality rates among working-aged men. But what about the women? Although women from former Eastern Bloc countries were relatively better prepared than men for the transition to the free market, partly due to their education and professional experience in certain &#8220;white collar&#8221; sectors of the economy, rapid privatisation and the concomitant implosion of public spending reduced women's ability to compete in newly liberalised labour markets.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) is changing the way modern information systems that are designed, operated, and evolved. SOC makes possible to aggregate distributed resources at the phases of decision-making support and system operations. When myriads of resources with similar functionalities are available, effective methodologies are demanded to select services and compose them as service workflows for the specified goals. The computation for workflow composition is very complex since it depends on the numbers of services and their dynamic characteristics. Therefore, composing optimized workflows in a timely manner poses a great challenge. We are highly motivated to reduce the complexity of service selection and composition. The formalized semantics in SWSpec is extended so that unqualified or inferior services can be eliminated directly from the scope of the design solution space. In this paper, a brief review of the proposed SWSpec language is given and the focus is on the sematic formalization. A new compositional proof-system is developed with a set of inference rules and the proven system properties. The proposed semantic formalization has its great significance in reducing the complexity of composing workflows and developing efficient algorithms for compliance checking.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Safety-critical systems implemented on multicore platforms need to satisfy stringent power dissipation constraints such as thermal design power (TDP) thresholds used by chip manufacturers. Power dissipation beyond TDP may trigger dynamic thermal management (DTM) in order to ensure thermal stability of the system. However, the application of DTM makes the system susceptible to higher unpredictability and performance degradations for real-time tasks. This paper proposes a formal scheduler synthesis framework that guarantees adherence to a system level peak power constraint while allowing optimal resource utilization in multicores. Our proposed framework makes use of supervisory control of timed discrete event systems as the underlying formalism. All steps starting from individual models to construction of the scheduler have been implemented through binary decision diagram based symbolic computation, so that the state-space complexity associated with the framework may be controlled. Furthermore, the synthesis framework has been extended to handle tasks with phased execution behavior. Conducted experiments have shown promising results and indicate to the practical efficacy of our approach.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation is a technique that is being used increasingly in the development and test of complex systems. Real-world testing of an intricate system in a field-like power plant can be challenging, time-consuming, expensive, and hazardous. HIL emulators allow engineers to test devices thoroughly and efficiently in a virtual environment with high reliability and minimum risk of defect. In this paper, the complete electric power system (including generator, turbine-governor, excitation system, transmission lines, transformer, external grid and related loads) is implemented in a MATLAB&#x002f;Simulink environment. Different virtual instrument pages are modeled in the graphical programming language of LabVIEW which enable fast and reliable measurement functions such as data acquisition, archiving, real-time graphical display and processing. The interaction between MATLAB and LabVIEW is accomplished by generating a Pharlap ETS Targets <sup>&#x002a;</sup>.dll file which enables the two software to exchange real-time data. Also, a real 1518-kW excitation system is considered as a test case for the introduced HIL system. This equipment is connected to LabVIEW software through a National Instrument PXI technology. Different scenarios (electrical frequency&#x002f;active power change, voltage step response, etc.) are simulated in the designed power system emulator (PSE). The validity of the implemented model for the excitation system is verified by finding good matching between MATLAB and HIL simulation results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In the past decade, network data communication has experienced a rapid growth, which has led to explosive congestion in heterogeneous networks. Moreover, the emerging industrial applications, such as automatic driving put forward higher requirements on both networks and devices. On the contrary, running computation-intensive industrial applications locally are constrained by the limited resources of devices. Correspondingly, fog computing has recently emerged to reduce the congestion of content-centric networks. It has proven to be a good way in industry and traffic for reducing network delay and processing time. In addition, device-to-device offloading is viewed as a promising paradigm to transmit network data in mobile environment, especially for autodriving vehicles. In this paper, jointly taking both the network traffic and computation workload of industrial traffic into consideration, we explore a fundamental tradeoff between energy consumption and service delay when provisioning mobile services in vehicular networks. In particular, when the available resource in mobile vehicles becomes a bottleneck, we propose a novel model to depict the users&#x2019; willingness of contributing their resources to the public. We then formulate a cost minimization problem by exploiting the framework of Markov decision progress (MDP) and propose the dynamic reinforcement learning scheduling algorithm and the deep dynamic scheduling algorithm to solve the offloading decision problem. By adopting different mobile trajectory traces, we conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. The results show that our proposed algorithms outperform other benchmark schemes in the mobile edge networks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are considered as a promising solution in intravehicle networking to reduce wiring and production costs. This application requires reliable and real-time data delivery, while the network is very dense. The time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) mode of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard provides a reliable solution for low-power networks through guaranteed medium access and channel diversity. However, satisfying the stringent requirements of in-vehicle networks is challenging and demands for special consideration in network formation and TSCH scheduling. This paper targets convergecast in dense in-vehicle WSNs, in which all nodes can potentially directly reach the sink node. A cross-layer low-latency topology management and TSCH scheduling (LLTT) technique is proposed that provides a very high timeslot utilization for the TSCH schedule and minimizes communication latency. It first picks a topology for the network that increases the potential of parallel TSCH communications. Then, by using an optimized graph isomorphism algorithm, it extracts a proper match in the physical connectivity graph of the network for the selected topology. This network topology is used by a lightweight TSCH schedule generator to provide low data delivery latency. Two techniques, namely grouped retransmission and periodic aggregation, are exploited to increase the performance of the TSCH communications. The experimental results show that LLTT reduces the end-to-end communication latency compared to other approaches, while keeping the communications reliable by using dedicated links and grouped retransmissions.

<p>In this paper, the influence of the flat and cap secondary, which are usually applied in the linear metro system on transverse forces of linear induction motors, is calculated and analyzed. First, the cap-aluminum plate and lamination back iron of the cap secondary caused relative difficulty in the analytical calculation. Then, the equivalent of the cap-aluminum plate and lamination back iron is presented, and two equivalent coefficients are obtained. The two types of the asymmetry are discussed and the different magnetic motive forces are presented. Second, the analytical model and the method of the linear induction motor are presented. Third, for a cap secondary in practice, the two equivalent coefficients are calculated and discussed. Then, the flat and cap secondary are applied, and the different transverse forces are calculated and analyzed. For two types of the secondaries, the different eddy currents and air-gap flux densities are compared. Finally, the test workbench is built and the analytical result of the transverse force is experimentally validated. It shows that cap secondary has less influence on the railcar when the transverse displacement occurs.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes and investigates an innovative methodology that can have a significant impact on the market potential of wound field, small&#x2013;medium size synchronous generators (SGs). The technique proposed here is aimed at removing the need for the traditional stator skewing that is so commonly used in SGs to achieve acceptable values of voltage total harmonic distortion. To do this, a nonstandard damper cage configuration is proposed that comprises modulation of the damper bars&#x2019; positioning. An off-the-shelf, 400-kVA generator is used as a benchmark machine. Its rotor is optimized and modified according to the proposed technique. The results of the final machine are then compared to the benchmark machine highlighting the excellent advantages that can be achieved through this technique. A full-scale prototype of the modified generator is then built to experimentally validate the concept. Finally, a detailed analysis on all the performance aspects of the prototype is carried out, to guarantee that the proposed technique has no negative impact whatsoever on the generator&#x0027;s performance.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Model-predictive current control (MPCC) is a promising candidate for modular multilevel converter (MMC) control due to its advantages of direct modeling and fast dynamic response. The conventional MPCC, which obtains the optimal control input by evaluating a cost function for all the possible switching states, may make the MPCC impractical due to the exponentially increasing computation burden with the increasing number of submodules (SMs). On the other hand, the MPCC experiences high load current and circulating current tracking errors, since only one switching state is selected and applied during one control period. To address these issues, this paper proposes an MPCC with phase-shifted pulsewidth modulation (PS-PWM) for improving the steady-state control performance. The arm voltages are considered as a whole to implement the proposed MPCC. The optimal duty cycle is obtained based on the load and circulating current tracking error minimization and applied using the PS-PWM. As a result, the computation burden is unrelated to the number of SMs by avoiding the exhaustive evaluation process for all the possible switching states. A better steady-state performance with smaller tracking errors is achieved with the similar switching frequency, and the tedious tuning process of the weighting factor is eliminated. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPCC.

<p>A nonisolated bidirectional dc&#x2013;dc converter with high voltage gain, low voltage stress, low component count, and soft-switching features is presented in this paper. In this topology, coupled inductors and voltage multiplier cells are merged to achieve high step-up&#x002f;down voltage gain. Also, due to using active clamp circuits, the voltage stress of power switches is relatively low. Thus, the low voltage switches with low on-resistance can be employed to reduce the conduction losses. Furthermore, zero-voltage switching is accomplished in both high step-up and high step-down modes for all power switches, and due to zero-current switching operation of all antiparallel diodes, the reverse recovery losses are reduced. In order to verify the theoretical analysis and the converter performance, a 200 W prototype circuit of the proposed converter is implemented in the laboratory.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The dc microgrid (MG) system has several advantages over the ac one. Therefore, it recently became a preferred architecture in numerous industrial applications. Many loads in dc MGs are electronically regulated and they challenge the stability of the system due to their constant power load (CPL) behavior. This letter proposes a systematic and simple approach to design an improved state feedback controller for the power buffer that can stabilize the dc MGs with multiple CPLs. Based on the so-called sector nonlinearity approach, the nonlinear dc MG with several CPLs is exactly represented in a Takagi&#x2013;Sugeno fuzzy model. Then, by employing the quadratic D-stability theory, the sufficient conditions to guarantee the stability and transient performance of the closed-loop system are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), such that the decay rate and oscillatory behavior of the closed-loop dc MG system are guaranteed to lie inside a predefined region. The LMI conditions can be numerically solved by utilizing the YALMIP toolbox in the MATLAB. Finally, to illustrate the merits and implementation validity of the proposed approach, some hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulation (RTS) results on a dc MG, which feeds two CPLs, are presented. In comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques, the RTS results indicate the simplicity, validity, and better performance of the proposed approach. According to the results, one can conclude that the proposed approach not only theoretically assures the stability but also guarantees the fast convergence and less oscillatory response of the dc MGs with multiple CPLs.

<p>Security surveillance is critical to social harmony and people&#x2019;s peaceful life. It has a great impact on strengthening social stability and life safeguarding. Detecting anomaly timely, effectively and efficiently in video surveillance remains challenging. This paper proposes a new approach, called  $S^{2}$ -VAE, for anomaly detection from video data. The  $S^{2}$ -VAE consists of two proposed neural networks: a Stacked Fully Connected Variational AutoEncoder ( $S_{F}$ -VAE) and a Skip Convolutional VAE ( $S_{C}$ -VAE). The  $S_{F}$ -VAE is a shallow generative network to obtain a model like Gaussian mixture to fit the distribution of the actual data. The  $S_{C}$ -VAE, as a key component of  $S^{2}$ -VAE, is a deep generative network to take advantages of CNN, VAE and skip connections. Both  $S_{F}$ -VAE and  $S_{C}$ -VAE are efficient and effective generative networks and they can achieve better performance for detecting both local abnormal events and global abnormal events. The proposed  $S^{2}$ -VAE is evaluated using four public datasets. The experimental results show that the  $S^{2}$ -VAE outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Video stabilization techniques are essential for most hand-held captured videos due to high-frequency shakes. Several 2D-, 2.5D-, and 3D-based stabilization techniques have been presented previously, but to the best of our knowledge, no solutions based on deep neural networks had been proposed to date. The main reason for this omission is shortage in training data as well as the challenge of modeling the problem using neural networks. In this paper, we present a video stabilization technique using a convolutional neural network. Previous works usually propose an off-line algorithm that smoothes a holistic camera path based on feature matching. Instead, we focus on low-latency, real-time camera path smoothing that does not explicitly represent the camera path and does not use future frames. Our neural network model, called StabNet, learns a set of mesh-grid transformations progressively for each input frame from the previous set of stabilized camera frames and creates stable corresponding latent camera paths implicitly. To train the network, we collect a dataset of synchronized steady and unsteady video pairs via a specially designed hand-held hardware. Experimental results show that our proposed online method performs comparatively to the traditional off-line video stabilization methods without using future frames while running about 10 times faster. More importantly, our proposed StabNet is able to handle low-quality videos, such as night-scene videos, watermarked videos, blurry videos, and noisy videos, where the existing methods fail in feature extraction or matching.

<p>Using multi-atlas registration (MAR), information carried by atlases can be transferred onto a new input image for the tasks of region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation, anatomical landmark detection, and so on. Conventional atlases used in MAR methods are monomodal and contain only normal anatomical structures. Therefore, the majority of MAR methods cannot handle input multimodal pathological images, which are often collected in routine image-based diagnosis. This is because registering monomodal atlases with normal appearances to multimodal pathological images involves two major problems: 1) missing imaging modalities in the monomodal atlases and 2) influence from pathological regions. In this paper, we propose a new MAR framework to tackle these problems. In this framework, deep learning-based image synthesizers are applied for synthesizing multimodal normal atlases from conventional monomodal normal atlases. To reduce the influence from pathological regions, we further propose a multimodal low-rank approach to recover multimodal normal-looking images from multimodal pathological images. Finally, the multimodal normal atlases can be registered to the recovered multimodal images in a multi-channel way. We evaluate our MAR framework via brain ROI segmentation of multimodal tumor brain images. Due to the utilization of multimodal information and the reduced influence from pathological regions, experimental results show that registration based on our method is more accurate and robust, leading to significantly improved brain ROI segmentation compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Stereoscopic saliency detection plays an important role in various stereoscopic video processing applications. However, conventional stereoscopic video saliency detection methods mainly use independent low-level features instead of extracting them automatically, and thus, they ignore the intrinsic relationship between the spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel stereoscopic video saliency detection method based on 3D convolutional neural networks, namely, deep 3D video saliency (Deep3DSaliency). The proposed network consists of two sub-models: spatiotemporal saliency model (STSM) and stereoscopic saliency aware model (SSAM). STSM directly takes three consecutive video frames as the input to extract visual spatiotemporal features, while SSAM attempts to further infer the depth and semantic features from the left and right video frames by shared parameters from STSM. The visual spatiotemporal features from STSM and the depth and semantic features from SSAM are learned by an alternating optimization scheme. Finally, all these saliency-related features are combined together for the final stereoscopic saliency detection via 3D deconvolution. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed model over other existing ones in saliency estimation for 3D video sequences.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The 360&#x00b0; video compression has two main challenges due to projection distortions, namely, the geometry distortion and the face boundary discontinuity. There are some tradeoffs between selecting equi-rectangular projection (ERP) and polyhedron projection. In ERP, the geometry distortion is severer than the face boundary discontinuity; while for the polyhedron projections, the face boundary discontinuity is severer than the geometry distortion. These two distortions will have side effects on the motion compensation and undermine the compression efficiency of the 360&#x00b0; video. In this paper, an integrated framework is developed to handle these two problems to improve coding efficiency. The proposed framework mainly has two key contributions. First, we derive a unified advanced spherical motion model to handle the geometry distortion of different projection formats for the 360&#x00b0; video. When fitting the projection between the various projection formats and the sphere into the unified framework, a specific solution can be obtained for each projection format. Second, we propose a local 3D padding method to handle the face boundary discontinuity between the neighboring faces in various projection formats of the 360&#x00b0; video. The local 3D padding method can be applied to different projection formats through setting different angles between neighboring faces. These two methods are independent of each other and can also be combined into an integrated framework to achieve a better rate-distortion performance. The proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into the latest video coding standard high-efficiency video coding. The experimental results demonstrate that introducing proposed coding tools can achieve significant bitrate savings compared with the current state-of-the-art method.

<p>The thermal camera can capture keyboard surface temperature change after a human&#x2019;s touch. This phenomenon may be used to steal users&#x2019; passwords physically. In this paper, based on the study of thermal dynamics of keyboards, we design a password break system using an infrared thermal camera. First, we build a signal model to describe the dynamic process of temperature change on the keyboard using Newton&#x2019;s law of cooling. Next, we develop a maximum likelihood parameter estimation algorithm to estimate the keystroke time instants. Then, by maximizing the probability of key order arrangement, a novel password breaking algorithm is developed. Our algorithm is tested using simulated data as well as real-world data. Experiment results show that our algorithm is effective for physical password breaking using thermal characteristics. Based on our results, we discuss strategies for password protection at the end.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The forensic investigation of JPEG compression generally relies on the analysis of first-order statistics based on image histogram. The JPEG compression detection methods based on such methodology can be effortlessly circumvented by adopting some anti-forensic attacks. This paper presents a counter JPEG anti-forensic method by considering the second-order statistical analysis based on the co-occurrence matrices (CMs). The proposed framework comprises three stages: selection of the target difference image, evaluation of CMs, and generation of second-order statistical feature based on CMs. In the first stage, we explore the effects of dithering operation of JPEG anti-forensics by analyzing the variance inconsistencies along the diagonals. Afterward, CMs are evaluated in the second stage to highlight the effects of grainy noise introduced during the dithering operation. The third stage is devoted to generate an optimal second-order statistical feature which is fed to the SVM classifier. The experimental results based on the uncompressed color image database and BOSSBase dataset images demonstrated that the proposed forensic detector based on CM is very efficient even in the presence of anti-forensic attacks. Moreover, the experimental results also confirm the competency of the proposed method in counter median filtering and contrast enhancement anti-forensics. The proposed scheme also provides satisfactory results in detecting other image processing operations such as mean filtering, Gaussian filtering, Weiner filtering, scaling, and rotation, thereby revealing its multi-purpose nature.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We study deterministic approximations of the Gaussian two-user multiple access wiretap channel (G-MAC-WT) and the Gaussian wiretap channel with a helper (G-WT-H). These approximations enable results beyond the recently shown 2/3 and 1/2 secure degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) for the G-MAC-WT and the G-WT-H, respectively. While the s.d.o.f. were obtained by real interference alignment, our approach uses signal-scale alignment. We show achievable schemes which are independent of the rationality of the channel gains. Moreover, our results can differentiate between channel strengths, in particular, between both users, and will establish secrecy rates dependent on this difference. We can show that the resulting achievable secrecy rates tend to the s.d.o.f. for vanishing channel gain differences. Moreover, we extend previous and develop new techniques to prove generalized s.d.o.f. bounds for varying channel strengths and show that our achievable schemes reach the bounds for certain channel gain parameters. We believe that our analysis is the next step toward a constant-gap analysis of the G-MAC-WT and the G-WT-H.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Multiple user active authentications, in contrast with the single user active authentication, require the verification of identity of multiple subjects. Both traditional verification and identification-based solutions fail to address the specific challenges presented in this problem. We introduce Extremal Openset Rejection, a two-fold mechanism with a sparse representation-based identification step and a verification step for this purpose. In the verification step, concentration of the sparsity vector and the overlap between matched and non-matched distributions are considered for decision making. We introduce a semi-parametric model based on Extreme Value Theory for modeling the distributions, and an algorithm to estimate the parameters of extreme value distributions. Effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using three publicly available face-based mobile active authentication data sets.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>As one of the most widely used clustering techniques, the fuzzy  $k$ -means (FKM) assigns every data point to each cluster with a certain degree of membership. However, conventional FKM approach relies on the square data fitting term, which is sensitive to the outliers with ignoring the prior information. In this paper, we develop a novel and robust fuzzy  $k$ -means clustering algorithm, namely, joint learning of fuzzy  $k$ -means and nonnegative spectral clustering with side information. The proposed method combines fuzzy  $k$ -means and nonnegative spectral clustering into a unified model, which can further exploit the prior knowledge of data pairs such that both the quality of affinity graph and the clustering performance can be improved. In addition, for the purpose of enhancing the robustness, the adaptive loss function is adopted in the objective function, since it smoothly interpolates between  $ell _{1}$ -norm and  $ell _{2}$ -norm. Finally, experimental results on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness and the superiority of our clustering method.
