<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The emerging parallel chain protocols represent a breakthrough to address the
scalability of blockchain. By composing multiple parallel chain instances, the
whole systems' throughput can approach the network capacity. How to coordinate
different chains' blocks and to construct them into a global ordering is
critical to the performance of parallel chain protocol. However, the existed
solutions use either the global synchronization clock with the single-chain
bottleneck or pre-defined ordering sequences with distortion of blocks'
causality to order blocks. In addition, the prior ordering methods rely on that
honest participants faithfully follow the ordering protocol, but remain silent
for any denial of ordering (DoR) attack.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the conflicting transactions included into the global
block sequence will make Simple Payment Verification (SPV) difficult. Clients
usually need to store a full record of transactions to distinguish the
conflictions and tell whether transactions are confirmed. However, the
requirement for a full record will greatly hinder blockchains' application,
especially for mobile scenarios.
</p>
<p>In this technical report, we propose Eunomia, which leverages logical clock
and fine-grained UTXO sharding to realize a simple, efficient, secure and
permissionless parallel chain protocol. By observing the characteristics of the
parallel chain, we find the blocks ordering issue in parallel chain has many
similarities with the event ordering in the distributed system. Eunomia thus
adopts "virtual" logical clock, which is optimized to have the minimum protocol
overhead and runs in a distributed way. In addition, Eunomia combines the
mining incentive with block ordering, providing incentive compatibility against
DoR attack. What's more, the fine-grained UTXO sharding does well solve the
conflicting transactions in parallel chain and is shown to be SPV-friendly.

<p>Biological cells can transmit, process and receive chemically encoded data in
the same way as network devices transmit, process, and receive digitally
encoded data. Communication protocols have led to the rapid development of
computer networks. Therefore, we need to develop communication protocols for
biological cell networks, which will lead to significant development,
especially in medical applications where surgery or delivery of drugs can be
performed using nanoscale devices. Blockchain is a peer-to-peer network that
contains a series of clusters to make a valid and secure transaction. Blockhain
technology is used in many areas such as e-commerce, public services, security,
finance, Internet stuff, etc. Although blockchain has a major impact on
Internet technology, it suffers from time problems and scalability. DNA
computing is the execution of computations using natural molecules, especially
DNA. DNA gaps above silicon because of massive parallelism, size and storage
density. In this paper, biological cells and DNA are used to create the
necessary protocols for the networks to be used in the performance of the
cell-based communication system. The proposed hybrid solution involves DNA as
well as calculated on an enzymatic basis, where each contributes to the
function of a given protocol. Also a correspondence between blockchain and DNA
is proposed that can be utilized to create DNA based blockchain.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Publishing physical activity data can facilitate reproducible health-care
research in several areas such as population health management, behavioral
health research, and management of chronic health problems. However, publishing
such data also brings high privacy risks related to re-identification which
makes anonymization necessary. One of the challenges in anonymizing physical
activity data collected periodically is its sequential nature. The existing
anonymization techniques work sufficiently for cross-sectional data but have
high computational costs when applied directly to sequential data. This paper
presents an effective anonymization approach, Multi-level Clustering based
anonymization to anonymize physical activity data. Compared with the
conventional methods, the proposed approach improves time complexity by
reducing the clustering time drastically. While doing so, it preserves the
utility as much as the conventional approaches.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>CSIDH is a recent quantum-resistant primitive based on the difficulty of
finding isogeny paths between supersingular curves. Recently, two constant-time
versions of CSIDH have been proposed: first by Meyer, Campos and Reith, and
then by Onuki, Aikawa, Yamazaki and Takagi. While both offer protection against
timing attacks and simple power consumption analysis, they are vulnerable to
more powerful attacks such as fault injections. In this work, we identify and
repair two oversights in these algorithms that compromised their constant-time
character. By exploiting Edwards arithmetic and optimal addition chains, we
produce the fastest constant-time version of CSIDH to date. We then consider
the stronger attack scenario of fault injection, which is relevant for the
security of CSIDH static keys in embedded hardware. We propose and evaluate a
dummy-free CSIDH algorithm. While these CSIDH variants are slower, their
performance is still within a small constant factor of less-protected variants.
Finally, we discuss derandomized CSIDH algorithms.

<p>It has recently been shown that cryptographic trilinear maps are sufficient
for achieving indistinguishability obfuscation. In this paper we develop a
method for constructing such maps on the Weil descent (restriction) of abelian
varieties over finite fields, including the Jacobian varieties of hyperelliptic
curves and elliptic curves. The security of these candidate cryptographic
trilinear maps raises several interesting questions, including the
computational complexity of a trapdoor discrete logarithm problem.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>During the last decades, the problem of malicious and unwanted software (malware) has surged in numbers and sophistication. Malware plays a key role in most of today's cyberattacks and has consolidated as a commodity in the underground economy. In this paper, we analyze the evolution of malware from 1975 to date from a software engineering perspective. We analyze the source code of 456 samples from 428 unique families and obtain measures of their size, code quality, and estimates of the development costs (effort, time, and number of people). Our results suggest an exponential increment of nearly one order of magnitude per decade in aspects such as size and estimated effort, with code quality metrics similar to those of benign software. We also study the extent to which code reuse is present in our dataset. We detect a significant number of code clones across malware families and report which features and functionalities are more commonly shared. Overall, our results support claims about the increasing complexity of malware and its production progressively becoming an industry.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In cyberspace, evolutionary strategies are commonly used by both attackers and defenders. For example, an attacker's strategy often changes over the course of time, as new vulnerabilities are discovered and/or mitigated. Similarly, a defender's strategy changes over time. These changes may or may not be in direct response to a change in the opponent's strategy. In any case, it is important to have a set of quantitative metrics to characterize and understand the effectiveness of attackers' and defenders' evolutionary strategies, which reflect their cyber agility. Despite its clear importance, few systematic metrics have been developed to quantify the cyber agility of attackers and defenders. In this paper, we propose the first metric framework for measuring cyber agility in terms of the effectiveness of the dynamic evolution of cyber attacks and defenses. The proposed framework is generic and applicable to transform any relevant, quantitative, and/or conventional static security metrics (e.g., false positives and false negatives) into dynamic metrics to capture dynamics of system behaviors. In order to validate the usefulness of the proposed framework, we conduct case studies on measuring the evolution of cyber attacks and defenses using two real-world datasets. We discuss the limitations of the current work and identify future research directions.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Family health history (FHH) is the most useful means of assessing risk for common chronic diseases. The odds ratio for risk of developing disease with a positive FHH is frequently greater than 2, and actions can be taken to mitigate risk by adhering to screening guidelines, genetic counselling, genetic risk testing, and other screening methods. Challenges to the routine acquisition of FHH include constraints on provider time to collect data and the difficulty in accessing risk calculators. Disease-specific and broader risk assessment software platforms have been developed, many with clinical decision support and informatics interoperability, but few access patient information directly.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A key problem in co-saliency detection is how to effectively model the interactive relationship of a whole image group and the individual perspective of each image in a united data-driven manner. In this paper, we propose a group-wise deep co-saliency detection approach to address the co-saliency object discovery problem based on the fully convolutional network (FCN). The proposed approach captures the group-wise interaction information for group images by learning a semantics-aware image representation based on a convolutional neural network, which adaptively learns the group-wise features for co-saliency detection. Furthermore, the proposed approach discovers the collaborative and interactive relationships between group-wise feature representation and single-image individual feature representation and models this in a collaborative learning framework. Then, we set up a unified deep learning scheme to jointly optimize the process of group-wise feature representation learning and collaborative learning, leading to more reliable and robust co-saliency detection results. Finally, we present a graph Laplacian regularized nonlinear regression model for saliency refinement. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Motion compensation has been widely employed for removing temporal redundancies in typical hybrid video coding framework. The popular video compression standards, such as H.264/AVC and HEVC, adopt the block-based partitioning model to describe the motion field due to its high-compression efficiency and relatively low-computational complexity. However, block-based motion compensation may not align with the actual object motion boundaries, potentially limiting the compression efficiency. In view of this, we propose a three-zone segmentation-based motion compensation scheme to improve the description accuracy of motion field as well as the coding efficiency. In particular, the segmentation information is implied in the reference frame instead of being explicitly signalled. Based on the segmentation information, three motion compensation zones can be identified, including one edge, one foreground, and one background zone. The foreground zone is motion compensated by the signalled motion vector of the block, and the background zone is motion compensated by the motion information implicitly derived from the local motion field. Regarding the edge zone, it is viewed as an overlapped area and the weighted compensation strategy is adopted. The proposed algorithm is implemented into the reference software VTM-1.0 of versatile video coding (VVC), and the simulation results show that the algorithm can achieve 1.14&#x0025; and 1.06&#x0025; bitrate savings for random access and low-delay configurations, respectively.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Developing an automatic age estimation method toward human faces continues to possess an important role in computer vision and pattern recognition. Many studies regarding facial age estimation mainly focus on two aspects: facial aging feature extraction and classification/regression model learning. To set our work apart from existing age estimation approaches, we consider a different aspect&#x2014;system structuring, which is under a constrained condition: given a fixed feature type and a fixed learning method, how to design a framework to improve the age estimation performance based on the constraint? We propose a four-stage fusion framework for facial age estimation. This framework starts from gender recognition, then goes to the second phase, gender-specific age grouping, followed by the third stage, age estimation within age groups, and finally ends at the fusion stage. In the experiment, three well-known benchmark datasets, MORPH-II, FG-NET, and CLAP2016, are adopted to validate the procedure. The experimental results show that the performance can be significantly improved by using our proposed framework and this framework also outperforms several state-of-the-art age estimation methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we present a novel approach to find informative and anomalous samples in videos exploiting the concept of typicality from information theory. In most video analysis tasks, selection of the most informative samples from a huge pool of training data in order to learn a good recognition model is an important problem. Furthermore, it is also useful to reduce the annotation cost, as it is time-consuming to annotate unlabeled samples. Typicality is a simple and powerful technique, which can be applied to compress the training data to learn a good classification model. In a continuous video clip, an activity shares a strong correlation with its previous activities. We assume that the activity samples that appear in a video form a Markov chain. We explicitly show how typicality can be utilized in this scenario. We compute an atypical score for a sample using typicality and the Markovian property, which can be applied to two challenging vision problems: 1) sample selection for learning activity recognition models and 2) anomaly detection. In the first case, our approach leads to a significant reduction in manual labeling cost while achieving similar or better recognition performance compared with a model trained with the entire training set. For the latter case, the atypical score has been exploited in identifying anomalous activities in videos, where our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework over other recent strategies.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Participatory sensing is a crowdsourcing-based framework, where the platform executes the sensing requests with the help of many common peoples&#x2019; handheld devices (typically smartphones). In this paper, we mainly address the online sensing request admission and smartphone selection problem to maximize the profit of the platform, taking into account the queue backlog, and the location of sensing requests and smartphones. First, we formulate this problem as a discrete time model and design a location aware online admission and selection control algorithm (LAAS) based on the Lyapunov optimization technique. The LAAS algorithm only depends on the currently available information and makes all the control decisions independently and simultaneously. Next, we utilize the recent advancement of the accurate prediction of smartphones&#x2019; mobility and sensing request arrival information in the next few time slots and develop a predictive location aware admission and selection control algorithm (PLAAS). We further design a greedy predictive location aware admission and selection control algorithm (GPLAAS) to achieve the online implementation of PLAAS approximately and iteratively. Theoretical analysis shows that under any control parameter V &gt; 0, both LAAS and PLAAS algorithm can achieve O(1&#x002f;V)-optimal average profit, while the sensing request backlog is bounded by O(V). Extensive numerical results based on both synthetic and real trace show that LAAS outperforms the Greedy algorithm and Random algorithm and GPLAAS improves the profit-backlog tradeoff over LAAS.

<p>This paper presents an energy management method to optimally control the energy supply and the temperature settings of distributed heating and ventilation systems for residential buildings. The control model attempts to schedule the supply and demand simultaneously with the purpose of minimizing the total costs. Moreover, the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) model is introduced into the consumers&#x2019; cost functions and the quadratic fitting method is applied to simplify the PPD model. An energy management algorithm is developed to seek the optimal temperature settings, the energy supply, and the price. Furthermore, due to the ubiquity of price oscillations in electricity markets, we analyze and examine the effects of price oscillations on the performance of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the theoretical analysis and simulation results both demonstrate that the proposed energy management algorithm with price oscillations can converge to a region around the optimal solution.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The deployment of smart hybrid heat pumps (SHHPs) can introduce considerable benefits to electricity systems via smart switching between electricity and gas while minimizing the total heating cost for each individual customer. In particular, the fully optimized control technology can provide flexible heat that redistributes the heat demand across time for improving the utilization of low-carbon generation and enhancing the overall energy efficiency of the heating system. To this end, an accurate quantification of the preheating is of great importance to characterize the flexible heat. This paper proposes a novel data-driven preheating quantification method to estimate the capability of the heat pump demand shifting and isolate the effect of interventions. Varieties of fine-grained data from a real-world trial are exploited to estimate the baseline heat demand using Bayesian deep learning while jointly considering epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. A comprehensive range of case studies are carried out to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed quantification method, and then, the estimated demand shift is used as an input into the whole-system model to investigate the system implications and quantify the range of benefits of rolling out the SHHPs developed by PassivSystems to the future GB electricity systems.

In this paper, a concise yet comprehensive analysis and comparison are presented for these techniques. First, modeling methods are implemented to find appropriate and precise forecasting models for PV, PEV, HP, and home load demand. Then, the accuracy of each model is validated by the real measured data. Finally, the pros and cons of each method are discussed and reviewed.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper investigates the residential energy management problems in the power-heat-coupling system. For better solving this issue, based on the novel concept of We-Energy (WE) for energy Internet (EI), this paper proposes a residential WE (R-WE) framework faced by the terminal users who play an important role in renewable energy consumption. Inspired by the full-duplex feature of R-WE, the power and heat supply-demand balance constraints are fulfilled in a regional unit of EI, but it may be inequality constraints for corresponding consumer, producer, or WE operation modes in only one R-WE. The R-WE framework can be classified into four operation modes, which is island mode, consumer mode, producer mode, and WE mode. On this basis, the R-WE models cooperate to achieve the objective of minimizing the operation costs, smoothing out the loads&#x2019; variations, and renewable resource fluctuations. Specifically, the R-WE framework with respect to the heat-power-coupling problem can be solved in the distributed double-consensus algorithm (DDCA), which is designed two sets of consensus algorithms by using four completely different consensus variables to calculate the power and heat multipliers, evaluate the power and heat generations and, thereby, further obtain the power mismatches of electricity and heat. Also, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimal conditions of the proposed DDCA is further proved. Meanwhile, a novel projection operation method for combined heat and power devices is designed to take the infeasible solutions mapped into the feasible region. Finally, the simulation results in different cases further demonstrate that the proposed R-WE frame can be an appropriate method to analyze the terminal consumers and harmonize multienergy producers in the process of constructing EI projects. And an R-WE framework of the campus has experimented with minority loads in island mode.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Clothing and carrying status variations are the two key factors that affect the performance of gait recognition because people usually wear various clothes and carry all kinds of objects, while walking in their daily life. These covariates substantially affect the intensities within conventional gait representations such as gait energy images. Hence, to properly compare a pair of input gait features, an appropriate metric for joint intensity is needed in addition to the conventional spatial metric. We therefore propose a unified joint intensity transformer network for gait recognition that is robust against various clothing and carrying statuses. Specifically, the joint intensity transformer network is a unified deep learning-based architecture containing three parts: a joint intensity metric estimation net, a joint intensity transformer, and a discrimination network. First, the joint intensity metric estimation net uses a well-designed encoder-decoder network to estimate a sample-dependent joint intensity metric for a pair of input gait energy images. Subsequently, a joint intensity transformer module outputs the spatial dissimilarity of two gait energy images using the metric learned by the joint intensity metric estimation net. Third, the discrimination network is a generic convolution neural network for gait recognition. In addition, the joint intensity transformer network is designed with different loss functions depending on the gait recognition task (i.e., a contrastive loss function for the verification task and a triplet loss function for the identification task). The experiments on the world&#x2019;s largest datasets containing various clothing and carrying statuses demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>At present, the fusion of different unimodal biometrics has attracted increasing attention from researchers, who are dedicated to the practical application of biometrics. In this paper, we explored a multi-biometric algorithm that integrates palmprints and dorsal hand veins (DHV). Palmprint recognition has a rather high accuracy and reliability, and the most significant advantage of DHV recognition is the biopsy (Liveness detection). In order to combine the advantages of both and implement the fusion method, deep learning and graph matching were, respectively, introduced to identify palmprint and DHV. Upon using the deep hashing network (DHN), biometric images can be encoded as 128-bit codes. Then, the Hamming distances were used to represent the similarity of two codes. Biometric graph matching (BGM) can obtain three discriminative features for classification. In order to improve the accuracy of open-set recognition, in multi-modal fusion, the score-level fusion of DHN and BGM was performed and authentication was provided by support vector machine (SVM). Furthermore, based on DHN, all four levels of fusion strategies were used for multi-modal recognition of palmprint and DHV. Evaluation experiments and comprehensive comparisons were conducted on various commonly used datasets, and the promising results were obtained in this case where the equal error rates (EERs) of both palmprint recognition and multi-biometrics equal 0, demonstrating the great superiority of DHN in biometric verification.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We propose a novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-inspired jamming and relaying scheme to enhance the physical layer security of untrusted relay networks. Particularly, during the first phase, with the application of the downlink NOMA principle, the source sends a superimposed version of a desired signal and a jamming signal, where the jamming signal is designed to deliberately confuse the untrusted relay by exploiting the beamforming design and adapting the transmission rate at the source. During the second phase, relying on the uplink NOMA principle, the untrusted relay forwards its received signals and, simultaneously, the source transmits a new desired signal that cannot be wiretapped by the untrusted relay to maximize the secrecy sum rate. Scenarios of single-antenna and multiple-antenna relaying are considered, and the impact of different antenna configurations at the source and the untrusted relay on the secrecy performance is investigated. Analytical expressions of an ergodic secrecy sum rate (ESSR) lower bound and an asymptotic ESSR scaling law are derived to evaluate the secrecy performance of the proposed NOMA-inspired jamming and relaying scheme. Computer simulations are presented to validate the accuracy of the derived analytical results, and demonstrate the significant ESSR improvement of the proposed scheme over the conventional orthogonal multiple access-based relaying schemes.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>AC&#x2013;DC light-emitting diode (LED) drivers suffer from short lifetime because of the low-lifetime electrolytic capacitors used for dc bus decoupling. In this paper, a primary-side peak current control method applied for driving a two-stage multichannel LED driver is proposed. The LED driver consists of an ac&#x2013;dc boost power factor correction stage and an isolated dc&#x2013;dc nonresonant stage. A long-lifetime and small film capacitor is used for implementing the intermediate dc bus. The proposed method, which controls the peak value of the primary-side current of the transformers, is applied to the dc&#x2013;dc stage to ensure constant dc current output of LEDs in spite of the widely varying dc bus voltage due to low bus capacitance. The proposed method compensates the effect of the large dc bus voltage ripple by varying the switching frequency of the primary-side switches. Detailed design procedure, theoretical analysis, and experimental results of the LED driver operating at 180 W with the proposed method are provided. The LED driver with the proposed control method is proved to have high overall efficiency.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The objective of this paper is to develop a method for assisting users to push power-assisted wheelchairs (PAWs) in such a way that the electrical energy consumption over a predefined distance-to-go is optimal, while at the same time bringing users to a desired fatigue level. This assistive task is formulated as an optimal control problem and solved by Feng et al. using the model-free approach gradient of partially observable Markov decision processes. To increase the data efficiency of the model-free framework, we here propose to use policy learning by weighting exploration with the returns (PoWER) with 25 control parameters. Moreover, we provide a new near-optimality analysis of the finite-horizon fuzzy Q-iteration, which derives a model-based baseline solution to verify numerically the near-optimality of the presented model-free approaches. Simulation results show that the PoWER algorithm with the new parameterization converges to a near-optimal solution within 200 trials and possesses the adaptability to cope with changes of the human fatigue dynamics. Finally, 24 experimental trials are carried out on the PAW system, with fatigue feedback provided by the user via a joystick. The performance tends to increase gradually after learning. The results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness and the feasibility of PoWER in our application.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent years have witnessed the promising future of hashing in the industrial applications for fast similarity retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised hashing method for large-scale cross-media search, termed self-supervised deep multimodal hashing (SSDMH), which learns unified hash codes as well as deep hash functions for different modalities in a self-supervised manner. With the proposed regularized binary latent model, unified binary codes can be solved directly without relaxation strategy while retaining the neighborhood structures by the graph regularization term. Moreover, we propose a new discrete optimization solution, termed as binary gradient descent, which aims at improving the optimization efficiency toward real-time operation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets demonstrate the superiority of SSDMH over state-of-the-art cross-media hashing approaches.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With a large number of video surveillance systems installed for the requirement from industrial security, the task of object tracking, which aims to locate objects of interest in videos, is very important. Although numerous tracking algorithms for RGB videos have been developed in the decade, the tracking performance and robustness of these systems may be degraded dramatically when the information from RGB video is unreliable (e.g., poor illumination conditions or very low resolution). To address this issue, this paper presents a new tracking system, which aims to combine the information from RGB and infrared modalities for object tracking. The proposed tracking systems is based on our proposed machine learning model. Particularly, the learning model can alleviate the modality discrepancy issue under the proposed modality consistency constraint from both representation patterns and discriminability, and generate discriminative feature templates for collaborative representations and discrimination in heterogeneous modalities. Experiments on a variety of challenging RGB-infrared videos demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The ability to recognize actions throughout a video is essential for surveillance, self-driving, and many other applications. Although many researchers have investigated deep neural networks to get a better result in video action recognition, these networks usually require a large number of well-labeled data to train. In this paper, we introduce a dense dilated network to collect action information from snippet-level to global-level. The dilated dense network is composed of the blocks with densely connected dilated convolutions layers. Our proposed framework is capable of fusing outputs from each layer to learn high-level representations, and these representations are robust even with only a few training snippets. We study different spatial and temporal modality fusing configurations and introduce a novel temporal guided fusion upon the dense dilated network which can further boost the performance. We conduct extensive experiments on two popular video action datasets: UCF101 and HMDB51. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
