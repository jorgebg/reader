<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Robust and efficient image alignment remains a challenging task, due to the massiveness of images, great illumination variations between images, partial occlusion, and corruption. To address these challenges, we propose an online image alignment method via subspace learning from image gradient orientations (IGOs). The proposed method integrates the subspace learning, transformed the IGO reconstruction and image alignment into a unified online framework, which is robust for aligning images with severe intensity distortions. Our method is motivated by a principal component analysis (PCA) from gradient orientations that provides more reliable low-dimensional subspace than that from pixel intensities. Instead of processing in the intensity-domain-like conventional methods, we seek alignment in the IGO domain, such that the aligned IGO of the newly arrived image can be decomposed as the sum of a sparse error and a linear composition of the IGO-PCA basis learned from previously well-aligned ones. The optimization problem is tackled by an iterative linearization that minimizes the &#x2113;<sub>1</sub>-norm of the sparse error. Furthermore, the IGO-PCA basis is adaptively updated based on incremental thin singular value decomposition, which takes the shift of IGO mean into consideration. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated on the extensive challenging datasets through image alignment, medical atlas construction, and face recognition. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm provides more illumination- and occlusion-robust image alignment than the state-of-the-art methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel approach to convolutional sparse representation with the aim of resolving the dictionary learning problem. The proposed method, referred to as the adaptive alternating direction method of multipliers (AADMM), employs constraints comprising non-convex, nonsmooth terms, such as the &#x2113;<sub>0</sub>-norm imposed on the coefficients and the unit-norm sphere imposed on the length of each dictionary element. The proposed scheme incorporates a novel parameter adaption scheme that enables ADMM to achieve convergence more quickly, as evidenced by numerical and theoretical analysis. In experiments involving image signal applications, the dictionaries learned using AADMM outperformed those learned using comparable dictionary learning methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Existing research on vulnerability discovery models shows that the existence of vulnerabilities inside an application may be linked to certain features, e.g., size or complexity, of that application. However, the applicability of such features to demonstrate the relative security between two applications is not well studied, which may depend on multiple factors in a complex way. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale empirical study of the correlation between various features of applications and the abundance of vulnerabilities. Unlike existing work, which typically focuses on one particular application, resulting in limited successes, we focus on the more realistic issue of assessing the relative security level among different applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study of 780 real-world applications involving 6498 vulnerabilities. We apply seven feature selection methods to nine feature subsets selected among 34 collected features, which are then fed into six types of machine learning models, producing 523 estimations. The predictive power of important features is evaluated using four different performance measures. This paper reflects that the complexity of applications is not the only factor in vulnerability discovery and the human-related factors contribute to explaining the number of discovered vulnerabilities in an application.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we address the problem of forensic photo carving, which serves as one of the key sources of digital evidence in modern law enforcement. We propose efficient algorithms for assembling meaningful photographs from orphaned photofragments, carved without access to file headers, meta-data, or compression settings. The addressed problem raises a novel variant of a jigsaw puzzle with an unknown number of mixed images, missing pieces, and severe brightness and colorization artifacts. We construct an efficient compatibility metric for matching puzzle pieces and a corresponding image stitching procedure which allows us to mitigate these artifacts. To facilitate photo assembly, we perform a forensic analysis of the fragments to provide clues about their location within the frame of the imaging sensor. The proposed algorithm formulates the assembly problem as finding non-overlapping sets in an interval graph spanned over the input fragments. The algorithm exhibits lower computational complexity compared with a popular puzzle-solving approach based on minimal spanning trees.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In recent studies, a simple non-coherent communication scheme based on energy detection is proposed in massive single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems. Before data transmission, the transmitter sends pilots to the receiver for the purpose of estimating the channel statistics. However, this training phase unintentionally provides opportunity for a malicious jammer to attack legitimate communication. In order to secure the legitimate communication, this paper proposes a jamming detection method in non-coherent SIMO systems, in which the information of channel statistics is not required. First, the transmitter sends pilots to the receiver, then the receiver sends the conjugate of its received signal (which may contain jammer signal) back to the transmitter, where the final decision on jamming detection is made. According to the likelihood ratio test principle, two detectors based on variance and standard variance normalization are proposed. The performance analysis indicates that these two detectors are of similar detection performance but of different complexity. Furthermore, it is revealed that the probability of detection initially grows with the number of receive antennas but converges quickly then, whereas the channel statistics from the jammer to the receiver always greatly influences the performance. Finally, the numerical simulations are carried out to validate the proposed detection method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Currently, much attention has been paid to reversible data hiding (RDH) in an encrypted domain due to the popular deployment of cloud storage. However, nearly all existing RDH schemes in the encrypted domain are proposed for raster images, and very little work has been done to 2D vector graphics, which are represented in real numbers. In this paper, a reversible mapping model for real numbers is first built. It maps the points in  $R^{n}$  to  $2^{s}$  non-intersecting subsets in  $R^{n}$ , which guarantees that  $s$  bits can be embedded into each real number. Based on the model, an RDH scheme in encrypted 2D vector graphics is put forward. In the scheme, a user encrypts 2D engineering graphics and stores them in the cloud, and then the cloud service provider can perform information hiding, extraction, and even recover the encrypted 2D vector graphics. For the authorized user, it can acquire the recovered 2D vector graphics from the cloud and obtain their original versions after decryption. For an unauthorized user, he can only acquire the encrypted 2D vector graphics with a hidden message, and only approximate 2D vector graphics can be obtained even if he knows the decryption key but does not know the hiding key. The experimental results and analysis show that it can strike a good balance between security, distortion, and capacity. It provides a new paradigm for RDH in the encrypted domain for the data represented in real numbers.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A remarkable characteristic of the modern operating system is open, which means that we can download data or execute codes from any Internet sources whether they are trusted or not. Therefore, there is a contradict situation when we want to use these data or codes as well as keep the system secured. Despite decades of studies and experiences on this problem, it is still assumed as a great challenge. This paper presents a novel dynamic defense model (DDM) to reduce security risks brought by these suspicious data or codes for the open operating systems. DDM is a high-level security defense abstraction with four key components: dynamic label marking, dynamic label tracking, dynamic label modulating, and run-time controlling. With these components, DDM achieves the full, dynamic, and real-time security protection in the whole life cycle of the operating system. We also practically implemented a prototype system named DDDroid on Android. We constructed a mixed experimental dataset with 30 malware samples and 970 benign applications to test the defense effects of DDDroid. DDDroid detects 97&#x0025; of the malware samples that have malicious actions and blocks these actions with a negligible false positive on legal actions. We also demonstrated that DDDroid is an effective system, which prevents sensitive data from being leaked by suspicious applications deliberately or by users unintentionally through some sample experiments. What is more, with extensive evaluations, DDDroid is proved to be a system with low-performance overhead and limited memory consumption.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a distributed cooperative control scheme, considering the state-of-charge balance and power limits of battery-storage units (BSUs) in the consensus protocol, is proposed to achieve the average bus voltage consensus in a dc microgrid with photovoltaics. The state variable defined in the consensus protocol enables all BSUs to charge or discharge together without introducing circulating currents among BSUs. Furthermore, by incorporating power limits of BSUs in the defined state variable, power violation of the BSUs can be prevented. The consensus-based distributed control only utilizes neighbor-to-neighbor communication to realize the global consensus, and, thus, avoids the single point of the failure compared to the conventional centralized control. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in an islanded dc microgrid under different testing scenarios.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Converter-driven direct current (dc) motors exhibit various advantages in industry, but impose several challenges to higher precision speed regulation in the presence of parametric uncertainties and exogenous, time-varying load torque disturbances. In this paper, the robust predictive speed regulation problem of a generic dc&#x2013;dc buck converter-driven permanent magnet dc motors is addressed by using an output feedback discrete-time model predictive control algorithm. A new discrete-time reduced-order generalized proportional-integral observer (GPIO) is proposed to reconstruct the virtual system states as well as the lumped disturbances. The estimates of GPIO are then collected for output speed prediction. An optimized duty ratio law of the converter is obtained by solving a constrained receding horizon optimization problem, where the operational constraint on control input is explicitly taken into account. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed new algorithm is demonstrated by various experimental testing results.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the automated demand response (DR) problem in smart grids equipped with information and communication technology networks, where power generating and consuming units can exchange information as a multiagent system (MAS), and a real-time pricing (RTP) scheme is proposed. When the communication graph among agents is connected, a novel parallel and distributed consensus-based algorithm is proposed to derive an RTP scheme to facilitate DR, and when communication uncertainties exist, a robust consensus algorithm is proposed to cease the effect of uncertainties. Next, this paper proposes a novel control mechanism to tackle the problem of disconnected communication among agents, e.g., under cyber-attacks, by employing the so-called mixed communication-broadcast control architecture where the underlying ideas are twofold. First, each area in the grid associated with a connected subgraph is controlled by a MAS to guarantee the power balance and to reach consensus on the local electric price for that area. Second, a supervisory unit observes those local electric prices to calculate the global electric price for the whole grid and then broadcasts to all units so that they can properly adjust their output powers. Simulations are carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system to validate the proposed control mechanisms.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents an electric arc furnace (EAF) optimization framework intended to define optimal control profiles for the EAF, in order to increase its efficiency and thus reduce the energy consumption. The framework aims to minimize controllable losses and to maximize energy transfer to the bath and, consequently, minimize the operational costs. This is achieved through improved actuation of the EAF inputs, i.e., transformer power, oxygen lancing, and carbon addition. To achieve maximal energy transfer to the bath and to reduce the heat losses from the arcs, proper properties of the slag, such as foaminess and basicity, are a subject of considerable attention. The framework is designed as a model-based optimization, intended to be executed online in parallel to the actual EAF process. In order to achieve sufficiently low computational complexity and to allow process optimization by arbitrary time intervals, the framework uses path constraints instead of end-point constraints. A combination of several optimization algorithms is used to solve the optimization problem. The validation of the framework was performed by comparing the predicted and the measured operational variables. Simulation results show that optimized operation profiles lead to a significant decrease in operational costs and production times.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>High control bandwidth is usually restricted in a finite sampling rate of a charge-coupled device (CCD)-based tracking loop, which hinders a good closed-loop performance. Conventionally, a rate feedforward controller is usually used to improve the control performance; however, it is restricted by the line-of-sight (LOS) rate, which is required to be estimated due to only the LOS error available in the CCD-based tracking control system. Besides that, it is also affected by the inverse of the control model. A new error-based feedforward (EBF) control mode is proposed to overcome these difficulties. Due to being plugged into an existing feedback control loop, the closed-loop performance of the CCD-based control system can be minimized by optimizing a Q-filter. The closed-loop stability and robustness with this EBF control system are investigated on the condition of the gain margin and the phase margin of the open-loop transfer function. Furthermore, this paper proposes a new criterion to enhance the robustness of the EBF control system and reveals the sensitivity function property. Because of not being restricted by an accurate model, this new feedforward controller cannot lead to a compromise between error attenuation and noise propagation in the control loop. Simulations and experiments are both used to testify the effectiveness of the improved control mode.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We consider the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging of an object using the light reflected off a diffusive wall. The wall scatters incident light such that a lens is no longer useful to form an image. Instead, we exploit the 4D spatial coherence function to reconstruct a 2D projection of the obscured object. The approach is completely passive in the sense that no control over the light illuminating the object is assumed and is compatible with the partially coherent fields ubiquitous in both the indoor and outdoor environments. We formulate a multi-criteria convex optimization problem for reconstruction, which fuses the reflected field&#x2019;s intensity and spatial coherence information at different scales. Our formulation leverages established optics models of light propagation and scattering and exploits the sparsity common to many images in different bases. We also develop an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers to efficiently solve the convex program proposed. A means for analyzing the null space of the measurement matrices is provided as well as a means for weighting the contribution of individual measurements to the reconstruction. This paper holds promise to advance passive imaging in the challenging NLOS regimes in which the intensity does not necessarily retain distinguishable features and provides a framework for multi-modal information fusion for efficient scene reconstruction.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Intensity-based image registration approaches rely on similarity measures to guide the search for geometric correspondences with the high affinity between images. The properties of the used measures are vital for the robustness and accuracy of the registration. In this paper, a symmetric, intensity interpolation-free, affine registration framework based on a combination of intensity and spatial information is proposed. The excellent performance of the framework is demonstrated on a combination of synthetic tests, recovering known transformations in the presence of noise, and real applications in biomedical and medical image registration, for both 2D and 3D images. The method exhibits greater robustness and higher accuracy than similarity measures in common use, when inserted into a standard gradient-based registration framework available as part of the open source Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit. The method is also empirically shown to have a low computational cost, making it practical for real applications. The source code is available.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The de facto algorithm for facial landmark estimation involves running a face detector with a subsequent deformable model fitting on the bounding box. This encompasses two basic problems: 1) the detection and deformable fitting steps are performed independently, while the detector might not provide the best-suited initialization for the fitting step, and 2) the face appearance varies hugely across different poses, which makes the deformable face fitting very challenging and thus distinct models have to be used (e.g., one for profile and one for frontal faces). In this paper, we propose the first, to the best of our knowledge, joint multi-view convolutional network to handle large pose variations across faces in-the-wild, and elegantly bridge face detection and facial landmark localization tasks. The existing joint face detection and landmark localization methods focus only on a very small set of landmarks. By contrast, our method can detect and align a large number of landmarks for semi-frontal (68 landmarks) and profile (39 landmarks) faces. We evaluate our model on a plethora of datasets including the standard static image datasets such as IBUG, 300W, COFW, and the latest Menpo Benchmark for both semi-frontal and profile faces. A significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods on deformable face tracking is witnessed on the 300VW benchmark. We also demonstrate state-of-the-art results for face detection on FDDB and MALF datasets.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In order to improve the performance of fault isolation and diagnosis of principal component analysis (PCA) based methods, this article proposes a novel fault detection and isolation approach using the structured joint sparse PCA (SJSPCA). The objective function involves two regularization terms: the '2,1 norm and the graph Laplacian. By imposing the '2,1 norm, SJSPCA is able to achieve rowwise sparsity, and introducing the graph Laplacian term can incorporate structured variable correlation information. The row-sparsity property of '2,1 norm ensures that the score indices associated with normal variables approaching zero and the graph Laplacian constraint helps the isolation of correlated faulty variables. Once a fault is detected, a twostage fault-isolation strategy is considered and a score index is calculated for each variable. It is proved that the proposed two-stage strategy is capable of isolating faulty variables. The improved fault-isolation performance of SJSPCA is illustrated by a simulation example and a gas flow fault observed in an industrial blast furnace iron-making process.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Automated fault detection is an important part of a quality control system. It has the potential to increase the overall quality of monitored products and processes. The fault detection of automotive instrument cluster systems in computer-based manufacturing assembly lines is currently limited to simple boundary checking. The analysis of more complex nonlinear signals is performed manually by trained operators, whose knowledge is used to supervise quality checking and manual detection of faults. We present a novel approach for automated Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) based on deep learning. The approach was tested on data generated by computer-based manufacturing systems equipped with local and remote sensing devices. The results show that the approach models the different spatial/temporal patterns found in the data. The approach can successfully diagnose and locate multiple classes of faults under real-time working conditions. The proposed method is shown to outperform other established FDI methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents the topology, analysis, and control implementation of a new single-phase flexible power quality conditioner (FPQC), which can be used for handling voltage- and current-related power quality (PQ) problems. Different from other PQ-compensating devices, the FPQC can work under two compensating modes, i.e., parallel-connection mode (PCM) and series-connection mode (SCM). When the source voltage is unpolluted, the FPQC is working under the PCM so that the load harmonic current and reactive power can be compensated. When the source voltage is polluted, the FPQC is switched to the SCM to mitigate the impact caused by the polluted voltage. In this way, a desired voltage can be maintained at the load side to protect the critical load. The mode switching between PCM and SCM is realized by two relays. To ensure fast dynamics response and smooth transient operation, the model predictive control method is applied to regulate the developed FPQC. Both the simulation platform and laboratorial prototype are built to validate the effectiveness of the system. The simulation and experimental results are presented and discussed.

<p>We propose a quantitative analysis method using cell segmentation to evaluate the coating quality of anodic oxide. In order to identify each cell in a titania surface, a boundary region is adaptively detected according to the regional intensity distribution, and a boundary distance map is projected onto the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the titania surface. Each cell in the projected image is divided via clustering centered on the local maximum point. The uniformities of the cell distribution, size, and thickness are measured using the angle difference, size difference, and brightness difference between adjacent cells to comprehensively evaluate the quantitative alignment of the titania surface. The proposed method demonstrates the best performance in both cell detection and cell segmentation for SEM images of the titania surface compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The quantitative analysis of the anodic oxide film alignment was verified using color coding, histogram, and quantification of uniformity.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to the ever-increasing requirements of delay-sensitive and mission-critical applications in 5G, mobile edge computing is promising to react and support real-time interactive systems. However, it is still challenging to construct a 5G-enabled traffic management system, owing to the qualification of ultra-low latency and ubiquitous connectivity. Furthermore, the computing resources and storage capacities of edge nodes are limited, thus computation offloading is a fundamental issue for real-time traffic management. This paper puts forward a hybrid computation offloading framework for real-time traffic management in 5G networks. Specially, we consider both nonorthogonal-multiple-access-enabled and vehicle-to-vehicle-based traffic offloading. The investigated problem is formulated as a joint task distribution, subchannel assignment, and power allocation problem, with the objective of maximizing the sum offloading rate. After that, we prove its NP-hardness and decompose it into three subproblems, which can be solved iteratively. Performance evaluations illustrate the effectiveness of our framework.
