<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama">JAMA Current Issue</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p><span class="paragraphSection"><strong>In Reply</strong> Drs Slagt and van Eijk suggest that the ventilation protocol used in PReVENT, a randomized clinical trial comparing a low tidal volume ventilation strategy with an intermediate tidal volume strategy in critically ill patients without ARDS, was too complex, perhaps explaining why there was little difference in tidal volume between the 2 groups. Actually, the 2 ventilation protocols were simple and well understood and practiced by the caregivers in the participating centers. Volume-controlled ventilation and pressure support ventilation were the preferred modes of ventilation, but other modes could be used if deemed necessary by the attending physician, which happened in a minority of cases. In the low tidal volume group, the aim was to reach a tidal volume between 4 and 6 mL/kg PBW; however, this was not always possible, such as when the lowest allowed level of support (5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) was reached, when unacceptable hypercarbia developed, or when a patient became too dyspneic. In the intermediate tidal volume group, the aim was to reach a tidal volume between 8 and 10 mL/kg PBW; however, this also was not always possible, such as when the highest allowed airway pressure (25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) was reached. Additional use of sedation or muscle relaxants, with the purpose of allowing the assigned ventilation strategy, was not permitted. Of note, light sedation was practiced in all participating centers, resulting in early use of pressure support ventilation. This explains, at least in part, why tidal volume differences were less than differences in earlier studies that examined the effects of a low tidal volume strategy, including the pilot study for PReVENT.</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes two coupled-inductors-based Z-source networks, called the modified series and tapped switched-coupled-inductors quasi-Z-source networks (mSSCL-qZSN and mTSCL-qZSN, respectively). These networks offer high voltage gains with less-than-unity winding turn ratios $(n &lt; {text{1)}}$, resulting in a reduced inductive element size. Other advantages include a less number of active components and their lower ratings and a higher efficiency. In addition, a lower magnetic core size is required for the proposed ZSNs due to the lower peak magnetizing current. The performance principles and detailed comparative analysis are provided and confirmed through experiments on a 200-W dc&#x2013;dc converter.

<p>This paper provides robust $mathcal {H}_{infty }$ state feedback controllers suitable for implementation in three-phase grid-connected converters. This control strategy is known to provide optimal rejection of disturbances, but usually leads to high control gains, that may be difficult to be implemented in practice. To mitigate this problem, a linear matrix inequality condition based on slack variables is proposed, which allows to impose bounds on the control gains in a less conservative way than conventional quadratic stability. The performance is proven to be superior to similar $mathcal {H}_{infty }$ state feedback controllers in the literature, providing an upper bound for the converter output admittance and experimental grid currents complying with the IEEE Standard 1547.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Cogging torque, inherent in permanent magnet machines, is closely related to the airgap flux density harmonic contents. The third harmonic can be utilized in combination with the fundamental one to increase the average torque, whilst its relationship with cogging torque is uncertain. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of third harmonic in airgap flux density on cogging torque in surface-mounted permanent magnet (SPM) machines considering different slot&#x002f;pole (S&#x002f;P) combinations. First, based on the simplified expressions of cogging torque in machines with sinusoidal plus third harmonic (Sine&#x002b;3rd) airgap flux density, S&#x002f;P combinations are classified into four cases for discussion. It is found that when N<sub>s</sub> &#x002f;GCD (N<sub>s</sub>, N<sub>p</sub>) &#x2265; 4 (N<sub>s</sub>: slot number; N<sub>p</sub>: pole number; GCD: great common divisor), third harmonic in airgap flux density has no effect on cogging torque. Otherwise, cogging torque will be generated. Furthermore, two approaches for obtaining the Sine and Sine&#x002b;3rd airgap flux density, i.e., Sine&#x002f;Sine&#x002b;3rd h<sub>m</sub> and Sine&#x002f;Sine&#x002b;3rd B<sub>r</sub>, are validated, based on which finite-element analyses are carried out on four machines, i.e., 12-slot&#x002f;10-pole (12S12P), 12S6P, 12S8P, and 12S10P to verify the conclusion. Finally, the 12S8P and 12S10P Sine&#x002b;3rd SPM machines are prototyped and tested for validation.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Time delays exist in network-connected systems. Especially for vision-based multirobot systems, time delays are diverse and complicated due to the communication network, camera latency, image processing, etc. At the same time, many tasks, such as searching and rescue, have timing requirement. This paper focuses on fixed-time formation control of multirobot systems subject to delay constraints. First, predictor-based state transformation is employed for each robot to deal with the input delay, and the uncertain terms remained in the transformed systems are carefully considered. Then, a couple of nonlinear fixed-time formation protocols are proposed for the multirobot systems with respectively undirected and directed topology, and the corresponding settling time is derived by using the Lyapunov functions. In particular, the upper-bound estimation of the formation settling time is explicitly given irrelevant to the initial conditions. Finally, the protocols are validated through a numerical simulation example and then implemented on an E-puck robots platform. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation protocols.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a cost-effective and highly accurate resolver-to-digital conversion method is presented. The core of the idea is to apply a third-order rational fraction polynomial approximation for the conversion of sinusoidal signals into the pseudo linear signals, which are extended to the range 0&#x00b0;&#x2013;360&#x00b0; in four quadrants. Then, the polynomial least squares method is used to achieve compensation to acquire the final angles. The presented method shows better performance in terms of accuracy and rapidity compared with the commercial available techniques in simulation results. This paper describes the implementation details of the proposed method and the way to incorporate it in digital signal processor-based permanent magnet synchronous motor drive system. Experimental tests under different conditions are carried out to verify the effectiveness for the proposed method. The obtained maximum error is about 0.0014&#x00b0; over 0&#x00b0;&#x2013;360&#x00b0;, which can usually be ignored in most industrial applications.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Real-time multiple event analysis is important for reliable situational awareness and secure operation of the power system. Multiple sequential events can induce complex superimposed pattern in the data and are challenging to analyze in real time. This paper proposes a method for accurate detection, temporal localization, and classification of multiple events in real time using synchrophasor data. For detection and temporal localization, a Teager-Kaiser energy operator (TKEO) based method is proposed. For event classification, a time series classification based method using energy similarity measure (ESM) is proposed. The proposed method is tested for simulated multiple event cases in the IEEE-118 bus system using DigSilent/PowerFactory and real PMU data for the Indian grid.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we consider false data injection (FDI) attacks with limited information of transmission-line susceptances and new countermeasures in smart grids. First, we prove that the adversary could launch FDI attacks to modify the state variable on a bus or superbus only if he/she knows the susceptance of every transmission line that is incident to that bus or superbus. Based on this observation, we provide a new countermeasure against FDI attacks, i.e., to make the susceptances of n-1 interconnected transmission lines that cover all buses unknown to the adversary (e.g., by proactively perturbing transmission-line susceptances through distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) devices), where n is the total number of buses. This new countermeasure can work alone or in conjunction with traditional ones to reduce the number of meter measurements/state variables that are to be secured against FDI attacks. The implementation of FDI attacks with limited susceptance information and the effectiveness of new countermeasures are demonstrated by using an illustrative 4-bus power system and the IEEE 9-bus, 14-bus, 30-bus, 118-bus, and 300-bus test power systems.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The dual-drive H-gantry is widely used for high-speed, high-precision Cartesian motion. Compared with the conventional rigid-linked design, the flexure-linked counterpart is able to prevent the damage of joints for its smaller interaxial coupling force. However, there are still barriers to further push up its precision, such as parametric uncertainties due to the inaccurate dynamical model, the possible induced vibration during high-speed motion, and the decentralized control structure required by industries. To maintain the tracking precision of carriages and minimize the vibration of the end effector, we aim to optimize parameters in decentralized controllers with choices of flexure pieces. We find that such decentralized feedback structure yields some uncontrollable but stabilizable states in the closed-loop system, and no direct solution from solving the algebraic Riccati equation is available in this case. Such structural constraint, together with constraints due to stability requirement and model uncertainties facilitates us to formulate an H<sub>2</sub> guaranteed cost control problem within a projected convex domain. From here, efficient numerical procedures are developed to obtain the global optimum by iterative linear programming. The real-time experiment validates the optimality and the robustness of the proposed method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we optimize power and spectrum allocation simultaneously to improve the demand-side communication quality in smart grid, to further reduce the cost of utility companies. The electricity cost is first modeled based on regulation errors caused by direct load control in the smart grid. Then the subbands are allocated to different data aggregator units according to the band confidence levels and the utility company's maximum cost. An algorithm is designed to optimize transmission power of the relay and refine the spectrum allocation to reduce the cost of utility companies. Simulation results demonstrate that the packet loss rate and cost of utility companies can be significantly reduced.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as the most popular classification models in biometrics research. Under the discriminative paradigm of pattern recognition, CNNs are used typically in one of two ways: 1) verification mode (&#x201c; are samples from the same person? &#x201d;), where pairs of images are provided to the network to distinguish between genuine and impostor instances and 2) identification mode (&#x201c; whom is this sample from? &#x201d;), where appropriate feature representations that map images to identities are found. This paper postulates a novel mode for using CNNs in biometric identification, by learning models that answer the question &#x201c; is the query&#x2019;s identity among this set? &#x201d;. The insight is a reminiscence of the classical Mastermind game: by iteratively analyzing the network responses when multiple random samples of  $k$  gallery elements are compared to the query, we obtain weakly correlated matching scores that, altogether, provide solid cues to infer the most likely identity. In this setting, identification is regarded as a variable selection and regularization problem, with sparse linear regression techniques being used to infer the matching probability with respect to each gallery identity. As main strength, this strategy is highly robust to outlier matching scores, which are known to be a primary error source in biometric recognition. Our experiments were carried out in full versions of two well-known irises near-infrared (CASIA-IrisV4-Thousand) and periocular visible wavelength (UBIRIS.v2) datasets, and confirm that recognition performance can be solidly boosted-up by the proposed algorithm, when c-
mpared with the traditional working modes of CNNs in biometrics.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In real-world applications, different kinds of learning and prediction errors are likely to incur different costs for the same system. Moreover, in practice, the cost label information is often available only for a few training samples. In a semi-supervised setting, label propagation is critical to infer the cost information for unlabeled training data. The existing methods typically conduct label propagation independently ahead of supervised cost-sensitive learning. The precomputed label information is kept fixed, which may become suboptimal in the subsequent learning process and hence degrade the overall system performance. In this paper, we develop a unified cost-sensitive framework for semi-supervised face recognition that can jointly optimize the inferred label information and the classifier in an iterative manner. Our experiments on face benchmark datasets demonstrate that in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods for label propagation and cost-sensitive learning, the proposed approach can significantly improve the overall system performance, especially in terms of classification errors associated with high costs.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Digital reconstruction of mechanically shredded documents has received increasing attention in the last years mainly for historical and forensics needs. Computational methods to solve this problem are highly desirable in order to mitigate the time-consuming human effort and to preserve document integrity. The reconstruction of strips-shredded documents is accomplished by horizontally splicing pieces so that the arising sequence (solution) is as similar as the original document. In this context, a central issue is the quantification of the fitting between the pieces (strips), which generally involves stating a function that associates a pair of strips to a real value indicating the fitting quality. This problem is also more challenging for text documents, such as business letters or legal documents, since they depict poor color information. The system proposed here addresses this issue by exploring character shapes as visual features for compatibility computation. Experiments conducted with real mechanically shredded documents showed that our approach outperformed in accuracy other popular techniques in the literature considering documents with (almost) only textual content.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Efficient security patch distribution is of essential importance for updating anti-virus software to ensure effective and timely virus detection and cleanup. In this paper, we propose a mixed strategy of patch distribution to combine the advantages of the traditional centralized patch distribution strategy and decentralized patch distribution strategy. A novel network model that contains a central node and a multiplex network composed of patch dissemination network layer and virus propagation network layer is presented, and a competing spreading dynamical process on top of the network model that simulates the interplay between virus propagation and patch dissemination is developed. Such a new framework helps in effectively analyzing the impacts of patches distribution on virus propagation, and developing more realizable schemes for restraining virus propagation. Furthermore, considering the constraints of the capacity of the central node and the bandwidth of network links, an optimal allocation approach of patches is proposed, which could simultaneously optimize multiple dynamical parameters to effectively restrain the virus propagation with a given budget.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The connected vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) and cloud computing technology allows entities in VANET to enjoy the advantageous storage and computing services offered by some cloud service provider. However, the advantages do not come free, since their combination brings many new security and privacy requirements for VANET applications. In this paper, we investigate the cloud-based road condition monitoring (RCoM) scenario, where the authority needs to monitor real-time road conditions with the help of a cloud server so that it could make sound responses to emergency cases timely. When some bad road condition is detected, e.g., some geologic hazard or accident happens, vehicles on site are able to report such information to a cloud server engaged by the authority. We focus on addressing three key issues in RCoM. First, the vehicles have to be authorized by some roadside unit before generating a road condition report in the domain and uploading it to the cloud server. Second, to guarantee the privacy against the cloud server, the road condition information should be reported in ciphertext format, which requires that the cloud server should be able to distinguish the reported data from different vehicles in ciphertext format for the same place without compromising their confidentiality. Third, the cloud server and authority should be able to validate the report source, i.e., to check whether the road conditions are reported by legitimate vehicles. To address these issues, we present an efficient RCoM scheme, analyze its efficiency theoretically, and demonstrate the practicality through experiments.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Video summarization is a challenging task, mainly due to the difficulties in learning complicated semantic structural relations between videos and summaries. In this paper, we present a novel supervised video summarization scheme based on three-stage deep neural networks. The scheme takes a divide-and-conquer strategy to resolve the complicated task of 3D video summarization into a set of easy and flexible computational subtasks, and then to sequentially perform 2D CNNs, 1D CNNs, and long short-term memory to address the subtasks in an hierarchical fashion. The hierarchical modeling of spatio&#x2013;temporal structure leads to high performance and efficiency. In addition, we propose a simple but effective user-ranking method to cope with the labeling subjectivity problem of user-created video summarization, leading to the labeling quality refinement for robust supervised learning. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art video summarization methods on two benchmark datasets.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fractional-pel accurate motion is widely used in video coding. For subband coding, fractional-pel accuracy is challenging since it is difficult to handle the complex motion field with temporal transforms. In our previous work, we designed integer accurate motion-adaptive transforms (MAT) which can transform integer accurate motion-connected coefficients. In this paper, we extend the integer MAT to fractional-pel accuracy. The integer MAT allows only one reference coefficient to be the lowband coefficient. In this paper, we design the transform such that it permits multiple references and generates multiple lowband coefficients. In addition, our fractional-pel MAT can incorporate a general interpolation filter into the basis vector, such that the highband coefficient produced by the transform is the same as the prediction error from the interpolation filter. The fractional-pel MAT is always orthonormal. Thus, the energy is preserved by the transform. We compare the proposed fractional-pel MAT, the integer MAT, and the half-pel motion-compensated orthogonal transform (MCOT), while HEVC intra coding is used to encode the temporal subbands. The experimental results show that the proposed fractional-pel MAT outperforms the integer MAT and the half-pel MCOT. The gain achieved by the proposed MAT over the integer MAT can reach up to 1 dB in PSNR.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We present an image captioning framework that generates captions under a given topic. The topic candidates are extracted from the caption corpus. A given image&#x2019;s topics are then selected from these candidates by a CNN-based multi-label classifier. The input to the caption generation model is an image-topic pair, and the output is a caption of the image. For this purpose, a cross-modal embedding method is learned for the images, topics, and captions. In the proposed framework, the topic, caption, and image are organized in a hierarchical structure, which is preserved in the embedding space by using the order-embedding method. The caption embedding is upper bounded by the corresponding image embedding and lower bounded by the topic embedding. The lower bound pushes the images and captions about the same topic closer together in the embedding space. A bidirectional caption-image retrieval task is conducted on the learned embedding space and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the embedding method. To generate a caption for an image, an embedding vector is sampled from the region bounded by the embeddings of the image and the topic, then a language model decodes it to a sentence as the output. The lower bound set by the topic shrinks the output space of the language model, which may help the model to learn to match images and captions better. Experiments on the image captioning task on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets validate the usefulness of this framework by showing that the different given topics can lead to different captions describing specific aspects of the given image and that the quality of generated captions is higher than the control model without a topic as input. In addition, the proposed method is competitive with many state-of-the-art methods in terms of standard evaluation metrics.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Hypergraph learning has been widely exploited in various image processing applications, due to its advantages in modeling the high-order information. Its efficacy highly depends on building an informative hypergraph structure to accurately and robustly formulate the underlying data correlation. However, the existing hypergraph learning methods are sensitive to non-Gaussian noise, which hurts the corresponding performance. In this paper, we present a noise-resistant hypergraph learning model, which provides superior robustness against various non-Gaussian noises. In particular, our model adopts low-rank representation to construct a hypergraph, which captures the globally linear data structure as well as preserving the grouping effect of highly correlated data. We further introduce a correntropy-induced local metric to measure the reconstruction errors, which is particularly robust to non-Gaussian noises. Finally, the Frobenious-norm-based regularization is proposed to combine with the low-rank regularizer, which enables our model to regularize the singular values of the coefficient matrix. By such, the non-zero coefficients are selected to generate a hyperedge set as well as the hyperedge weights. We have evaluated the proposed hypergraph model in the tasks of image clustering and semi-supervised image classification. Quantitatively, our scheme significantly enhances the performance of the state-of-the-art hypergraph models on several benchmark data sets.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose a Group-Sparse Representation-based method with applications to Face Recognition (GSR-FR). The novel sparse representation variational model includes a non-convex sparsity-inducing penalty and a robust non-convex loss function. The penalty encourages group sparsity by using an approximation of the  $ell _{0}$ -quasinorm, and the loss function is chosen to make the algorithm robust to noise, occlusions, and disguises. The solution of the non-trivial non-convex optimization problem is efficiently obtained by a majorization-minimization strategy combined with forward-backward splitting, which, in particular, reduces the solution to a sequence of easier convex optimization sub-problems. Extensive experiments on widely used face databases show the potentiality of the proposed model and demonstrate that the GSR-FR algorithm is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods based on sparse representation, especially for very low dimensional feature spaces.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a stochastic representation of maximized mutual information analysis (MIA) method for quality monitoring in which a manner of imposing prior probability distributions over projection parameters is employed and subsequently, a Bayesian estimation algorithm is put forward for projection learning. The proposed stochastic MIA (SMIA) based approach allows the enhanced performance of fault detection due to the following advantages over classic monitoring methods. First, the SMIA approach utilizes the mechanism of hierarchical priors and an individual prior over each projection direction, as a key feature of the proposed method, which enables SMIA to build a sparse model that can discard irrelevant components in the process data with respect to the prediction of quality variables. Second, the proposed SMIA method incorporates the advantage of maximizing mutual information on the minimum achievable error of model prediction as well as the advantage of describing the serial dynamics. Additionally, the optimal dimensionality of the latent space in an SMIA can be automatically determined during the procedure of Bayesian estimation by the utilization of these adaptive priors over projections. The effectiveness of the proposed approach for quality monitoring is demonstrated on the benchmark of Tennessee Eastman process.
