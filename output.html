<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the rapid growth of financial services, fraud detection has been a very
important problem to guarantee a healthy environment for both users and
providers. Conventional solutions for fraud detection mainly use some
rule-based methods or distract some features manually to perform prediction.
However, in financial services, users have rich interactions and they
themselves always show multifaceted information. These data form a large
multiview network, which is not fully exploited by conventional methods.
Additionally, among the network, only very few of the users are labelled, which
also poses a great challenge for only utilizing labeled data to achieve a
satisfied performance on fraud detection.
</p>
<p>To address the problem, we expand the labeled data through their social
relations to get the unlabeled data and propose a semi-supervised attentive
graph neural network, namedSemiGNN to utilize the multi-view labeled and
unlabeled data for fraud detection. Moreover, we propose a hierarchical
attention mechanism to better correlate different neighbors and different
views. Simultaneously, the attention mechanism can make the model interpretable
and tell what are the important factors for the fraud and why the users are
predicted as fraud. Experimentally, we conduct the prediction task on the users
of Alipay, one of the largest third-party online and offline cashless payment
platform serving more than 4 hundreds of million users in China. By utilizing
the social relations and the user attributes, our method can achieve a better
accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods on two tasks. Moreover, the
interpretable results also give interesting intuitions regarding the tasks.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>High-performance Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed in
many real-world applications e.g., cloud prediction APIs. Recent advances in
model functionality stealing attacks via black-box access (i.e., inputs in,
predictions out) threaten the business model of such applications, which
require a lot of time, money, and effort to develop. Existing defenses take a
passive role against stealing attacks, such as by truncating predicted
information. We find such passive defenses ineffective against DNN stealing
attacks. In this paper, we propose the first defense which actively perturbs
predictions targeted at poisoning the training objective of the attacker. We
find our defense effective across a wide range of challenging datasets and DNN
model stealing attacks, and additionally outperforms existing defenses. Our
defense is the first that can withstand highly accurate model stealing attacks
for tens of thousands of queries, amplifying the attacker's error rate up to a
factor of 85$\times$ with minimal impact on the utility for benign users.

<p>Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) are devices that exploit small
variations in a manufacturing process to create unique and stable identifying
characteristics with applications ranging from intellectual property protection
and device authentication to secret key exchange. In this work, we present a
novel PUF design composed of a chaotic Boolean network implemented on a
field-programmable gate array, capable of generating challenge-response pairs
in as little as 10 ns. In contrast to other designs, we collect multiple
response bits per challenge, and demonstrate an exponential scaling of entropy
with network size. We find a high degree of uniqueness and reliability from the
design, respectively characterized by $\mu_{inter}$ = 0.41 $\pm$ 0.02 and
$\mu_{intra}$ = 0.02 $\pm$ 0.01 for a 256-node network. We further show that
the network is chaotic and resistant to a third-party machine learning attack,
while exhibiting moderate temperature variation, potentially paving the way for
commercial use.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant performance in various
tasks. However, recent studies have shown that DNNs can be easily fooled by
small perturbation on the input, called adversarial attacks. As the extensions
of DNNs to graphs, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been demonstrated to
inherit this vulnerability. Adversary can mislead GNNs to give wrong
predictions by modifying the graph structure such as manipulating a few edges.
This vulnerability has arisen tremendous concerns for adapting GNNs in
safety-critical applications and has attracted increasing research attention in
recent years. Thus, it is necessary and timely to provide a comprehensive
overview of existing graph adversarial attacks and the countermeasures. In this
survey, we categorize existing attacks and defenses, and review the
corresponding state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we have developed a
repository with representative algorithms
(https://github.com/DSE-MSU/DeepRobust/tree/master/deeprobust/graph). The
repository enables us to conduct empirical studies to deepen our understandings
on attacks and defenses on graphs.

<p>A poison is a substance, which when taken into the system is either absorbed or by its thermal action on the parts with which it is in contact produces deleterious effects. It may seem strange that almost all toxics are innocent, until they reach the circulation of the blood. Their slow or rapid absorption largely determines their deleterious effects upon the system. In our observations we are reminded from time to time of the idiosyncrasies of individuals and we seldom inquire into the causes of these peculiar conditions. It is generally attributed to a perversion of the nervous system, but in truth is caused by a rapid absorption of the poison and is modified by the power of resistance inherent in the individual. Hereditary predispositions and peculiar cachexias in persons are dissimilar conditions, and are in no sense identical. Heredity has not been defined satisfactorily, but the conditions of progenitors are transmitted in an attenuated form, which underlies their maladies.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Wide area measurement system (WAMS) infrastructure is one of the most significant elements of the smart grid that measures, collects, and analyzes data in the power system. Fundamental components of the WAMS are phasor measurement units (PMUs), phasor data concentrators (PDCs), and its relevant applications. The PDC collects data from several different PMUs, integrates data and sends it to the control center. In order to achieve a stable implementation of WAMS, the communication structure should be reliable and meets the quality of service (QoS) requirements for various applications in the network. In this paper, we propose a novel WAMS communication infrastructure by utilizing the software-defined networking technology, which can enhance the reliability of the corresponding networks. In the proposed model, in order to meet the applications QoS needs, the traffic flows are categorized into different class of services, and then by applying a QoS mechanism, along with a content-aware queuing algorithm, the maximum capacity for the critical traffic is obtained. This provides a low latency for critical WAMS applications. The proposed model has been implemented in the Mininet environment using the Ryu controller. The implementation results indicate that the proposed infrastructure reduces end-to-end delay and packets loss and utilizes the network resources optimally.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Traditional offline programming or teach pendant-based methods limit the collaboration capabilities of users and robots to cope with complex and changing industrial tasks. To address efficient robot manipulation in high-mix and low-volume tasks, especially for skillful tasks involving both trajectory and force control requirements, fast robot teaching and skill transferability are critical. Compared to manually dragging a heavy robot, or programming a trajectory by complex calculations, we believe that robots can efficiently learn skills from direct teaching through telemanipulation, and improve the skills based on optimization with sensory feedback. In aerospace engine, maintenance, repair, and operations, the surfaces of aerospace components are required to be masked by tapes. We propose a fast and intuitive telemanipulation-based method to teach a robot these masking skills and compare the performance of the proposed method with teach pendant&#x2013;based methods among several users. This study aims to prove the efficiency and intuitiveness of the telemanipulation-based method proposed herein for enabling a robot to learn skillful and complex manipulation tasks.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>It is notable that localization accuracy using received signal strength (RSS) fingerprints solely is very vulnerable to dynamic environments. Utilizing multiple fingerprints gleaned from RSS for localization is a propitious strategy to overcome the RSS susceptibility. Brimful utilization via fusing multiple fingerprint functions which supplement each other are not harnessed by existing fusion-based techniques, resulting in low localization accuracy. This paper presents a novel and robust WiFi localization modus operandi by fusing DerIvative Fingerprints of RSS with MultIple Classifiers (DIFMIC). DIFMIC first constructs a multiple fingerprints group by gleaning hyperbolic location fingerprint (HLF) and signal strength differences fingerprint (DIFF) from RSS fingerprints. Then, it obtains Multiple Fingerprints Trained Classifiers (MFTCs) via training each basic classifier with each fingerprint. To fully leverage the inherent supplementation among fingerprints and classifiers, a two-layer fusion profile (weights) joint optimization algorithm with multiple constraints is proposed. We also propose a Fusion Profile Selection (FPS) algorithm to intelligently choose fusion weights from the two-layer fusion profile for a more accurate localization. DIFMIC shows more leverage in combining multiple information, thus exhibiting better robustness in WiFi positioning. Results from our experiments reflect that DIFMIC performs better than other existing methods in real environments.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Individually reinforcing the robustness of a single deep learning model only gives limited security guarantees especially when facing adversarial examples. In this article, we propose DeSVig, a decentralized swift vigilance framework to identify adversarial attacks in an industrial artificial intelligence systems (IAISs), which enables IAISs to correct the mistake in a few seconds. The DeSVig is highly decentralized, which improves the effectiveness of recognizing abnormal inputs. We try to overcome the challenges on ultralow latency caused by dynamics in industries using peculiarly designated mobile edge computing and generative adversarial networks. The most important advantage of our work is that it can significantly reduce the failure risks of being deceived by adversarial examples, which is critical for safety-prioritized and delay-sensitive environments. In our experiments, adversarial examples of industrial electronic components are generated by several classical attacking models. Experimental results demonstrate that the DeSVig is more robust, efficient, and scalable than some state-of-art defenses.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This article proposes a charging management of electric vehicles (EVs) with a newly presented EV social contribution. The EV charging problem is represented by a generalized Nash equilibrium game where each individual EV tries to minimize its charging cost while satisfying its own charging requirements and respecting the charging facility constraints. The individual EV features a social behavior to potentially contribute in shifting its charging schedule from specific intervals that have insufficient charging power. This shift in the EV schedule will allow more charging power to other EVs that admit stricter charging requirements, i.e., intervals and demands. In this way, the contributed EVs socially help others in reducing their charging costs, which is particularly important during the overload cases in the system. The proposed solution is reached iteratively in a distributed way utilizing the consensus network and found based on the receding horizon optimization framework. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed social contribution in the charging management for reducing the charging cost of EVs.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Energy storage units (such as battery or ultracapacitor) can help to reduce the power fluctuation in the impedance source network converter applications such as the photovoltaic (PV) and fuel cells systems. Due to the unknown dynamic characteristics of the energy stored impedance network, the unexpected oscillation and inrush currents in dynamic process might threaten the storage device safety. In this article, an energy stored quasi-Z-source converter with the battery is modeled and analyzed including the transient capacitor current. The impact of the network internal resonance on the battery current control loop is mathematically explored. The resulted conflict between the zero steady-state error and bandwidth requirement is revealed. That yields the sacrifice and limitation of the closed-loop dynamic performance in the conventional methods. An active damping technique is then proposed to ensure the extended bandwidth and better dynamic performances under different state of charge (SOC) occasions. The theoretical analysis and performance are both verified by the simulations and experiments.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Current flow controllers (CFCs) are power electronics-based devices that may remove some technical barriers preventing multiterminal high-voltage direct current (MTdc) grid deployment. In this paper, an interline CFC topology is investigated. The single H-bridge CFC (1B-CFC) alters the grid power flow by transferring power between neighboring dc lines. The operation and control of a 1B-CFC under a single modulation scheme is presented. A control strategy has been proposed to provide pole balancing support during imbalance conditions. Small-scale prototypes have been developed to demonstrate the functionality and operational range of the device. To this end, an experimental MTdc grid test-rig has been employed. It is shown that a 1B-CFC could be used to limit the dc line current and, additionally, it can be employed to enable asymmetrical tapping of dc lines. For completeness, the performance of the device has been experimentally validated under line overloading, pole imbalance conditions, and a pole-to-pole dc fault.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper introduces the bridgeless triple-mode resonant ac&#x2013;dc converter and presents its dynamic model and control technique. The proposed converter operates in triple mode: discontinuous-conduction mode (DCM), continuous-conduction mode (CCM), and missing resonance mode (MRM). It has the advantages of small number of required components, medium power capacity, and high efficiency, but it is difficult to control because DCM, CCM, and MRM have their own dynamic characteristics. To solve this control problem, the mode boundaries are first identified and, corresponding to each mode, the dynamic model is developed to design the controller. In each mode, we propose to add a repetitive controller (RC) with a phase-lead compensator to the conventional duty ratio plus feedback controller. The RC is used to suppress the deterministic periodic disturbances and the phase-lead compensator is used to compensate for the incurred phase lag. A 1-kW digitally controlled converter prototype is built and used to demonstrate the validity of the proposed modeling and control approach.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This article presents a sequential fusion approach for state estimation of networked multisensor nonlinear systems, where sensors and estimators are allowed to work asynchronously. Both sequential measurement fusion (SMF) and sequential state fusion (SSF) estimators are designed, where the unscented filtering method is used in the design of the local SMF estimator, and the matrix weighting method is applied in the design of the SSF estimator. It is shown that the proposed SSF estimators provide a satisfactory estimation precision that is close to the centralized batch state fusion (BSF) estimator, while requiring smaller computation burden as compared with the BSF estimator. Both simulations and experiments of a moving target tracking system are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed sequential fusion methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fault diagnosis, which identifies the root cause of the observed out-of-control status, is essential to counteracting or eliminating faults in industrial processes. Many conventional data-driven fault diagnosis methods ignore the fault tendency of abnormal samples, and they need a complete retraining process to include the newly collected abnormal samples or fault classes. In this article, a broad convolutional neural network (BCNN) is designed with incremental learning capability for solving the aforementioned issues. The proposed method combines several consecutive samples as a data matrix, and it then extracts both fault tendency and nonlinear structure from the obtained data matrix by using convolutional operation. After that, the weights in fully connected layers can be trained based on the obtained features and their corresponding fault labels. Because of the architecture of this network, the diagnosis performance of the BCNN model can be improved by adding newly generated additional features. Finally, the incremental learning capability of the proposed method is also designed, so that the BCNN model can update itself to include new coming abnormal samples and fault classes. The proposed method is applied both to a simulated process and a real industrial process. Experimental results illustrate that it can better capture the characteristics of the fault process, and effectively update diagnosis model to include new coming abnormal samples, and fault classes.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We present a feature-based image registration method, the stepwise image registration (SIR), with a closed-form solution. Our SIR creates an inlier pool and a candidate pool as the initialization, and then gradually enriches the inlier pool and refines the transformation. In each step, the enriched correspondence exclusively tunes the transformation coefficient within the confirmed inlier pairs, instead of updating the mapping using the complete putative set. In turn, the refined transformation prunes inconsistent mismatches to alleviate the incoming matching ambiguity. The context-aware locality measure (CALM) is designed for dissimilarity measure. The capability of the CALM can be enhanced by the progressive inlier pool enrichment. Finally, a retrieval process is performed based on the finest CALM and alignment, by which the inlier pool is maximized. Extensive experiments of enrichment evaluation, feature matching, image registration, and image retrieval demonstrate the favorable performance of our SIR against state-of-the-art methods. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/sucv/SIR.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>People constantly share their photographs with others through various social media sites. With the aid of the privacy settings provided by social media sites, image owners can designate scope of sharing, e.g., close friends and acquaintances. However, even if the owner of a photograph carefully sets the privacy setting to exclude a given individual who is not supposed to see the photograph, the photograph may still eventually reach a wider audience, including those clearly undesired through unanticipated channels of disclosure, causing a privacy breach. Moreover, it is often the case that a given image involves multiple stakeholders who are also depicted in the photograph. Due to various personalities, it is even more challenging to reach agreement on the privacy settings for these multi-owner photographs. In this paper, we propose a privacy risk reminder system, called REMIND, which estimates the probability that a shared photograph may be seen by unwanted people-through the social graph-who are not included in the original sharing list. We tackle this problem from a novel angle by digging into the big data regarding image sharing history. Specifically, the social media providers possess a huge amount of image sharing information (e.g., what photographs are shared with whom) of their users. By analyzing and modeling such rich information, we build a sophisticated probability model that efficiently aggregates the image disclosure probabilities along different possible image propagation chains and loops. If the computed disclosure probability indicates high risks of privacy breach, a reminder is issued to the image owner to help revise the privacy settings (or, at least, inform the user about this accidental disclosure risk). The proposed REMIND system also has a nice feature of policy harmonization that helps resolve privacy differences in multi-owner photographs. We have carried out a user study to validate the rationale of our proposed solutions and also conducte-
 experimental studies to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed REMIND system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The side-channel leakage is a consequence of program execution in a computer processor, and understanding relationship between code execution and information leakage is a necessary step in estimating information leakage and its capacity limits. This paper proposes a methodology to relate program execution to electromagnetic side-channel emanations and estimates side-channel information capacity created by execution of series of instructions (e.g., a function, a procedure, or a program) in a processor. To model dependence among program instructions in a code, we propose to use Markov source model, which includes the dependencies among sequence of instructions as well as dependencies among instructions as they pass through a pipeline of the processor. The emitted electromagnetic (EM) signals during instruction executions are natural choice for the inputs into the model. To obtain the channel inputs for the proposed model, we derive a mathematical relationship between the emanated instruction signal power (ESP) and total emanated signal power while running a program. Then, we derive the leakage capacity of EM side channels created by execution of series of instructions in a processor. Finally, we provide experimental results to demonstrate that leakages could be severe and that a dedicated attacker could obtain important information.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

<p>Online romance scams are a prevalent form of mass-marketing fraud in the West, and yet few studies have presented data-driven responses to this problem. In this type of scam, fraudsters craft fake profiles and manually interact with their victims. Because of the characteristics of this type of fraud and how dating sites operate, traditional detection methods (e.g., those used in spam filtering) are ineffective. In this paper, we investigate the archetype of online dating profiles used in this form of fraud, including their use of demographics, profile descriptions, and images, shedding light on both the strategies deployed by scammers to appeal to victims and the traits of victims themselves. Furthermore, in response to the severe financial and psychological harm caused by dating fraud, we develop a system to detect romance scammers on online dating platforms. This paper presents the first fully described system for automatically detecting this fraud. Our aim is to provide an early detection system to stop romance scammers as they create fraudulent profiles or before they engage with potential victims. Previous research has indicated that the victims of romance scams score highly on scales for idealized romantic beliefs. We combine a range of structured, unstructured, and deep-learned features that capture these beliefs in order to build a detection system. Our ensemble machine-learning approach is robust to the omission of profile details and performs at high accuracy (97%) in a hold-out validation set. The system enables development of automated tools for dating site providers and individual users.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We investigate the effect of outdated channel state information (CSI) on the secrecy performance of wireless-powered untrusted relay networks, in which the relay is a potential eavesdropper. To keep the information secret from this untrusted relay, the destination sends a jamming signal to the relay when the source transmits an information signal. At the same time, the relay harvests energy from the radio-frequency power, and forwards the received signals to the destination using this harvested energy. To determine the proportions of energy harvesting and information processing, the relay makes use of relaying based on power splitting or time switching policy. Although the destination tries to remove the jamming signal from the relaying signal, it cannot cancel out the jamming signal perfectly due to imperfect channel reciprocity caused by the outdated CSI; this residual jamming signal therefore has a negative impact on secrecy performance. In this scenario, we derive the closed-form expressions for the outage probability and average secrecy rate, and find the jamming power ratio, power splitting ratio, and time switching ratio to optimize these secrecy performance metrics. The numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of our analysis, and show that the proposed secure relaying protocols achieve a near-optimal secrecy performance, as well as outperforming the conventional scheme without the jamming power control.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Benefiting from the quick development of deep convolutional neural networks, especially fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), remarkable progresses have been achieved on salient object detection recently. Nevertheless, these FCNs based methods are still challenging to generate high resolution saliency maps, and also not applicable for subsequent applications due to their heavy model weights. In this paper, we propose a compact and efficient deep network with high accuracy for salient object detection. Firstly, we propose two strategies for initial prediction, one is a new designed multi-scale context module, the other is incorporating hand-crafted saliency priors. Secondly, we employ residual learning to refine it progressively by only learning the residual in each side-output, which can be achieved with few convolutional parameters, therefore leads to high compactness and high efficiency. Finally, we further design a novel top-down reverse attention block to guide the above side-output residual learning. Specifically, the current predicted salient regions are used to erase its side-output feature, thus the missing object parts and details can be efficiently learned from these unerased regions, which results in more complete detection and high accuracy. Extensive experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed network performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches, and shows advantages in simplicity, compactness and efficiency.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Seismic image interpolation is a currently popular research subject in modern reflection seismology. The interpolation problem is generally treated as a process of inversion. Under the compressed sensing framework, various sparse transformations and low-rank constraints based methods have great performances in recovering irregularly missing traces. However, in the case of regularly missing traces, their applications are limited because of the strong spatial aliasing energies. In addition, the erratic noise always poses a serious impact on the interpolation results obtained by the sparse transformations and low-rank constraints-based methods,. This is because the erratic noise is far from satisfying the statistical assumption behind these methods. In this study, we propose a mathematical morphology-based interpolation technique, which constrains the morphological scale of the model in the inversion process. The inversion problem is solved by the shaping regularization approach. The mathematical morphological constraint (MMC)-based interpolation technique has a satisfactory robustness to the spatial aliasing and erratic energies. We provide a detailed algorithmic framework and discuss the extension from 2D to higher dimensional version and the back operator in the shaping inversion. A group of numerical examples demonstrates the successful performance of the proposed technique.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The human visual system tends to consider saliency of an object as a whole. Some object-level saliency detection methods have been proposed by leveraging object proposals in bounding boxes, and regarding the entire bounding box as one candidate salient region. However, the bounding boxes can not provide exact object position and a lot of pixels in bounding boxes belong to the background. Consequently, background pixels in bounding box also show high saliency. Besides, acquiring object proposals needs high time cost. In order to compute object-level saliency, we consider region growing from some seed superpixels, to find one surrounding region which probably represents the whole object. The desired surrounding region has similar appearance inside and obvious difference with the outside, which is proposed as maximally stable region (MSR) in this paper. In addition, one effective seed superpixel selection strategy is presented to improve speed. MSR based saliency detection is more robust than pixel or superpixel level methods and object proposal based methods. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods at 50 FPS. Compared with deep learning based methods, we show worse performance, but with about 1200-1600 times faster, which means better trade-off between performance and speed.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we develop a concise but efficient network architecture called linear compressing based skip-connecting network (LCSCNet) for image super-resolution. Compared with two representative network architectures with skip connections, ResNet and DenseNet, a linear compressing layer is designed in LCSCNet for skip connection, which connects former feature maps and distinguishes them from newly-explored feature maps. In this way, the proposed LCSCNet enjoys the merits of the distinguish feature treatment of DenseNet and the parameter-economic form of ResNet. Moreover, to better exploit hierarchical information from both low and high levels of various receptive fields in deep models, inspired by gate units in LSTM, we also propose an adaptive element-wise fusion strategy with multi-supervised training. Experimental results in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms validate the effectiveness of LCSCNet.
