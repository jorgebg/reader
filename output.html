<p>Standard security protocols like SSL, TLS, IPSec etc. have high memory and
processor consumption which makes all these security protocols unsuitable for
resource constrained platforms such as Internet of Things (IoT). Blockchain
(BC) finds its efficient application in IoT platform to preserve the five basic
cryptographic primitives, such as confidentiality, authenticity, integrity,
availability and non-repudiation. Conventional adoption of BC in IoT platform
causes high energy consumption, delay and computational overhead which are not
appropriate for various resource constrained IoT devices. This work proposes a
machine learning (ML) based smart access control framework in a public and a
private BC for a smart city application which makes it more efficient as
compared to the existing IoT applications. The proposed IoT based smart city
architecture adopts BC technology for preserving all the cryptographic security
and privacy issues. Moreover, BC has very minimal overhead on IoT platform as
well. This work investigates the existing threat models and critical access
control issues which handle multiple permissions of various nodes and detects
relevant inconsistencies to notify the corresponding nodes. Comparison in terms
of all security issues with existing literature shows that the proposed
architecture is competitively efficient in terms of security access control.

<p>It is an ordinary day working from home, and you are part of a team that
regularly interacts over email. Since this is your main line of communication,
the company trained you to spot phishing emails. You've learned to skip over
emails that exhibit obvious phishing red flags: suspicious links, attachments,
grammar errors, etc. You just received an email from your boss about a major
project on which you play a critical role. The email is more demanding than
usual, even impolite. Your boss has generally seemed more upset with you
lately, so you approach them to express your concerns and clear the air. Your
boss is not receptive to your feedback. This causes a rift that impacts your
working relationship, compromising the effectiveness and productivity of the
entire team. You have been a victim of an Ambient Tactical Deception (ATD)
attack. We developed and tested a proof-of-concept social engineering attack
targeting web-based email users. The attack is executed through a malicious
browser extension that acts as a man-in-the-middle and reformats the textual
content to alter the emotional tone of the email. The objective of ATD is not
stealing credentials or data. ATD seeks to coerce a user to the attacker's
desired behavior via the subtle manipulation of trusted interpersonal
relationships. This goes beyond simple phishing and this paper reports the
findings from study that investigated an ATD attack on the politeness strategy
used in work emails.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In previous work, Boemer et al. introduced nGraph-HE, an extension to the
Intel nGraph deep learning (DL) compiler, that enables data scientists to
deploy models with popular frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch with
minimal code changes. However, the class of supported models was limited to
relatively shallow networks with polynomial activations. Here, we introduce
nGraph-HE2, which extends nGraph-HE to enable privacy-preserving inference on
standard, pre-trained models using their native activation functions and number
fields (typically real numbers). The proposed framework leverages the CKKS
scheme, whose support for real numbers is friendly to data science, and a
client-aided model using a two-party approach to compute activation functions.
</p>
<p>We first present CKKS-specific optimizations, enabling a 3x-88x runtime
speedup for scalar encoding, and doubling the throughput through a novel use of
CKKS plaintext packing into complex numbers. Second, we optimize
ciphertext-plaintext addition and multiplication, yielding 2.6x-4.2x runtime
speedup. Third, we exploit two graph-level optimizations: lazy rescaling and
depth-aware encoding, which allow us to significantly improve performance.
</p>
<p>Together, these optimizations enable state-of-the-art throughput of 1,998
images/s on the CryptoNets network. Using the client-aided model, we also
present homomorphic evaluation of (to our knowledge) the largest network to
date, namely, pre-trained MobileNetV2 models on the ImageNet dataset, with
60.4\percent/82.7\percent\ top-1/top-5 accuracy and an amortized runtime of 381
ms/image.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Free-viewpoint video, as the development direction of the next-generation video technologies, uses the depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) technique for the synthesis of video sequences at viewpoints, where real captured videos are missing. As reference videos at multiple viewpoints are not available, a blind reliable real-time quality metric of the synthesized video is needed. Although no-reference quality metrics dedicated to synthesized views successfully evaluate synthesized images, they are not that effective when evaluating synthesized video due to additional temporal flicker distortion typical only for video. In this paper, a new fast no-reference quality metric of synthesized video with synthesis distortions is proposed. It is guided by the fact that the DIBR-synthesized images are characterized by increased high frequency content. The metric is designed under the assumption that the perceived quality of DIBR-synthesized video can be estimated by quantifying the selected areas in the high-high wavelet subband. The threshold is used to select the most important distortion sensitive regions. The proposed No-Reference Morphological Wavelet with Threshold (NR&#x005f;MWT) metric is computationally extremely efficient, comparable to PSNR, as the morphological wavelet transformation uses very short filters and only integer arithmetic. It is completely blind, without using machine learning techniques. Tested on the publicly available dataset of synthesized video sequences characterized by synthesis distortions, the metric achieves better performances and higher computational efficiency than the state-of-the-art metrics dedicated to DIBR-synthesized images and videos.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Scene text detection is an important step in the scene text reading system. The main challenges lie in significantly varied sizes and aspect ratios, arbitrary orientations, and shapes. Driven by the recent progress in deep learning, impressive performances have been achieved for multi-oriented text detection. Yet, the performance drops dramatically in detecting the curved texts due to the limited text representation (e.g., horizontal bounding boxes, rotated rectangles, or quadrilaterals). It is of great interest to detect the curved texts, which are actually very common in natural scenes. In this paper, we present a novel text detector named TextField for detecting irregular scene texts. Specifically, we learn a direction field pointing away from the nearest text boundary to each text point. This direction field is represented by an image of 2D vectors and learned via a fully convolutional neural network. It encodes both binary text mask and direction information used to separate adjacent text instances, which is challenging for the classical segmentation-based approaches. Based on the learned direction field, we apply a simple yet effective morphological-based post-processing to achieve the final detection. The experimental results show that the proposed TextField outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (28&#x0025; and 8&#x0025;) on two curved text datasets: Total-Text and SCUT-CTW1500, respectively; TextField also achieves very competitive performance on multi-oriented datasets: ICDAR 2015 and MSRA-TD500. Furthermore, TextField is robust in generalizing unseen datasets.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We propose an underwater image enhancement model inspired by the morphology and function of the teleost fish retina. We aim to solve the problems of underwater image degradation raised by the blurring and nonuniform color biasing. In particular, the feedback from color-sensitive horizontal cells to cones and a red channel compensation are used to correct the nonuniform color bias. The center-surround opponent mechanism of the bipolar cells and the feedback from amacrine cells to interplexiform cells then to horizontal cells serve to enhance the edges and contrasts of the output image. The ganglion cells with color-opponent mechanism are used for color enhancement and color correction. Finally, we adopt a luminance-based fusion strategy to reconstruct the enhanced image from the outputs of ON and OFF pathways of fish retina. Our model utilizes the global statistics (i.e., image contrast) to automatically guide the design of each low-level filter, which realizes the self-adaption of the main parameters. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on various underwater scenes validate the competitive performance of our technique. Our model also significantly improves the accuracy of transmission map estimation and local feature point matching using the underwater image. Our method is a single image approach that does not require the specialized prior about the underwater condition or scene structure.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>An extensive study on the in-loop filter has been proposed for a high efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard to reduce compression artifacts, thus improving coding efficiency. However, in the existing approaches, the in-loop filter is always applied to each single frame, without exploiting the content correlation among multiple frames. In this paper, we propose a multi-frame in-loop filter (MIF) for HEVC, which enhances the visual quality of each encoded frame by leveraging its adjacent frames. Specifically, we first construct a large-scale database containing encoded frames and their corresponding raw frames of a variety of content, which can be used to learn the in-loop filter in HEVC. Furthermore, we find that there usually exist a number of reference frames of higher quality and of similar content for an encoded frame. Accordingly, a reference frame selector (RFS) is designed to identify these frames. Then, a deep neural network for MIF (known as MIF-Net) is developed to enhance the quality of each encoded frame by utilizing the spatial information of this frame and the temporal information of its neighboring higher-quality frames. The MIF-Net is built on the recently developed DenseNet, benefiting from its improved generalization capacity and computational efficiency. In addition, a novel block-adaptive convolutional layer is designed and applied in the MIF-Net, for handling the artifacts influenced by coding tree unit (CTU) structure in HEVC. Extensive experiments show that our MIF approach achieves on average 11.621&#x0025; saving of the Bj&#x00f8;ntegaard delta bit-rate (BD-BR) on the standard test set, significantly outperforming the standard in-loop filter in HEVC and other state-of-the-art approaches.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a robust sequential dictionary learning (DL) algorithm is presented. The proposed algorithm is motivated from the maximum likelihood perspective on dictionary learning and its link to the minimization of the Kullback&#x2013;Leibler divergence. It is obtained by using a robust loss function in the data fidelity term of the DL objective instead of the usual quadratic loss. The proposed robust loss function is derived from the  $alpha $ -divergence as an alternative to the Kullback&#x2013;Leibler divergence, which leads to a quadratic loss. Compared to other robust approaches, the proposed loss has the advantage of belonging to class of redescending M-estimators, guaranteeing inference stability from large deviations from the Gaussian nominal noise model. The algorithm is obtained by solving a sequence of penalized rank-1 matrix approximation problems, where the  $ell _{1}$ -norm is introduced as a penalty promoting sparsity and then using a block coordinate descent approach to estimate the unknowns. Performance comparison with similar robust DL algorithms on digit recognition, background removal, and gray-scale image denoising is performed highlighting efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In Reply Dr Yang and colleagues highlight some of the key challenges facing the field of biomarker discovery in general and in particular with the use of PD-L1 metrics to predict immunotherapy response in NSCLC. We agree that there are numerous challenges to interpreting PD-L1 pathological data, including the antibody clone used, intensity of staining, heterogeneity of expression within the tumor, and changes in expression over time and with interval treatments. Ultimately, controlling for all of these variables, even in the context of a clinical trial (eg, requiring evaluation of PD-L1 status from multiple biopsy sites), is very challenging and further highlights the importance of exploring these data in a real-world data set where community clinical practice precludes optimization of all of these parameters. Nevertheless, as noted in the Methods section of the article, we defined positive and negative PD-L1 results using previously published standards, including a requirement of 50% staining in a central laboratory using the 22C3 or SP142 antibodies, or annotation in the medical record of a positive result. Cases that did not adhere to these guidelines were excluded.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>From the practical perspective, with large-scale cargoes or nonnegligible hook masses, the centers of gravity of cargoes and hooks do not coincide with each other, and shipboard cranes usually exhibit complex double-pendulum effects during ship-to-ship or ship-to-harbor transportation, which dramatically increase the complexity of dynamic characteristics and make the control issue very challenging. At present, there is no reported work on control of double-pendulum shipboard cranes yet. To tackle such problems, this paper obtains the dynamic model of double-pendulum shipboard cranes and then provides an effective nonlinear antiswing feedback controller to achieve stable cargo transportation. Specifically, new state variable signals are generated by combining the original state variables with the ship motion (induced by sea wave perturbations). Based on this, by adding some elaborately designed nonlinear terms, an antiswing feedback controller is proposed, which can achieve stable transportation with suppressed swing, and the closed-loop asymptotic stability is proven without any linearizations or approximations to the original complex nonlinear dynamics, with rigorous theoretical analysis. As far as we know, the paper provides the first solution for both controller design and stability analysis of double-pendulum shipboard cranes. Also, several groups of hardware experiments are implemented on a self-built hardware experiment platform, which verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In order to overcome the shortcomings of the measurement methods for gas cumulative flow, especially in the long-term continuous measurement, a novel memristor-based gas cumulative flow sensor is proposed in this paper. The sensor is mainly composed of a hot-wire resistor, the memristor module, a feedback compensation network and some basic circuit components. According to the thermal balance equation and the memory characteristics of memristor, the sensor can measure the gas cumulative flow by combining the memristor resistance with the cross-sectional area of the pipe. In order to verify the design of memristor-based gas accumulation flow sensor, experiments are carried out under a constant gas flow velocity, a gradually increasing flow velocity, and a randomly varying flow velocity. The active region thickness D of the selected TiO2/TiO<sub>2-n</sub> memristor is 40 nm. The hot-wire used is a tungsten wire having a radius of 10 &#x03bc;m and a length of 2 mm. The gas measured is air at a temperature of 300 K in the paper. The experimental results show that the sensor achieves the measurement of gas cumulative flow. When gas flow velocity at the center of the pipe is 5 m/s, the measuring range is approximately 0-20 m<sup>3</sup> and the sensitivity within the effective range is approximately 28.44 &#x03a9;/m<sup>3</sup>. When the gas flow velocity, the memristor pairs increase and the gain of the amplifier changes, the measuring range, and the sensitivity of the sensor will changes accordingly.

<p>This letter proposes a method to further improve the efficiency of power amplifiers (PAs). A thermoelectric generator is used to harvest the thermal energy produced by the PA and transform it into electric energy. Then, the efficiency of the PA can be improved by feeding the obtained electric energy to the drain power supply via a dc-dc converter. For verification, a 10-W 3.2-3.8-GHz class-F PA for base station applications is built; the generated temperature distribution and the process of energy conversion are evaluated. Cost-effective commercial chips are applied to harvest, transform, convert, and feedback the energies to the drain supply. The measurement results demonstrate an improvement of 1.1% drain efficiency at the peak output.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Thanks to the advantages of high power density and the capacity of bidirectional power transfer, the CLLC resonant converter is widely used in the hybrid ac-dc microgrid as a dc transformer to interlink the ac and dc bus. Since the voltages of ac and dc bus are controlled by the energy management system, the CLLC resonant converter operates under open-loop condition, which means the switching frequency and duty cycle are fixed. As a result, in the hybrid ac-dc microgrid applications, for the CLLC converter, the main concern is not the voltage regulation but the conversion efficiency. This paper focuses on the total power loss optimization and the magnetic design of the CLLC resonant converter based on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm. In order to optimize the total power loss, an AI algorithm-based two-stage optimal design method is proposed. In the first stage, the total power loss, including the driving loss, turn-off loss, conduction loss of the switches, the power loss of the resonant capacitances, and copper and core loss of the transformer are optimized by the proposed AI algorithm, GA+PSO, and the optimal parameters, including the leakage inductances (L<sub>r1</sub> and L<sub>r2</sub>), magnetizing inductance (L<sub>m</sub>), and resonant capacitances (C<sub>r1</sub> and C<sub>r2</sub>) are derived. In the second stage, the optimal leakage inductances and magnetizing inductance are realized by setting proper distance between the primary winding and the secondary winding (d<sub>w</sub>), and the thickness of the air gap (d<sub>a</sub>). As for the magnetic design, in this paper, the leakage inductances of a planar transformer are used as the resonant inductances. The equations of dw and da to achieve the optimal leakage inductances and magnetizing inductance are derived. Both the proposed optimal design method and the equations of dw and da are validated by simulations and experiments.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A significant portion (ca. 40%) of the world's total energy is utilized in buildings. Cooling of large buildings worldwide is done by centrifugal chiller systems, where the compressors, pumps, and fans are driven by ac motors. These motors are energy hungry parts of the chiller. All-variable speed chillers, taking into account load variations, reduced the energy demand significantly compared to the constant speed ones. Induction motors (IMs) are commonly used in modern chillers. However, as the efficiency of the IM decreases with the speed, the overall efficiency drops, as the chiller operates most of the time in part-load condition. In this paper, SimulationX software is used to quantitatively investigate about the energy efficiency improvement by using synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) in all-variable speed centrifugal chillers. The system was tested for three distinct building load profiles. The results are judged in comparison with the state-of-the-art IE2 IMs. The results provide quantitative evidence that SynRM can significantly increase the energy efficiency in the chiller systems and has a big potential to substitute IMs in these applications.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel sensor-less switching method based on logic gates for a five-level packed U-cell (PUC5) converter. It comprises only two level-shifted triangular carriers and logic gates. Hence, the number of triangular carriers is halved and the switching states table is eliminated, which cause remarkable reduction in complexity of the proposed modulation method. Moreover, employing the proposed sensor-less switching method leads to decrease in the PUC5 capacitor value by a factor of carrier ratio, fast self-balancing of the PUC5 capacitor voltage, and halving the output LC filter inductor and capacitor values in stand-alone mode, as well as the grid-link inductor value in grid-connected mode. In addition, the PUC5 converter start-up transient time is considerably decreased and the first switching harmonic cluster frequency is doubled, which lead to notable improvement of steady-state and dynamic performances of the PUC5 converter. The proposed sensor-less switching method has been implemented in both stand-alone and grid-connected operating modes of PUC5 converter. Provided simulation and experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed sensor-less switching method as well as its improved dynamic and steady-state performances in both stand-alone and grid-connected modes.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Participatory sensing is a crowdsourcing-based framework, where the platform executes the sensing requests with the help of many common peoples' handheld devices (typically smartphones). In this paper, we mainly address the online sensing request admission and smartphone selection problem to maximize the profit of the platform, taking into account the queue backlog, and the location of sensing requests and smartphones. First, we formulate this problem as a discrete time model and design a location aware online admission and selection control algorithm (LAAS) based on the Lyapunov optimization technique. The LAAS algorithm only depends on the currently available information and makes all the control decisions independently and simultaneously. Next, we utilize the recent advancement of the accurate prediction of smartphones' mobility and sensing request arrival information in the next few time slots and develop a predictive location aware admission and selection control algorithm (PLAAS). We further design a greedy predictive location aware admission and selection control algorithm (GPLAAS) to achieve the online implementation of PLAAS approximately and iteratively. Theoretical analysis shows that under any control parameter V &gt; 0, both LAAS and PLAAS algorithm can achieve O(1/V)-optimal average profit, while the sensing request backlog is bounded by O(V). Extensive numerical results based on both synthetic and real trace show that LAAS outperforms the Greedy algorithm and Random algorithm and GPLAAS improves the profit-backlog tradeoff over LAAS.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Public cloud offers economy of scale to adapt workload changes in an autonomic manner, maximizing the use of resources. Through network function virtualization (NFV), network operators can move LTE core to the cloud; hence removing their dependency on carrier-grade LTE network functions. Recent research efforts discuss performance, latency, and fault tolerance of LTE NFV, largely ignoring the security aspects. In this paper, we discover new vulnerabilities that LTE NFV face today with no standard solutions to address them. These vulnerabilities span at both LTE control and user planes. To address them, we propose vEPC-sec that cryptographically secures LTE control-plane signaling messages in the cloud. It provides distributed key management and key derivation schemes to derive shared-symmetric keys for securing the communication between any two network functions. Our approach provides encryption and integrity protection to the messages even during virtual machines scalability and failure recovery scenarios. vEPC-sec also prevents user-plane vulnerabilities by ensuring that LTE routing modules should faithfully forward the LTE subscriber packets.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In cyberspace, evolutionary strategies are commonly used by both attackers and defenders. For example, an attacker's strategy often changes over the course of time, as new vulnerabilities are discovered and/or mitigated. Similarly, a defender's strategy changes over time. These changes may or may not be in direct response to a change in the opponent's strategy. In any case, it is important to have a set of quantitative metrics to characterize and understand the effectiveness of attackers' and defenders' evolutionary strategies, which reflect their cyber agility. Despite its clear importance, few systematic metrics have been developed to quantify the cyber agility of attackers and defenders. In this paper, we propose the first metric framework for measuring cyber agility in terms of the effectiveness of the dynamic evolution of cyber attacks and defenses. The proposed framework is generic and applicable to transform any relevant, quantitative, and/or conventional static security metrics (e.g., false positives and false negatives) into dynamic metrics to capture dynamics of system behaviors. In order to validate the usefulness of the proposed framework, we conduct case studies on measuring the evolution of cyber attacks and defenses using two real-world datasets. We discuss the limitations of the current work and identify future research directions.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The deployment of smart hybrid heat pumps (SHHPs) can introduce considerable benefits to electricity systems via smart switching between electricity and gas while minimizing the total heating cost for each individual customer. In particular, the fully optimized control technology can provide flexible heat that redistributes the heat demand across time for improving the utilization of low-carbon generation and enhancing the overall energy efficiency of the heating system. To this end, an accurate quantification of the preheating is of great importance to characterize the flexible heat. This paper proposes a novel data-driven preheating quantification method to estimate the capability of the heat pump demand shifting and isolate the effect of interventions. Varieties of fine-grained data from a real-world trial are exploited to estimate the baseline heat demand using Bayesian deep learning while jointly considering epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. A comprehensive range of case studies are carried out to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed quantification method, and then, the estimated demand shift is used as an input into the whole-system model to investigate the system implications and quantify the range of benefits of rolling out the SHHPs developed by PassivSystems to the future GB electricity systems.

<p>Obtaining an appropriate model is very crucial to develop an efficient energy management system for the smart home, including photovoltaic (PV) array, plug-in electric vehicle (PEV), home loads, and heat pump (HP). Stochastic modeling methods of smart homes explain random parameters and uncertainties of the aforementioned components. In this paper, a concise yet comprehensive analysis and comparison are presented for these techniques. First, modeling methods are implemented to find appropriate and precise forecasting models for PV, PEV, HP, and home load demand. Then, the accuracy of each model is validated by the real measured data. Finally, the pros and cons of each method are discussed and reviewed. The obtained results show the conditions under which the methods can provide a reliable and accurate description of smart home dynamics.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>At present, the fusion of different unimodal biometrics has attracted increasing attention from researchers, who are dedicated to the practical application of biometrics. In this paper, we explored a multi-biometric algorithm that integrates palmprints and dorsal hand veins (DHV). Palmprint recognition has a rather high accuracy and reliability, and the most significant advantage of DHV recognition is the biopsy (Liveness detection). In order to combine the advantages of both and implement the fusion method, deep learning and graph matching were, respectively, introduced to identify palmprint and DHV. Upon using the deep hashing network (DHN), biometric images can be encoded as 128-bit codes. Then, the Hamming distances were used to represent the similarity of two codes. Biometric graph matching (BGM) can obtain three discriminative features for classification. In order to improve the accuracy of open-set recognition, in multi-modal fusion, the score-level fusion of DHN and BGM was performed and authentication was provided by support vector machine (SVM). Furthermore, based on DHN, all four levels of fusion strategies were used for multi-modal recognition of palmprint and DHV. Evaluation experiments and comprehensive comparisons were conducted on various commonly used datasets, and the promising results were obtained in this case where the equal error rates (EERs) of both palmprint recognition and multi-biometrics equal 0, demonstrating the great superiority of DHN in biometric verification.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Touchless palmprint recognition systems enable high-accuracy recognition of individuals through less-constrained and highly usable procedures that do not require the contact of the palm with a surface. To perform this recognition, methods based on local texture descriptors and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are currently used to extract highly discriminative features while compensating for variations in scale, rotation, and illumination in biometric samples. In particular, the main advantage of CNN-based methods is their ability to adapt to biometric samples captured with heterogeneous devices. However, the current methods rely on either supervised training algorithms, which require class labels (e.g., the identities of the individuals) during the training phase, or filters pretrained on general-purpose databases, which may not be specifically suitable for palmprint data. To achieve a high-recognition accuracy with touchless palmprint samples captured using different devices while neither requiring class labels for training nor using pretrained filters, we introduce PalmNet, which is a novel CNN that uses a newly developed method to tune palmprint-specific filters through an unsupervised procedure based on Gabor responses and principal component analysis (PCA), not requiring class labels during training. PalmNet is a new method of applying Gabor filters in a CNN and is designed to extract highly discriminative palmprint-specific descriptors and to adapt to heterogeneous databases. We validated the innovative PalmNet on several palmprint databases captured using different touchless acquisition procedures and heterogeneous devices, and in all cases, a recognition accuracy greater than that of the current methods in this paper was obtained.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We propose a novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-inspired jamming and relaying scheme to enhance the physical layer security of untrusted relay networks. Particularly, during the first phase, with the application of the downlink NOMA principle, the source sends a superimposed version of a desired signal and a jamming signal, where the jamming signal is designed to deliberately confuse the untrusted relay by exploiting the beamforming design and adapting the transmission rate at the source. During the second phase, relying on the uplink NOMA principle, the untrusted relay forwards its received signals and, simultaneously, the source transmits a new desired signal that cannot be wiretapped by the untrusted relay to maximize the secrecy sum rate. Scenarios of single-antenna and multiple-antenna relaying are considered, and the impact of different antenna configurations at the source and the untrusted relay on the secrecy performance is investigated. Analytical expressions of an ergodic secrecy sum rate (ESSR) lower bound and an asymptotic ESSR scaling law are derived to evaluate the secrecy performance of the proposed NOMA-inspired jamming and relaying scheme. Computer simulations are presented to validate the accuracy of the derived analytical results, and demonstrate the significant ESSR improvement of the proposed scheme over the conventional orthogonal multiple access-based relaying schemes.
