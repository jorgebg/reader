<p>A new study published this week [Nov. 25, 2019] in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by American and Israeli geoscientists and climatologists provides evidence that summer monsoons from Asia and Africa may have reached into the Middle East for periods of time going back at least 125,000 years, providing suitable corridors for human migration.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Low-power wide area networks (LPWANs), such as LoRa, are fast emerging as the
preferred networking technology for large-scale Internet of Things deployments
(e.g., smart cities). Due to long communication range and ultra low power
consumption, LPWAN-enabled sensors are today being deployed in a variety of
application scenarios where sensitive information is wirelessly transmitted. In
this work, we study the privacy guarantees of LPWANs, in particular LoRa. We
show that, although the event-based duty cycling of radio communication, i.e.,
transmission of radio signals only when an event occurs, saves power, it
inherently leaks information. This information leakage is independent of the
implemented crypto primitives. We identify two types of information leakage and
show that it is hard to completely prevent leakage without incurring
significant additional communication and computation costs.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Previous research works have endorsed the use of delays and clock skews for
detecting intrusions or fingerprinting ECUs on the CAN bus. Similar techniques
have been also proposed for establishing a time-covert cryptographic
authentication channel, in this way cleverly removing the need for
cryptographic material inside the limited payload of CAN frames. The main
shortcoming of such works is the limited security level that can be achieved
under normal CAN-bus traffic. In this work we endeavour to test the limits of
the achievable security level by relying on optimization algorithms for
scheduling CAN frames. Under practical bus allocations that are based on
real-world scenarios, we are able to extract around 4--5 bits of authentication
data from each frame which leads to an efficient intrusion detection and
authentication mechanism. By accumulating covert channel data over several
consecutive frames, we can achieve higher security levels that are in line with
current security demands. To prove the correctness of our approach, we present
experiments on state-of-the-art automotive-grade controllers (Infineon Aurix)
and bus measurements with the use of industry standard tools, i.e., CANoe.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In the last two years, more than 200 papers have been written on how machine
learning (ML) systems can fail because of adversarial attacks on the algorithms
and data; this number balloons if we were to incorporate papers covering
non-adversarial failure modes. The spate of papers has made it difficult for ML
practitioners, let alone engineers, lawyers, and policymakers, to keep up with
the attacks against and defenses of ML systems. However, as these systems
become more pervasive, the need to understand how they fail, whether by the
hand of an adversary or due to the inherent design of a system, will only
become more pressing. In order to equip software developers, security incident
responders, lawyers, and policy makers with a common vernacular to talk about
this problem, we developed a framework to classify failures into "Intentional
failures" where the failure is caused by an active adversary attempting to
subvert the system to attain her goals; and "Unintentional failures" where the
failure is because an ML system produces an inherently unsafe outcome. After
developing the initial version of the taxonomy last year, we worked with
security and ML teams across Microsoft, 23 external partners, standards
organization, and governments to understand how stakeholders would use our
framework. Throughout the paper, we attempt to highlight how machine learning
failure modes are meaningfully different from traditional software failures
from a technology and policy perspective.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Mobile autonomous systems, robots, and cyber-physical systems rely on
accurate positioning information. To conduct distance-measurement, two devices
exchange signals and, knowing these signals propagate at the speed of light,
the time of arrival is used for distance estimations. Existing
distance-measurement techniques are incapable of protecting against adversarial
distance enlargement---a highly devastating tactic in which the adversary
reissues a delayed version of the signals transmitted between devices, after
distorting the authentic signal to prevent the receiver from identifying it.
The adversary need not break crypto, nor compromise any upper-layer security
protocols for mounting this attack. No known solution currently exists to
protect against distance enlargement. We present \textit{Ultra-Wideband
Enlargement Detection} (UWB-ED), a new modulation technique to detect distance
enlargement attacks, and securely verify distances between two mutually trusted
devices. We analyze UWB-ED under an adversary that injects signals to
block/modify authentic signals. We show how UWB-ED is a good candidate for
802.15.4z Low Rate Pulse and the 5G standard.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we present a novel method of differentiating known from
previously unseen malware families. We utilize transfer learning by learning
compact file representations that are used for a new classification task
between previously seen malware families and novel ones. The learned file
representations are composed of static and dynamic features of malware and are
invariant to small modifications that do not change their malicious
functionality. Using an extensive dataset that consists of thousands of
variants of malicious files, we were able to achieve 97.7% accuracy when
classifying between seen and unseen malware families. Our method provides an
important focalizing tool for cybersecurity researchers and greatly improves
the overall ability to adapt to the fast-moving pace of the current threat
landscape.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The accuracy of power electronics simulation relies on the semiconductor switch model employed. Thus, in this paper where an ultrafast mechatronic circuit breaker (UFMCB) is implemented in real-time on the field programmable gate array, a detailed nonlinear thyristor model is proposed for extra device-level information regarding design evaluation. The cascaded thyristors impose a heavy computational burden on the UFMCB simulation, and node elimination is achieved following the proposal of a scalable thyristor model. For the convenience of the circuit breaker's integration into dc grid, a pair of coupled voltage-current sources is inserted as its interface, which achieves a reduction in the dimension of system admittance matrix, and the subsequent proposal of a relaxed scalar Newton-Raphson method further expedites the simulation by decomposing the nodal matrix equation. Meanwhile, the modular multilevel converter as a dc grid terminal adopts half-bridge and clamped double submodule topologies to test system performance in conjunction with the UFMCB. Real-time execution is achieved and the results are validated by ANSYS/Simplorer and PSCAD/EMTDC in device- and system-level, respectively.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a new transformerless buck-boost converter based on a ZETA converter is introduced. The proposed converter has the ZETA converter advantages, such as buck-boost capability, input-to-output dc insulation, and continuous output current. The suggested converter voltage gain is higher than the classic ZETA converter. In the presented converter, only one main switch is utilized. The proposed converter offers low voltage stress of the switch; therefore, the low on-state resistance of the main switch can be selected to decrease the losses of the switch. The presented converter topology is simple; hence, the control of the converter is simple. The converter has the continuous output current. The mathematical analyses of the presented converter are given. The experimental results confirm the correctness of the analysis.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent development of object detection mainly depends on deep learning with large-scale benchmarks. However, collecting such fully-annotated data is often difficult or expensive for real-world applications, which restricts the power of deep neural networks in practice. Alternatively, humans can detect new objects with little annotation burden, since humans often use the prior knowledge to identify new objects with few elaborately-annotated examples, and subsequently generalize this capacity by exploiting objects from wild images. Inspired by this procedure of learning to detect, we propose a novel Progressive Object Transfer Detection (POTD) framework. Specifically, we make three main contributions in this paper. First, POTD can leverage various object supervision of different domains effectively into a progressive detection procedure. Via such human-like learning, one can boost a target detection task with few annotations. Second, POTD consists of two delicate transfer stages, i.e., Low-Shot Transfer Detection (LSTD), and Weakly-Supervised Transfer Detection (WSTD). In LSTD, we distill the implicit object knowledge of source detector to enhance target detector with few annotations. It can effectively warm up WSTD later on. In WSTD, we design a recurrent object labelling mechanism for learning to annotate weakly-labeled images. More importantly, we exploit the reliable object supervision from LSTD, which can further enhance the robustness of target detector in the WSTD stage. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on a number of challenging detection benchmarks with different settings. The results demonstrate that, our POTD outperforms the recent state-of-the-art approaches. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/Cassie94/LSTD/tree/lstd.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The human visual system tends to consider saliency of an object as a whole. Some object-level saliency detection methods have been proposed by leveraging object proposals in bounding boxes, and regarding the entire bounding box as one candidate salient region. However, the bounding boxes can not provide exact object position and a lot of pixels in bounding boxes belong to the background. Consequently, background pixels in bounding box also show high saliency. Besides, acquiring object proposals needs high time cost. In order to compute object-level saliency, we consider region growing from some seed superpixels, to find one surrounding region which probably represents the whole object. The desired surrounding region has similar appearance inside and obvious difference with the outside, which is proposed as maximally stable region (MSR) in this paper. In addition, one effective seed superpixel selection strategy is presented to improve speed. MSR based saliency detection is more robust than pixel or superpixel level methods and object proposal based methods. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods at 50 FPS. Compared with deep learning based methods, we show worse performance, but with about 1200-1600 times faster, which means better trade-off between performance and speed.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The dynamic performance of automatic generation control (AGC) primarily relies upon the performance index criteria (PIC) being used to optimize the supplementary controller gains. Most of the previous AGC studies were focused on developing various intelligent controllers and meta-heuristic algorithms to improve the system dynamic performance of the AGC system. However, no significant efforts were made to formulate effective PICs in order to acquire better supplementary control and improved AGC dynamic performance. In this paper, a maiden attempt has been made and new hybrid-peak-area-based PICs have been proposed for the optimal tuning of supplementary controller gains. The proposed PICs have been implemented upon single area as well as standard New England IEEE 39 bus system. Sensitivity analysis has also been carried out to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PICs for wide changes in AGC power system model parameters. The proposed PICs demonstrate better dynamic performance in comparison to existing PICs in terms of overshoot, subsequent oscillations, and settling time.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents an energy-efficient localization of sensor nodes in wireless sensor network (WSNs) using beacons from rotating directional antenna. The localization process is scalable, fast, and easily implementable at the nodes, and works for homogeneous as well as heterogeneous networks. The process is suitable for dense and sparse deployment of nodes because communication among nodes is not required and no transmission is needed from nodes to base station (BS). Furthermore, a rotating directional antenna is used at the BS to transmit beacon signal packet containing information about the height of the antenna, current direction, transmitted power, and GPS coordinate of BS. By using the information received from the beacon packets, each node estimates its location relative to BS (in polar coordinate). The time required, energy consumption, and accuracy are estimated analytically. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves accuracy and energy efficiency for two-dimensional localization of sensor nodes in WSNs.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In a noisy manufacturing environment, range-based target localization for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) experiences various variations in range measurements, thus causing the unsatisfactory results. Starting from an empirical observation on the existing various industrial noise distribution, in this paper, a diffusion Gauss&#x2013;Newton (GN) algorithm with cooperation strategy is proposed for solving target localization non linear-least-squares problem in a WSN. The proposed algorithm has an equalization effect on the unbalance noise distribution over the network by aggregating the global estimates into local GN update via diffusion strategy. When facing a hostile industrial environment where the ambient noise is heterogeneous or has the sudden changes across partial nodes, the significant performance degradation is produced by diffusion GN. To solve the problem, we propose further an improved version of diffusion GN, which is adaptive to sudden changes on noisy range measurements. Instead of using a static combiner, the new algorithm leverages the evolutionary game theory to assign a time-varying weight for the estimate from each neighboring node based on the individual range error. Consequently, the good estimates from the neighbors with high SNR have a larger weight in the combiner than the bad estimates caused by the low SNR or high noise. We also propose a simple but effective energy-accuracy tradeoff scheme by using a sigmoidal utility function. Some simulation examples show that the standard diffusion GN is effective in stationary noise and its improved version provides the adaptation to changing noisy environment. The effectiveness of energy&#x2013;accuracy tradeoff is also validated.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Spectral analysis is a practical technology used for rapid analysis of fruit maturity. Least-squares support vector regression (LSSVR) with radial basis function (RBF) kernel is an effective nonlinear method for the quantitative calibration in the visible&#x2013;near-infrared (Vis&#x2013;NIR) spectral region. However, the nonlinear effect and high-dimensional spectrum data influence the prediction accuracy and complexity of modeling procedures. This article presents a fuzzy optimization strategy to improve the performance of the RBF LSSVR model in Vis&#x2013;NIR quantitative determination of pomelo maturity. In the proposed strategy, a linguistic iterative mode is introduced for optimizing RBF kernel parameters. The input variables of the model are the informative features extracted through fuzzy transform principal component analysis algorithm, and the output was a polynomial equation of the inputs. In this article, pomelo maturity is recorded using the quantitative indices of L<sup>&#x002a;</sup>, a<sup>&#x002a;</sup>, and b<sup>&#x002a;</sup>. The Vis&#x2013;NIR spectral data of Pomelo samples are first converted to a set of fuzzy-transformed principal components and inputted into a fuzzy-optimized LSSVR model for calibration, validation, and test. Parameter uncertainty is evaluated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed fuzzy optimization strategy is feasible for reducing the computational complexity of the BRF LSSVR model, and the predictions on L<sup>&#x002a;</sup>, a<sup>&#x002a;</sup>, and b<sup>&#x002a;</sup> are much appreciable. The proposed fuzzy optimization strategy based on the linguistic iteration mode is considered as the effective implementation for calibration models in -

<p>This article presents two novel algorithms for the estimation and diagnosis of the current unbalance factor (CUF) for three-phase power systems from single period of three-phase acquired data samples. The CUF is evaluated by an algorithm named circular phase shift (CPS), and the three-phase parameters are estimated by a circular cross-correlation (CCC) algorithm for unbalance diagnosis. The estimated CUF along with multisensory data is transmitted and monitored through a remote web server for diagnosis and detection of incipient three-phase power systems faults including three-phase machines. The CPS algorithm estimation has an accuracy that exceeds 95&#x0025; for CUF values exceeding 5&#x0025;. The CCC time-complexity and the Cramer&#x2013;Rao Lower Bound analysis are presented for performance evaluation. The CCC algorithm outperforms the IEEE-Standard-1057 estimation method in both phase accuracy and processing memory requirements compatible with low-cost microcontrollers. Experimental results on condition monitoring of industrial induction machines (1.5 to 7.5 KW) are also presented with custom designed 2.4-GHz wireless sensor network and an IEEE 802.11 Internet of Things gateway with multisensory data which carries out the effectiveness of the system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a new robust field-weakening approach for reluctance synchronous motors regulated by direct torque and flux control. Compared to the existing direct torque and flux control based field-weakening methods that cannot achieve maximized DC-link voltage utilization and are parameter dependent, the proposed approach contributes to improve the field-weakening performance of reluctance synchronous motor in two aspects. First, it extends the constant power speed range through autonomous stator flux reference adjustment, which maximizes the dc-link voltage utilization. Smooth transition between the maximum torque per ampere trajectory and field-weakening trajectory is also realized. Second, it enhances the parameter robustness of drives in very high-speed region by employing a torque reference adjustment scheme. This effectively avoids the instability of drives caused by machine parameter variations. The proposed approach is verified experimentally on a laboratory setup.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A path-following controller based on an uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE) for a quadrotor with a cable-suspended payload is proposed in this paper. The quadrotor and the payload are subject to unknown wind disturbances. The controller resembles a cascade architecture. For the outer loop, a UDE-based translational control law is proposed. The controller asymptotically stabilizes the quadrotor along a given path and estimates the lumped disturbances with a low-pass filter. For the inner loop, an attitude tracking controller is used to control the direction of the lift vector so that the actual lift force can asymptotically follow the reference force generated by the translational controller. The stability of the system with the translational controller and the attitude tracking controller has been shown to be asymptotically stable using the reduction theorem. With the help of the reduction theorem, the design of the translational and the attitude control can be decoupled, providing the flexibility of implementing different attitude controllers without redoing the stability analysis. As shown in the simulation, the control law can stabilize the quadrotor on the desired path under different wind disturbances.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a novel three-layer coordinating optimization and control strategy involving fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) is proposed for industrial plant-wide control. This strategy includes a coordinator (top layer), local optimizers (middle layer), and local controllers (bottom layer). The coordinator determines and coordinates set-points of production indices for each process in the plant, aiming to achieve plant-wide optimal control. The local optimizers optimize individual unit and deliver the information to the coordinator. The controllers calculate optimal control inputs for the processes according to the set-points. Model predictive control (MPC) is used in this layer. Also used are FNNs with a gradient-based learning algorithm, which are trained to represent the models of the processes that are controlled by MPC. By constructing a Lyapunov function, convergence of the FNNs is established. Experiments are carried out in the largest zinc hydrometallurgy plant in China. The results demonstrate performance of our strategy in tracking the set-points and saving processing costs. Moreover, the strategy achieves a more optimal overall plant operation when compared to the same FNN-based MPC scheme that does not use the coordinator.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Massive MIMO attains high spectral and power efficiency transmission by leveraging a large number of transmit antennas. However, to capture the benefits of massive MIMO, each antenna should be accompanied with a dedicated RF chain, and consequently, the hardware costs would scale up tremendously with the increase of the antennas. Cheap implementations of massive MIMO have recently gained considerable attention, and constant modulus (CM) signaling is seen as a promising solution, owing to its low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). This paper investigates the physical-layer (PHY) security in massive MIMO with an emphasis on the CM signaling. In particular, we consider a transmitter with massive antennas broadcast common confidential information to a group of legitimate receivers, and a number of eavesdroppers overhear the transmission and attempt to intercept the information. Our goal is to design the CM beamforming at the transmitter so that the multicast secrecy rate is maximized. This secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is generally NP-hard. To tackle it, two tractable approaches are developed. The first one employs the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique and the Charnes-Copper transformation to obtain a convex relaxation of the SRM problem. However, due to the dimension lifting of SDR, this approach is feasible only for small to medium antenna sizes. The second approach leverages the Dinkelbach method to work directly over the beamformer domain; a custom-build nonconvex alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed to efficiently perform each Dinkelbach update. Simulation results demonstrate that the second approach is computationally more efficient and can achieve nearly optimal performance when the number of antennas is large.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The side-channel leakage is a consequence of program execution in a computer processor, and understanding relationship between code execution and information leakage is a necessary step in estimating information leakage and its capacity limits. This paper proposes a methodology to relate program execution to electromagnetic side-channel emanations and estimates side-channel information capacity created by execution of series of instructions (e.g., a function, a procedure, or a program) in a processor. To model dependence among program instructions in a code, we propose to use Markov source model, which includes the dependencies among sequence of instructions as well as dependencies among instructions as they pass through a pipeline of the processor. The emitted electromagnetic (EM) signals during instruction executions are natural choice for the inputs into the model. To obtain the channel inputs for the proposed model, we derive a mathematical relationship between the emanated instruction signal power (ESP) and total emanated signal power while running a program. Then, we derive the leakage capacity of EM side channels created by execution of series of instructions in a processor. Finally, we provide experimental results to demonstrate that leakages could be severe and that a dedicated attacker could obtain important information.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the optimal tradeoff between secrecy and non-secrecy rates of the MISO wiretap channels for different power constraint settings: sum power constraint only, per-antenna power constraints only, and joint sum and per-antenna power constraints. The problem is motivated by the fact that channel capacity and secrecy capacity are generally achieved by different transmit strategies. First, a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure a positive secrecy capacity is shown. The optimal tradeoff between secrecy rate and transmission rate is characterized by a weighted rate sum maximization problem. Since this problem is not necessarily convex, equivalent problem formulations are introduced to derive the optimal transmit strategies. Under sum power constraint only, a closed-form solution is provided. Under per-antenna power constraints, necessary conditions to find the optimal power allocation are derived. Sufficient conditions are provided for the special case of two transmit antennas. For the special case of aligned channels, the optimal transmit strategies can deduced from an equivalent point-to-point channel problem. Last, the theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Anomaly detection is an important technique used to identify patterns of unusual network behavior and keep the network under control. Today, network attacks are increasing in terms of both their number and sophistication. To avoid causing significant traffic patterns and being detected by existing techniques, many new attacks tend to involve gradual adjustment of behaviors, which always generate incomplete sessions due to their running mechanisms. Accordingly, in this work, we employ the behavior symmetry degree to profile the anomalies and further identify unusual behaviors. We first proposed a symmetry degree to identify the incomplete sessions generated by unusual behaviors; we then employ a sketch to calculate the symmetry degree of internal hosts to improve the identification efficiency for online applications. To reduce the memory cost and probability of collision, we divide the IP addresses into four segments that can be used as keys of the hash functions in the sketch. Moreover, to further improve detection accuracy, a threshold selection method is proposed for dynamic traffic pattern analysis. The hash functions in the sketch are then designed using Chinese remainder theory, which can analytically trace the IP addresses associated with the anomalies. We tested the proposed techniques based on traffic data collected from the northwest center of CERNET (China Education and Research Network); the results show that the proposed methods can effectively detect anomalies in large-scale networks.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Image restoration (IR) is a long-standing challenging problem in low-level image processing. It is of utmost importance to learn good image priors for pursuing visually pleasing results. In this paper, we develop a multi-channel and multi-model-based denoising autoencoder network as image prior for solving IR problem. Specifically, the network that trained on RGB-channel images is used to construct a prior at first, and then the learned prior is incorporated into single-channel grayscale IR tasks. To achieve the goal, we employ the auxiliary variable technique to integrate the higher-dimensional network-driven prior information into the iterative restoration procedure. In addition, according to the weighted aggregation idea, a multi-model strategy is put forward to enhance the network stability that favors to avoid getting trapped in local optima. Extensive experiments on image deblurring and deblocking tasks show that the proposed algorithm is efficient, robust, and yields state-of-the-art restoration quality on grayscale images.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel deep sparse coding network (SCN) capable of efficiently adapting its own regularization parameters for a given application. The network is trained end-to-end with a supervised task-driven learning algorithm via error backpropagation. During training, the network learns both the dictionaries and the regularization parameters of each sparse coding layer so that the reconstructive dictionaries are smoothly transformed into increasingly discriminative representations. In addition, the adaptive regularization also offers the network more flexibility to adjust sparsity levels. Furthermore, we have devised a sparse coding layer utilizing a &#x201c;skinny&#x201d; dictionary. Integral to computational efficiency, these skinny dictionaries compress the high-dimensional sparse codes into lower dimensional structures. The adaptivity and discriminability of our 15-layer SCN are demonstrated on six benchmark datasets, namely Cifar-10, Cifar-100, STL-10, SVHN, MNIST, and ImageNet, most of which are considered difficult for sparse coding models. Experimental results show that our architecture overwhelmingly outperforms traditional one-layer sparse coding architectures while using much fewer parameters. Moreover, our multilayer architecture exploits the benefits of depth with sparse coding's characteristic ability to operate on smaller datasets. In such data-constrained scenarios, our technique demonstrates a highly competitive performance compared with the deep neural networks.

<p>We propose an algorithm to efficiently compute approximate solutions of the piecewise affine Mumford-Shah model. The algorithm is based on a novel reformulation of the underlying optimization problem in terms of Taylor jets. A splitting approach leads to linewise segmented jet estimation problems for which we propose an exact and efficient solver. The proposed method has the combined advantages of prior algorithms: it directly yields a partition, it does not need an initialization procedure, and it is highly parallelizable. The experiments show that the algorithm has lower computation times and that the solutions often have lower functional values than the state-of-the-art.
