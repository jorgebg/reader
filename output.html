<p>Alkaline anion exchange membranes (AAEMs) are an important component of alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), which facilitate the efficient conversion of fuels to electricity using nonplatinum electrode catalysts. However, low hydroxide conductivity and poor long-term alkaline stability of AAEMs are the major limitations for the widespread application of AEMFCs....<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Pnas-RssFeedOfEarlyEditionArticles/~4/0JK_Dyhst5E" width="1" />

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Transmission is crucial for big data analysis and learning in industrial Internet of Things (IoT) systems. To transmit data with limited energy is a challenge. This paper studies the problem of data transmission in energy harvesting systems with capacitor to supply energy where the energy receiving rate varies over time. The energy receiving rate is slower when the capacitor receives more energy. Based on this characteristic, we study the problem of how to transmit more data when the energy receiving time is not continuous. Given many packets that arrive at different time instances, there is a tradeoff between transmitting the packet right now or saving the energy to transmit the future arriving packets. We formalize two types of problems. The first one is how to minimize the total completion time when there is enough energy to transmit all the packets. The second one is how to transmit as many packets as possible when the energy is not enough to transmit all the packets. For the first problem, we give a 1 + &#x03b1; approximation off line algorithm when all the information of the packets and the energy receiving periods is known in advance, and a max{2, &#x03b2;} competitive ratio online algorithm where the information is not known in advance. For the second problem, we study three cases and give a 6 + [h/(b/R)] approximation off line algorithm for the general situation. We also prove that there does not exit a constant competitive ratio online algorithm.

<p>In March, 2016, Sikhosiphi &#8220;Bazooka&#8221; Rhadebe, who had been protesting against a titanium mine in the Xolobeni region of South Africa, received eight shots to the head in his home. Three years later, the perpetrators have not been identified. Rhadebe's death was in no way an isolated incident, as was reported in a joint report published April 16 by the Centre for Environmental Rights, groundWork, Earthjustice, and Human Rights Watch, which finds that those who dare protest against mining activities in South Africa face harassment, intimidation, or violence.

<p>Gambling has been identified as a threat to health,1 but responses, including policy and industry-funded corporate social responsibility initiatives, continue to focus on individual gamblers rather than, as is increasingly accepted for other health threats, challenging the companies that profit from this misery. There is a need to rapidly move away from this individual&#8211;level narrative and address the wider corporate determinants of health in relation to gambling. At the same time, there is a need to limit the ability of industry to prevent the implementation of effective measures.

<p>Unusual as it might seem in a post-everything world, Japan is welcoming (and pondering the meaning of) a new imperial era. The Reiwa period begins on May 1, 2019, with the accession of Crown Prince Naruhito as the country's 126th Emperor. There is some uncertainty about the meaning of Reiwa, but the official translation is &#8220;beautiful harmony&#8221;. The end of Emperor Akihito's Heisei period is a useful moment to reflect on Japan's future. Japan is a &#8220;great power&#8221;&#8212;a member of the G7 and G20, and the world's third largest economy.

<p>A 28-year-old man presented to our hospital with exertional dyspnoea that had become gradually worse over the previous 3 months. On clinical examination of his heart, the apex was displaced laterally and inferiorly, the first heart sound was muffled, and there was a grade IV&#8211;VI apical pan-systolic murmur. 2 days after admission, the patient developed a non-haemorrhagic stroke. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a dilated left ventricle with global hypokinesia and impaired systolic function: the left ventricular ejection fraction was 33% (video 1).

Evidence shows that &#8220;financial toxicity&#8221; arising from drug costs and other medical expenses is reducing financial security for many families and prompting difficult choices, as patients defer or forgo therapies they cannot afford. In stark contrast, comparable countries negotiate drug prices and use drugs more effectively. Recent data suggest that other high-income countries have an average life expectancy approximately 3 to 5 years longer than that of the United States, which ranks last among high-income countries and is losing ground compared with peer nations. Although drug prices account for only part of these trends, they nevertheless add to disparities that dominate the trajectories of US health outcomes.</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deception plays critical roles in economics and technology, especially in emerging interactions in cyberspace. Holistic models of deception are needed in order to analyze interactions and to design mechanisms that improve them. Game theory provides such models. In particular, existing work models deception using signaling games. But signaling games inherently model deception that is undetectable. In this paper, we extend signaling games by including a detector that gives off probabilistic warnings when the sender acts deceptively. Then, we derive pooling and partially separating equilibria of the game. We find that: 1) high quality detectors eliminate some pure-strategy equilibria; 2) detectors with high true-positive rates encourage more honest signaling than detectors with low false-positive rates; 3) receivers obtain optimal outcomes for equal-error-rate detectors; and 4) surprisingly, deceptive senders sometimes benefit from highly accurate deception detectors. We illustrate these results with an application to defensive deception for network security. Our results provide a quantitative and rigorous analysis of the fundamental aspects of detectable deception.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The detection of rescaling operations represents an important task in multimedia forensics. While many effective heuristics have been proposed, there is no theory on the forensic detectability revealing the conditions of more or less reliable detection. We study the problem of discriminating 1D and 2D genuine signals from signals that have been downscaled with the goal of quantifying the statistical distinguishability between these two hypotheses. This is done by assuming known signal models and deriving the expressions of statistical distances that are linked to the hypothesis testing theory, namely, the symmetrized form of Kullback&#x2013;Leibler divergence known as the Jeffreys divergence, and the Bhattacharyya divergence. The analysis is performed for varying parameters of both the genuine signal model (variance and one-step correlation) and the rescaling process (rescaling factor, interpolation kernel, grid shift, and anti-alias filter), thus allowing us to reveal the insights on their influence and interplay. In addition to the signal itself, we consider the signal transformations (prefilter and covariance matrix estimators) that are often involved in practical rescaling detectors, showing that they yield similar results in terms of distinguishability. Numerical tests on synthetic and real signals confirm the main observations from the theoretical analysis.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Conventionally, standard proportional and integral (PI) controllers with constant PI gains are commonly used for the dc-link voltage control of single-phase grid-connected converters (GCCs). For such controllers, the selection of the PI gains will lead to a tradeoff between two control objectives: 1) the reduction of the dc-link voltage fluctuations caused by random swings of the active power drawn by the single-phase GCC; and 2) the reduction of the grid current harmonics mainly caused by the 2f oscillation of the active power in single-phase applications. To solve this tradeoff, this paper presents a systematic approach for the design of an adaptive PI controller for the dc-link voltage control of single-phase GCCs. The proposed design approach is simple and it provides a convenient method to properly determine the adaptive PI controller parameters. Representative simulation and experimental results are presented and discussed in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed dc-link voltage controller.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a generic framework for a rectifier to continuously take part in the regulation of grid voltage and frequency is proposed. It can automatically change the power consumed to support the grid, without affecting the normal operation of the load. Such a rectifier has a built-in storage port, in addition to the normal ac and dc ports. The flexibility required by the ac port to support the grid is provided by the storage port without affecting the dc port. The grid support of the ac port is achieved through the recently proposed universal droop controller (UDC). A dc-bus voltage controller cascaded to the UDC is proposed to regulate the dc-bus voltage of the storage port within a wide range so as to provide the flexibility needed, while the dc-port voltage is maintained constant. An illustrative example is presented with the recently proposed &#x03b8;-converter, which consists of three ports with only four switches. Experimental results are provided to verify the capability of the rectifier to regulate the grid voltage and frequency without affecting the load.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the rapid development of deep learning, deep hashing methods have achieved promising results in efficient information retrieval. The hashing method maps similar data to binary hashcodes with smaller hamming distance, which has received broad attention due to its low storage cost and fast retrieval speed. Most of the existing deep hashing methods adopt pairwise or triplet losses to deal with similarities underlying the data, but their training is difficult and less efficient because  $O(n^{2})$  data pairs and  $O(n^{3})$  triplets are involved. To address these issues, we propose a novel deep hashing algorithm with the unary loss which can be trained very efficiently. First, we introduce a Unary Upper Bound of the traditional triplet loss, thus reducing the complexity to  $O(n)$  and bridging the classification-based unary loss and the triplet loss. Second, we propose a novel Semantic Cluster Deep Hashing (SCDH) algorithm by introducing a modified Unary Upper Bound loss, called Semantic Cluster Unary Loss. The resultant hashcodes form several compact clusters, which means the hashcodes in the same cluster have similar semantic information. We also demonstrate that the proposed SCDH is easy to extend to semi-supervised settings by incorporating the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning algorithms. The experiments on large-scale datasets show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art hashing algorithms.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Almost all conventional template-matching methods employ low-level image features to measure the similarity between a template image and a scene image using similarity measures, such as pixel intensity and pixel gradient. Although these methods have been widely used in many applications, they cannot simultaneously address all types of robustness challenges. In this paper, with the goal of simultaneously addressing the various challenges, we present a robust semantic template-matching (RSTM) approach. Inspired by the local binary descriptor, we propose a novel superpixel region binary descriptor (SRBD) to construct a multilevel semantic fusion feature vector for RSTM. SRBD uses a new kernel-distance-based simple linear iterative clustering method to extract the stable superpixels from the template image. Then, based on the average intensity difference between each superpixel region and its neighbors, the dominant gradient orientation of each superpixel can be obtained, and the semantic features of each superpixel can be described as the dominant orientation difference vector, which is coded as the rotation-invariant SRBD. In the offline matching phase, the fusion semantic feature vector of RSTM combines the multilevel SRBD features with different numbers of superpixels. In the online matching phase, to cope with rotation invariance, a marginal probability model is proposed and applied to locate the positions of template images in the scene image. Moreover, to accelerate computation, an image pyramid is employed. We conduct a series of experiments on a large dataset randomly selected from the MS COCO dataset to fully analyze the robustness of this approach. The experimental results show that RSTM simultaneously addresses rotation changes, scale changes, noise, occlusions, blur, nonlinear illumination changes, and deformation with high time efficiency while also outperforming the previous state-of-the-art template-matching methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The performance of salient object segmentation has been significantly advanced by using the deep convolutional networks. However, these networks often produce blob-like saliency maps without accurate object boundaries. This is caused by the limited spatial resolution of their feature maps after multiple pooling operations and might hinder downstream applications that require precise object shapes. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep model-Focal Boundary Guided (Focal-BG) network. Our model is designed to jointly learn to segment salient object masks and detect salient object boundaries. Our key idea is that additional knowledge about object boundaries can help to precisely identify the shape of the object. Moreover, our model incorporates a refinement pathway to refine the mask prediction and makes use of the focal loss to facilitate the learning of the hard boundary pixels. To evaluate our model, we conduct extensive experiments. Our Focal-BG network consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on five major benchmarks. We provide a detailed analysis of these results and demonstrate that our joint modeling of salient object boundary and mask helps to better capture the shape details, especially in the vicinity of object boundaries.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>As the problem of three-phase unbalance in a distribution network with distributed generations (DGs) is prominent, a multiobjective dynamic reconfiguration method for three-phase balance is proposed to make reconfiguration more reasonable and effective. Based on three-phase power flow calculation and reconfiguration process analysis of distribution networks with DGs, a new reconfiguration model with comprehensive optimization objectives of minimizing three-phase unbalance factor and number of switching times are established. A network connectivity discrimination method based on the algebraic connectivity of graph theory is adopted to quickly remove infeasible solutions, and a new multiobjective molecular differential evolution algorithm is designed to improve optimization depth and avoid prematurity in the optimization process, which is based on the principle of closer molecules with greater intermolecular repulsion. The multiobjective optimal dynamic reconfiguration of a modified IEEE 34-bus test feeder with DGs is carried out and the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, an output feedback finite-time control method is investigated for stabilizing the perturbed vehicle active suspension system to improve the suspension performance. Since physical suspension systems always exist in the phenomenon of uncertainty or external disturbance, a novel disturbance compensator with finite-time convergence performance is proposed for efficiently compensating the unknown external disturbance. Moreover, the presented compensator is advantageous over the existing ones since it is continuous and can completely remove the matched disturbance. From the viewpoint of practical implementation, continuous control law will not lead to chattering, which is desirable for electrical and mechanical systems. For the nominal suspension system without disturbance, a homogeneous controller with a simple filter is constructed to achieve a finite-time convergence property, where the filter is applied to obtain the unknown velocity signal. Thus, the nominal controller combines a disturbance compensator into an overall continuous control law, which provides two independent parts with a separate design unit and a high flexibility for selecting the control gains. According to the geometric homogeneity and finite-time separation principle, it can be shown that the active suspension is finite-time stabilized. A designed example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented controller for improving the vehicle ride performance.

<p>In actual production processes, the occurrence probability of multiple faults is much higher than that of a single fault, which will affect the process industry operating performance and final products quality. This paper is concerned with industrial practices and theoretical approaches for detection and location of key performance indicator (KPI) related multiple faults in process industries. First, a new KPI-related multiple fault monitoring scheme is addressed from the subprocess level based on the developed correlation-based canonical variable analysis model. Then, Bayesian fusion is implemented to form the final monitoring decisions from the plantwide level. After that, a tensor subspace analysis-based discriminant analysis method is proposed for locating the root causes, which will help field engineers to take correction actions and recover the process operations. Finally, the application to a typical industry process, i.e., hot strip mill process, is given to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed methods with real industrial data.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep computation, as an advanced machine learning model, has achieved the state-of-the-art performance for feature learning on big data in industrial Internet of Things (IoT). However, the current deep computation model usually suffers from overfitting due to the lack of public available labeled training samples, limiting its performance for big data feature learning. Motivated by the idea of active learning, an adaptive dropout deep computation model (ADDCM) with crowdsourcing to cloud is proposed for industrial IoT big data feature learning in this paper. First, a distribution function is designed to set the dropout rate for each hidden layer to prevent overfitting for the deep computation model. Furthermore, the outsourcing selection algorithm based on the maximum entropy is employed to choose appropriate samples from the training set to crowdsource on the cloud platform. Finally, an improved supervised learning from multiple experts scheme is presented to aggregate answers given by human workers and to update the parameters of the ADDCM simultaneously. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the presented model by comparing with the dropout deep computation model and other state-of-the-art crowdsourcing algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can prevent overfitting effectively and aggregate the labeled samples to train the parameters of the deep computation model with crowdsouring for industrial IoT big data feature learning.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, the fixed-time leader-following consensus problem is investigated for high-order multivariable multiagent systems with external disturbances. A new distributed observer is proposed for each follower under a directed information flow to estimate the leader state in a fixed time. Based on the observer, a novel tracking controller is designed such that the estimated leader state is tracked with disturbance rejection in a fixed time. Consensus conditions are established to guarantee the fixed-time stability. Different from some existing finite-/fixed-time consensus approaches, an explicit estimate for the upper bound of the settling time is derived, which provides additional system specification in advance. Moreover, for disturbance rejection, the chattering phenomenon is effectively reduced by using a distributed multivariable signum function. Finally, illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the theoretical results.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Time delays exist in network-connected systems. Especially for vision-based multirobot systems, time delays are diverse and complicated due to the communication network, camera latency, image processing, etc. At the same time, many tasks, such as searching and rescue, have timing requirement. This paper focuses on fixed-time formation control of multirobot systems subject to delay constraints. First, predictor-based state transformation is employed for each robot to deal with the input delay, and the uncertain terms remained in the transformed systems are carefully considered. Then, a couple of nonlinear fixed-time formation protocols are proposed for the multirobot systems with respectively undirected and directed topology, and the corresponding settling time is derived by using the Lyapunov functions. In particular, the upper-bound estimation of the formation settling time is explicitly given irrelevant to the initial conditions. Finally, the protocols are validated through a numerical simulation example and then implemented on an E-puck robots platform. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation protocols.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In practice, sensor precision degradation is ubiquitous and early detection of such a degradation is important for monitoring task. In this paper, a cumulative canonical correlation analysis (CCA) based sensor precision degradation detection method is presented in the Gaussian and non-Gaussian cases. At first, the fault sensitivity of the original CCA method to sensor precision degradation is theoretically analyzed. Then, the cumulative CCA-based method is proposed and delivers better fault detectability than the corresponding standard CCA-based method with respect to fault detection rate. For the non-Gaussian case, an efficient and practical applicable approach, referred as threshold learning approach, is proposed to set appropriate threshold based on available historical measurements. Finally, with the application to a real laboratorial continuous stirred tank heater plant, the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method are demonstrated by a comparison with the standard CCA-based and principal component analysis-based methods.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Digital reconstruction of mechanically shredded documents has received increasing attention in the last years mainly for historical and forensics needs. Computational methods to solve this problem are highly desirable in order to mitigate the time-consuming human effort and to preserve document integrity. The reconstruction of strips-shredded documents is accomplished by horizontally splicing pieces so that the arising sequence (solution) is as similar as the original document. In this context, a central issue is the quantification of the fitting between the pieces (strips), which generally involves stating a function that associates a pair of strips to a real value indicating the fitting quality. This problem is also more challenging for text documents, such as business letters or legal documents, since they depict poor color information. The system proposed here addresses this issue by exploring character shapes as visual features for compatibility computation. Experiments conducted with real mechanically shredded documents showed that our approach outperformed in accuracy other popular techniques in the literature considering documents with (almost) only textual content.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The connected vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) and cloud computing technology allows entities in VANET to enjoy the advantageous storage and computing services offered by some cloud service provider. However, the advantages do not come free, since their combination brings many new security and privacy requirements for VANET applications. In this paper, we investigate the cloud-based road condition monitoring (RCoM) scenario, where the authority needs to monitor real-time road conditions with the help of a cloud server so that it could make sound responses to emergency cases timely. When some bad road condition is detected, e.g., some geologic hazard or accident happens, vehicles on site are able to report such information to a cloud server engaged by the authority. We focus on addressing three key issues in RCoM. First, the vehicles have to be authorized by some roadside unit before generating a road condition report in the domain and uploading it to the cloud server. Second, to guarantee the privacy against the cloud server, the road condition information should be reported in ciphertext format, which requires that the cloud server should be able to distinguish the reported data from different vehicles in ciphertext format for the same place without compromising their confidentiality. Third, the cloud server and authority should be able to validate the report source, i.e., to check whether the road conditions are reported by legitimate vehicles. To address these issues, we present an efficient RCoM scheme, analyze its efficiency theoretically, and demonstrate the practicality through experiments.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The task of Heterogeneous Face Recognition consists in matching face images that are sensed in different domains, such as sketches to photographs (visual spectra images), and thermal images to photographs or near-infrared images to photographs. In this paper, we suggest that the high-level features of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks trained in visual spectra images are potentially domain independent and can be used to encode faces sensed in different image domains. A generic framework for Heterogeneous Face Recognition is proposed by adapting Deep Convolutional Neural Networks low-level features in, so-called, Domain Specific Units. The adaptation using the Domain Specific Units allows the learning of shallow feature detectors specific for each new image domain. Furthermore, it handles its transformation to a generic face space shared between all image domains. Experiments carried out with four different face databases covering three different image domains show substantial improvements, in terms of recognition rate, surpassing the state-of-the-art for most of them. This work is made reproducible: all the source code, scores, and trained models of this approach are made publicly available.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Natural images often contain patches with high similarity. In this paper, to effectively utilize the local and nonlocal self-similarity for low-rank models, we propose a novel weighted tensor rank-1 decomposition method (termed as WTR1) for nonlocal image denoising. Although the low-rank approximation problem has been well studied for matrices, it remains elusive of the theoretical extension to tensors due to the NP-hard tensor decomposition. To tackle this problem, the proposed WTR1 method designs a new efficient CANDECOMP/ PARAFAC (CP) decomposition algorithm and constructs a straightforward low-rank tensor approximation strategy. This is achieved by elegantly manipulating the CP-rank, called intrinsic low-rank tensor approximation. Specifically, the WTR1 method first groups similar patches into a 3D stack and converts the stack into a finite sum of rank-1 products. Then, we deploy the intrinsic low-rank tensor approximation to produce the final denoised image. The proposed WTR1 method can jointly exploit the local and nonlocal self-similarity, thus improving the nonlocal image denoising quality. Experimental results have shown that the proposed WTR1 outperforms several state-of-the-art denoising methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Hypergraph learning has been widely exploited in various image processing applications, due to its advantages in modeling the high-order information. Its efficacy highly depends on building an informative hypergraph structure to accurately and robustly formulate the underlying data correlation. However, the existing hypergraph learning methods are sensitive to non-Gaussian noise, which hurts the corresponding performance. In this paper, we present a noise-resistant hypergraph learning model, which provides superior robustness against various non-Gaussian noises. In particular, our model adopts low-rank representation to construct a hypergraph, which captures the globally linear data structure as well as preserving the grouping effect of highly correlated data. We further introduce a correntropy-induced local metric to measure the reconstruction errors, which is particularly robust to non-Gaussian noises. Finally, the Frobenious-norm-based regularization is proposed to combine with the low-rank regularizer, which enables our model to regularize the singular values of the coefficient matrix. By such, the non-zero coefficients are selected to generate a hyperedge set as well as the hyperedge weights. We have evaluated the proposed hypergraph model in the tasks of image clustering and semi-supervised image classification. Quantitatively, our scheme significantly enhances the performance of the state-of-the-art hypergraph models on several benchmark data sets.
