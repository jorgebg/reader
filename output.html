<div class="itemdescription">
<p><span class="paragraphSection">Over the past decade, nutritional psychiatry has developed into a promising research area in a field with great unmet need. The early research has advanced from cross-sectional epidemiological studies reporting associations between diet quality and mental health outcomes, including depression and anxiety, to longitudinal and mechanistic studies. Observational findings have been extensively replicated and documented in meta-analyses and are supported by intervention studies examining the efficacy of dietary improvement as a treatment for depression; recently, 2 preliminary trials of dietary interventions for depression have yielded similar positive findings. A new meta-analysis confirms that dietary interventions significantly reduce depressive symptoms, although nearly all studies to date have involved nonclinically depressed populations; that is, individuals with subsyndromal depressive symptoms, metabolic disorders, other somatic conditions, or healthy adults recruited from the general population. Thus, for the findings from these studies to serve as catalysts for clinical change, additional independent and methodologically rigorous interventions targeting depression are essential. In this issue of <span style="font-style: italic;">JAMA</span>, 2 randomized trials provide important results that focus on the emerging field of nutritional psychiatry.</span>

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this work, the design of a novel the flexure-linked dual-drive H-gantry is first introduced. Compared to conventional stacked X&#x2013;Y tables, the advantages of this gantry are on decoupled X&#x2013;Y actuation, better mechanical reliability, larger driving force, and shorter response time. However, after deriving its reduced-order dynamical model, it is found that the precision of the end-effector is significantly affected by the position dependent torque caused by the inter-parallel-axes driving forces on the fixed inertia frame and coupling forces from the pair of flexures. These form barriers that limit precision positioning and tracking performance over a large workspace. Thus, in the following part, a robust integral of signum of error (RISE) control with novel jerk adaptation is proposed on top of the standard proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and feedforward scheme. Compared with some prior RISE schemes with gain adaptation, the proposed scheme yields bounded robust gain in the presence of noisy velocity estimation. Real-time experiments on the actual testbed indicate that both improvement of motion precision and prevention of resonant mode excitation over a large workspace are successfully achieved in the proposed scheme.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Despite the recent advances on intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings, existing research works mostly assume training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution. However, due to variation of operating condition, domain shift phenomenon generally exists, which results in significant diagnosis performance deterioration. To address cross-domain problems, latest research works preferably apply domain adaptation techniques on marginal data distributions. However, it is usually assumed that sufficient testing data are available for training, that is not in accordance with most transfer tasks in real industries where only data in machine healthy condition can be collected in advance. This paper proposes a novel cross-domain fault diagnosis method based on deep generative neural networks. By artificially generating fake samples for domain adaptation, the proposed method is able to provide reliable cross-domain diagnosis results when testing data in machine fault conditions are not available for training. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method offers a promising approach for industrial applications.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>AC cascaded system is one of the basic components of the power conversion system in the modern more-electric aircraft (MEA). However, the ac cascaded system suffers from an instability problem, i.e., even if each subsystem is stable individually, the formed cascaded system may become unstable. Most of the existing stabilization methods are a linear control method, which is based on a small signal model and can only ensure small signal stability near the operation point in theory. Therefore, these existing linear stabilization methods may be ineffective to fix large-signal stability issues. In this paper, a large signal stability constraining dichotomy solution (SCDS)-based model predictive control (MPC) is proposed to improve the stability of the ac cascaded system in the MEA by the Lyapunov criteria. This approach first theoretically presents how to add the system stability item to the MPC cost function in an analytic way instead of using the traditional &#x201c;experience-based&#x201d; weight method. Besides, the SCDS-MPC itself is also an improvement to the existing finite control set MPC. It can realize a constant switching frequency and achieve better steady-state&#x002f;dynamic current control performance. Finally, a 1.5 kW ac cascaded system is fabricated in the laboratory to verify the proposed SCDS-MPC method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Accurate estimation of power capacity is critical to ensure battery safety margins and optimize energy utilization. Power capacity estimators based on online identified equivalent circuit model have been widely investigated due to the high accuracy and affordable computing cost. However, the impact of noise corruption which is common in practice on such estimators has never been investigated. This paper scrutinizes the effect of noises on model identification, state of charge (SOC) and power capacity estimation. An online model identification method based on adaptive forgetting recursive total least squares (AF-RTLS) is proposed to compensate the noise effect and attenuate the identification bias of model parameters. A Luenberger observer is further used in combination with the AF-RTLS to estimate the SOC in real time. Leveraging the estimated model parameters and SOC, a multiconstraint analytical method is proposed to online estimate the power capacity. Simulation and experimental results verify that the proposed method is superior in terms of estimation accuracy and the robustness to noise corruption.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fractional interpolation is used to provide sub-pixel level references for motion compensation in the interprediction of video coding, which attempts to remove temporal redundancy in video sequences. Traditional handcrafted fractional interpolation filters face the challenge of modeling discontinuous regions in videos, while existing deep learning-based methods are either designed for a single quantization parameter (QP), only generating half-pixel samples, or need to train a model for each sub-pixel position. In this paper, we present a one-for-all fractional interpolation method based on a grouped variation convolutional neural network (GVCNN). Our method can deal with video frames coded using different QPs and is capable of generating all sub-pixel positions at one sub-pixel level. Also, by predicting variations between integer-position pixels and sub-pixels, our network offers more expressive power. Moreover, we perform specific measurements in training data generation to simulate practical situations in video coding, including blurring the down-sampled sub-pixel samples to avoid aliasing effects and coding integer pixels to simulate reconstruction errors. In addition, we analyze the impact of the size of blur kernels theoretically. Experimental results verify the efficiency of GVCNN. Compared with HEVC, our method achieves 2.2% in bit saving on average and up to 5.2% under low-delay P configuration.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel screen-shooting resilient watermarking scheme, which means that if the watermarked image is displayed on the screen and the screen information is captured by the camera, we can still extract the watermark message from the captured photo. To realize such demands, we analyzed the special distortions caused by the screen-shooting process, including lens distortion, light source distortion, and moir&#x00e9; distortion. To resist the geometric deformation caused by lens distortion, we proposed an intensity-based scale-invariant feature transform (I-SIFT) algorithm which can accurately locate the embedding regions. As for the loss of image details caused by light source distortion and moir&#x00e9; distortion, we put forward a small-size template algorithm to repeatedly embed the watermark into different regions, so that at least one complete information region can survive from distortions. At the extraction side, we designed a cross-validation-based extraction algorithm to cope with repeated embedding. The validity and correctness of the extraction method are verified by hypothesis testing. Furthermore, to boost the extraction speed, we proposed a SIFT feature editing algorithm to enhance the intensity of the keypoints, based on which, the extraction accuracy and extraction speed can be greatly improved. The experimental results show that the proposed watermarking scheme achieves high robustness for screen-shooting process. Compared with the previous schemes, our algorithm provides significant improvement in robustness for screen-shooting process and extraction efficiency.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Video watermarking is a well-established technology to help identify digital pirates when they illegally re-distribute multimedia content. In order to provide every client with a unique, watermarked video, the traditional distribution architectures separately encode each watermarked video. However, since these encodings require a high amount of computational resources, such architectures do not scale well to a large number of users. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel architecture that uses fast encoders instead of traditional, full encoders. The fast encoders re-use the coding information from a single, previously-encoded, unwatermarked video in order to speed up the encodings of the watermarked videos. As a result, the complexity of a fast encoder is only a fraction of the complexity of a full encoder. Due to a high correlation of the re-used coding information with the optimal coding information, the compression efficiency and watermark robustness decrease only slightly. Most importantly, the proposed fast encoder speeds up the compression process with a factor of 115, resulting in a low complexity similar to that of a video decoder. Consequently, video distributors can use the proposed architecture to deliver high-quality watermarked videos on a large-scale without requiring an excessive amount of computational resources.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Because of the dynamic nature of network traffic patterns, such as new traffic application arrivals or flash events, it is becoming increasingly difficult for conventional anomaly detection systems to separate various applications based on their traffic patterns. In this paper, by leveraging transport layer packet-level and flow-level features, new structures called application fingerprints are generated, which express such features in a compact and efficient manner. Based on the generated fingerprints, we propose a novel traffic classification framework. The proposed system generates profiles of normal applications using a multi-modal probability distribution. The proposed classification framework is then extended to detect distributed denial of service attacks from the collected statistical information at flow level. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system, we evaluate its performance using five real-world traffic datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method is capable of achieving an accuracy of over 97&#x0025;, whereas the misclassification rate is only 2.5&#x0025;.

<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) botnets have become one of the major threats in network security for serving as the fundamental infrastructure for various cyber-crimes. More challenges are involved in the problem of detecting P2P botnets, despite a few work claimed to detect centralized botnets effectively. We propose an enhanced PeerHunter, a network-flow level community behavior analysis based system, to detect P2P botnets. Our system starts from a P2P network flow detection component. Then, it uses &#x201c;mutual contacts&#x201d; to cluster bots into communities. Finally, it uses network-flow level community behavior analysis to detect potential botnets. In the experimental evaluation, we propose two evasion attacks, where we assume the adversaries know our techniques in advance and attempt to evade our system by making the P2P bots mimic the behavior of legitimate P2P applications. Our results showed that enhanced PeerHunter can obtain high detection rate with few false positives, and high robustness against the proposed attacks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Despite the benefits of cyber-insurance, organizations are reluctant to enroll in such policies mainly because of their limitation and high price. On the other hand, insurers are confronting the adverse selection and moral hazard problems as monitoring and distinguishing insureds&#x2019; cybersecurity posture are highly complicated. Considering the organizations&#x2019; security interdependency and their demand for cyber-insurance, we study the design of coalitional insurance mechanisms with the goal of covering the adverse selection, moral hazard, and motivating players for cybersecurity investment and information sharing. To this end, we propose a synergistic insurance framework, where organizations collaboratively insure a common platform instead of themselves. We present three models for insuring a common platform. In the first model, organizations act as both insurer and insured to distribute the risk in the coalition. In the second model, the system provides rewards to crowdfund the insurance. Finally, in the third model, we investigate the outsourcing of a common platform insurance. Furthermore, we discuss how our proposed mechanisms for such framework satisfy the budget balanced, ex ante individual rationality, and incentive compatibility properties. We study how such a system can improve the social welfare by leveraging cyber-insurance as a motivation for organizations to cooperate on the cybersecurity investment and information sharing.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the development of data collection techniques, multi-view clustering becomes an emerging research direction to improve the clustering performance. This paper has shown that leveraging multi-view information is able to provide a rich and comprehensive description. One of the core problems is how to sufficiently represent multi-view data in the analysis. In this paper, we introduce a tensor-based representation learning method for multi-view clustering (tRLMvC) that can unify heterogeneous and high-dimensional multi-view feature spaces to a low-dimensional shared latent feature space and improve multi-view clustering performance. To sufficiently capture plenty multi-view information, the tRLMvC represents multi-view data as a third-order tensor, expresses each tensorial data point as a sparse  $t$ -linear combination of all data points with  $t$ -product, and constructs a self-expressive tensor through reconstruction coefficients. The low-dimensional multi-view data representation in the shared latent feature space can be obtained via Tucker decomposition on the self-expressive tensor. These two parts are iteratively performed so that the interaction between self-expressive tensor learning and its factorization can be enhanced and the new representation can be effectively generated for clustering purpose. We conduct extensive experiments on eight multi-view data sets and compare the proposed model with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results have shown that tRLMvC outperforms the baselines in terms of various evaluation metrics.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) is changing the way modern information systems that are designed, operated, and evolved. SOC makes possible to aggregate distributed resources at the phases of decision-making support and system operations. When myriads of resources with similar functionalities are available, effective methodologies are demanded to select services and compose them as service workflows for the specified goals. The computation for workflow composition is very complex since it depends on the numbers of services and their dynamic characteristics. Therefore, composing optimized workflows in a timely manner poses a great challenge. We are highly motivated to reduce the complexity of service selection and composition. The formalized semantics in SWSpec is extended so that unqualified or inferior services can be eliminated directly from the scope of the design solution space. In this paper, a brief review of the proposed SWSpec language is given and the focus is on the sematic formalization. A new compositional proof-system is developed with a set of inference rules and the proven system properties. The proposed semantic formalization has its great significance in reducing the complexity of composing workflows and developing efficient algorithms for compliance checking.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) would significantly increase the overall electrical load demand in power distribution networks. Hence, there is a need for comprehensive planning of charging infrastructure in order to prevent power failures or scenarios where there is a considerable demand&#x2013;supply mismatch. Accurately predicting the realistic charging demand of EVs is an essential part of the infrastructure planning. Charging demand of EVs is influenced by several factors, such as driver behavior, location of charging stations, electricity pricing, etc. In order to implement an optimal charging infrastructure, it is important to consider all the relevant factors that influence the charging demand of EVs. Several studies have modeled and simulated the charging demands of individual and groups of EVs. However, in many cases, the models do not consider factors related to the social characteristics of EV drivers. Other studies do not emphasize on economic elements. This paper aims at evaluating the effects of the above factors on EV charging demand using a simulation model. An agent-based approach using NetLogo is employed in this paper to closely mimic the human aggregate behavior and its influence on the load demand due to charging of EVs.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Uncertainty management is a challenging task in decision making of the operators of the power systems. Prediction of the system state is vital for the operation of a system with stochastic behavior especially in a power system with a significant amount of renewable energies such as wind power. Predictable power systems are in more interest of operators, of course. This paper proposes a multiobjective framework for optimal placement and parameters setting of a unified power flow controller (UPFC) considering system predictability. The well-known multiobjective nondominated sorting genetic algorithm is implemented to handle various objective functions such as active power losses and predictability of system in the presence of operational constraints and uncertainties. The point estimate method is used for modeling probabilistic nature of the wind power. Using the proposed method, statistical information of voltage magnitude and apparent power of converters of UPFCs can be obtained, which are very useful in making decision on the sizing of UPFCs. Comprehensive discussions are provided using the simulations on the IEEE 57-bus test system. Also, in order to validate the obtained results, a multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm is implemented and the results of two algorithms are compared with each other.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation is a technique that is being used increasingly in the development and test of complex systems. Real-world testing of an intricate system in a field-like power plant can be challenging, time-consuming, expensive, and hazardous. HIL emulators allow engineers to test devices thoroughly and efficiently in a virtual environment with high reliability and minimum risk of defect. In this paper, the complete electric power system (including generator, turbine-governor, excitation system, transmission lines, transformer, external grid and related loads) is implemented in a MATLAB&#x002f;Simulink environment. Different virtual instrument pages are modeled in the graphical programming language of LabVIEW which enable fast and reliable measurement functions such as data acquisition, archiving, real-time graphical display and processing. The interaction between MATLAB and LabVIEW is accomplished by generating a Pharlap ETS Targets <sup>&#x002a;</sup>.dll file which enables the two software to exchange real-time data. Also, a real 1518-kW excitation system is considered as a test case for the introduced HIL system. This equipment is connected to LabVIEW software through a National Instrument PXI technology. Different scenarios (electrical frequency&#x002f;active power change, voltage step response, etc.) are simulated in the designed power system emulator (PSE). The validity of the implemented model for the excitation system is verified by finding good matching between MATLAB and HIL simulation results.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are considered as a promising solution in intravehicle networking to reduce wiring and production costs. This application requires reliable and real-time data delivery, while the network is very dense. The time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) mode of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard provides a reliable solution for low-power networks through guaranteed medium access and channel diversity. However, satisfying the stringent requirements of in-vehicle networks is challenging and demands for special consideration in network formation and TSCH scheduling. This paper targets convergecast in dense in-vehicle WSNs, in which all nodes can potentially directly reach the sink node. A cross-layer low-latency topology management and TSCH scheduling (LLTT) technique is proposed that provides a very high timeslot utilization for the TSCH schedule and minimizes communication latency. It first picks a topology for the network that increases the potential of parallel TSCH communications. Then, by using an optimized graph isomorphism algorithm, it extracts a proper match in the physical connectivity graph of the network for the selected topology. This network topology is used by a lightweight TSCH schedule generator to provide low data delivery latency. Two techniques, namely grouped retransmission and periodic aggregation, are exploited to increase the performance of the TSCH communications. The experimental results show that LLTT reduces the end-to-end communication latency compared to other approaches, while keeping the communications reliable by using dedicated links and grouped retransmissions.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Using multi-atlas registration (MAR), information carried by atlases can be transferred onto a new input image for the tasks of region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation, anatomical landmark detection, and so on. Conventional atlases used in MAR methods are monomodal and contain only normal anatomical structures. Therefore, the majority of MAR methods cannot handle input multimodal pathological images, which are often collected in routine image-based diagnosis. This is because registering monomodal atlases with normal appearances to multimodal pathological images involves two major problems: 1) missing imaging modalities in the monomodal atlases and 2) influence from pathological regions. In this paper, we propose a new MAR framework to tackle these problems. In this framework, deep learning-based image synthesizers are applied for synthesizing multimodal normal atlases from conventional monomodal normal atlases. To reduce the influence from pathological regions, we further propose a multimodal low-rank approach to recover multimodal normal-looking images from multimodal pathological images. Finally, the multimodal normal atlases can be registered to the recovered multimodal images in a multi-channel way. We evaluate our MAR framework via brain ROI segmentation of multimodal tumor brain images. Due to the utilization of multimodal information and the reduced influence from pathological regions, experimental results show that registration based on our method is more accurate and robust, leading to significantly improved brain ROI segmentation compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Stereoscopic saliency detection plays an important role in various stereoscopic video processing applications. However, conventional stereoscopic video saliency detection methods mainly use independent low-level features instead of extracting them automatically, and thus, they ignore the intrinsic relationship between the spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel stereoscopic video saliency detection method based on 3D convolutional neural networks, namely, deep 3D video saliency (Deep3DSaliency). The proposed network consists of two sub-models: spatiotemporal saliency model (STSM) and stereoscopic saliency aware model (SSAM). STSM directly takes three consecutive video frames as the input to extract visual spatiotemporal features, while SSAM attempts to further infer the depth and semantic features from the left and right video frames by shared parameters from STSM. The visual spatiotemporal features from STSM and the depth and semantic features from SSAM are learned by an alternating optimization scheme. Finally, all these saliency-related features are combined together for the final stereoscopic saliency detection via 3D deconvolution. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed model over other existing ones in saliency estimation for 3D video sequences.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The 360&#x00b0; video compression has two main challenges due to projection distortions, namely, the geometry distortion and the face boundary discontinuity. There are some tradeoffs between selecting equi-rectangular projection (ERP) and polyhedron projection. In ERP, the geometry distortion is severer than the face boundary discontinuity; while for the polyhedron projections, the face boundary discontinuity is severer than the geometry distortion. These two distortions will have side effects on the motion compensation and undermine the compression efficiency of the 360&#x00b0; video. In this paper, an integrated framework is developed to handle these two problems to improve coding efficiency. The proposed framework mainly has two key contributions. First, we derive a unified advanced spherical motion model to handle the geometry distortion of different projection formats for the 360&#x00b0; video. When fitting the projection between the various projection formats and the sphere into the unified framework, a specific solution can be obtained for each projection format. Second, we propose a local 3D padding method to handle the face boundary discontinuity between the neighboring faces in various projection formats of the 360&#x00b0; video. The local 3D padding method can be applied to different projection formats through setting different angles between neighboring faces. These two methods are independent of each other and can also be combined into an integrated framework to achieve a better rate-distortion performance. The proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into the latest video coding standard high-efficiency video coding. The experimental results demonstrate that introducing proposed coding tools can achieve significant bitrate savings compared with the current state-of-the-art method.
