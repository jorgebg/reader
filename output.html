<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In Reply In response to Dr Finucane&#8217;s query about our presentation on the risks and benefits of intensive glucose control, we would like to point out that we do not advocate intensive glucose control in the perioperative period. We have, in fact, alluded to studies showing the potential harm of intensive glucose control in the intraoperative period, and throughout the Clinical Update, we advocated for a target blood glucose of less than 180 mg/dL and avoidance of hypoglycemia. Our comment that &#8220;good&#8221; (not intensive) glucose control is likely to be beneficial was based on a meta-analysis by Sathya et al, which showed reduced postoperative mortality (odds ratio, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.24-0.76]) and stroke (odds ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.38-0.98]) when the perioperative glycemic target was 150 to 200 mg/dL compared with greater than 200 mg/dL.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents linear-fractional-trans-formation (LFT)-structured uncertainty state-space modeling for robust control of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ultra-precision wafer stage with flexible structures to meet the challenges of vibration-dependent model uncertainties. Specifically, based on the modal MIMO state-space model, a parametric uncertainty model related with flexible modes is presented, and the uncertainty parameters are structured to a diagonal matrix with the LFT method. Meanwhile, a multiplicative uncertainty model is employed to express the uncertainty in high frequency with respect to ignored high-order modes. Thus, the final uncertainty model is structured with uncertainty parameters and high-frequency uncertainty. Based on the proposed uncertainty model, a comprehensive robust control scheme is proposed. Specifically, the weighting function matrixes are designed by the loop-shaping approach, and a $mu$ analysis is employed to achieve a nonconservative solution with respect to the structured uncertainty. A standard stability criterion of a $bf{M} boldsymbol{Delta}$ structure system is then utilized to determine the system stability by the largest structure singular value. Comparative experiments on a developed ultra-precision wafer stage are finally conducted, and the results validate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements on control performance, robustness, and robust stability in all exposure fields.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Energy imbalance market (EIM) provides an opportunity that allows larger shares of variable renewable energy sources in the grid. Under highly volatile weather conditions, an accurate forecasting of photovoltaic (PV) power is necessary for grid stability and market operation. Most of existing forecasting methods strongly rely on the accuracy of measurements, and the adaptability of these methods to complex weather conditions is rarely discussed. In this paper, a weather classification multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) forecasting model is introduced for complex weather conditions in all seasons. It can be updated incrementally and its high computational efficiency satisfies EIM operations. A data set that consists of the historical power and meteorological parameters produced by a small-scale PV platform is classified and used to train MARS models with forecast horizons ranging from 15 min to 24 h in different seasons. The tests and analyses results indicate higher accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency of the novel model.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents the design and experimental validation of disturbance observer (DO)-based control for grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) inverters fed by a dc&#x2013;dc boost converter considering unbalanced grid voltages. The control scheme uses multiples controllers that are developed based on employing DO technique along with a feedback-linearizing (FBL) control. The main controller is designed to regulate the active and reactive powers injected into the grid via controlling the grid-tied inverter. Under unbalanced grid voltages, the active and reactive power is composed of a dc component as well as an ac component that oscillates at twice the grid frequency. Therefore, the unknown perturbation, representing the mismatch between the nominal and actual system, can be treated as a sum of a constant offset and a sinusoidal disturbance. To ensure accurate control of the active/reactive power, a DO is designed to estimate the unknown perturbation, which is then canceled by a FBL control. By considering the control input limitation in the observer synthesis, an antiwindup compensator arises naturally in the control law, which attenuates the effect of the windup phenomenon during control saturation. Moreover, a simplified representation of the DO is proposed to facilitate real-time implementation. The proposed approach for the power control can be used in both balanced and unbalanced systems since it can reject constant and sinusoidal disturbances. Experimental tests were performed to investigate the ability of the proposed control scheme to achieve good transient and steady-state performances.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a two-degrees-of-freedom control algorithm based on uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE), aimed to minimize the total harmonic distortion of inverter output voltage is proposed, possessing enhanced robustness to fundamental frequency variations. A multiple-time-delay action is combined with a commonly utilized low-pass UDE filter to increase the range of output impedance magnitude minimization around odd multiples of fundamental frequency for enhanced rejection of typical single-phase nonlinear loads harmonics. Marginal robustness improvement achieved by increasing the number of time delays is quantified analytically and revealed to be independent of delay order. The performance of the proposed control approach and its superiority over two recently proposed methods is validated successfully by experimental results.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper introduces a novel self-tuned perturb and observe (SPO) algorithm for quick maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and a novel maximize-M Kalman filter (MMKF)-based control technique for optimal operation of grid-integrated solar photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion system, where linear&#x002f;nonlinear loads are attached at point of common coupling (PCC). The proposed SPO is the improved form of perturb and observe (P&amp;O) algorithm, where inherent problems of traditional P&amp;O such as steady-state oscillation, slow dynamic responses, and fixed step size issues, are successfully mitigated. Therefore, SPO tracks maximum power peak (MPP) very rapidly, and it very accurately extracts maximum power from the PV array. The extracted power is used to meet the active power requirement of loads, and after meeting the load demand, the excess power is supplied to the grid. During power feeding, the power quality and power management are maintained by the MMKF-based control technique. In control strategy, the MMKF is used for fundamental harmonic component extraction from the grid voltage and load current, even when the grid voltage is characterized by adverse situations, such as sag, swell, harmonic distortion, dc offset, etc. Here, the SPO MPPT algorithm and MMKF-based control techniques are tested on a developed prototype. The efficient and reliable performances of SPO MPPT algorithm and MMKF-based control algorithm, in dynamic as well as in steady-state condition, are demonstrated under insolation variation conditions, nonlinear loading, as well as in different grid disturbances such as overvoltage, undervoltage, phase imbalance, harmonics distortion in the grid voltage, etc.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Filtering images of more than one channel are challenging in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. By grouping similar patches to utilize the self-similarity and sparse linear approximation of natural images, recent nonlocal and transform-domain methods have been widely used in color and multispectral image (MSI) denoising. Many related methods focus on the modeling of group level correlation to enhance sparsity, which often resorts to a recursive strategy with a large number of similar patches. The importance of the patch level representation is understated. In this paper, we mainly investigate the influence and potential of representation at patch level by considering a general formulation with a block diagonal matrix. We further show that by training a proper global patch basis, along with a local principal component analysis transform in the grouping dimension, a simple transform-threshold-inverse method could produce very competitive results. Fast implementation is also developed to reduce the computational complexity. The extensive experiments on both the simulated and real datasets demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness, and efficiency.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose and develop a novel nonlocal variational technique based on structural similarity (SS) information for image restoration problems. In the literature, patches extracted from images are compared according to their pixel values, and then nonlocal filtering can be employed for image restoration. The disadvantage of this approach is that intensity-based patch distance may not be effective in image restoration, especially for images containing texture or structural information. The main aim of this paper is to propose using SS between image patches to develop nonlocal regularization models. In particular, two types of nonlocal regularizing functions are studied: an SS-based nonlocal quadratic function (SS-NLH1) and an SS-based nonlocal total variation function (SS-NLTV) for regularization of image restoration problems. Moreover, we employ iterative algorithms to solve these SS-NLH1 and SS-NLTV variational models numerically and discuss the convergence of these algorithms. The experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Capturing images at high ISO modes will introduce much realistic noise, which is difficult to be removed by traditional denoising methods. In this paper, we propose a novel denoising method for high ISO JPEG images via deep fusion of collaborative and convolutional filtering. Collaborative filtering explores the non-local similarity of natural images, while convolutional filtering takes advantage of the large capacity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to infer noise from noisy images. We observe that the noise variance map of a high ISO JPEG image is spatial-dependent and has a Bayer-like pattern. Therefore, we introduce the Bayer pattern prior in our noise estimation and collaborative filtering stages. Since collaborative filtering is good at recovering repeatable structures and convolutional filtering is good at recovering irregular patterns and removing noise in flat regions, we propose to fuse the strengths of the two methods via deep CNN. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art realistic noise removal methods for a wide variety of testing images in both subjective and objective measurements. In addition, we construct a dataset with noisy and clean image pairs for high ISO JPEG images to facilitate research on this topic.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Camera sensors often fail to capture clear images or videos in a poorly lit environment. In this paper, we propose a trainable hybrid network to enhance the visibility of such degraded images. The proposed network consists of two distinct streams to simultaneously learn the global content and the salient structures of the clear image in a unified network. More specifically, the content stream estimates the global content of the low-light input through an encoder&#x2013;decoder network. However, the encoder in the content stream tends to lose some structure details. To remedy this, we propose a novel spatially variant recurrent neural network (RNN) as an edge stream to model edge details, with the guidance of another auto-encoder. The experimental results show that the proposed network favorably performs against the state-of-the-art low-light image enhancement algorithms.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Multi-illuminant-based color constancy (MCC) is quite a challenging task. In this paper, we proposed a novel model motivated by the bottom-up and top-down mechanisms of human visual system (HVS) to estimate the spatially varying illumination in a scene. The motivation for bottom-up based estimation is from our finding that the bright and dark parts in a scene play different roles in encoding illuminants. However, handling the color shift of large colorful objects is difficult using pure bottom-up processing. Thus, we further introduce a top-down constraint inspired by the findings in visual psychophysics, in which high-level information (e.g., the prior of light source colors) plays a key role in visual color constancy. In order to implement the top-down hypothesis, we simply learn a color mapping between the illuminant distribution estimated by bottom-up processing and the ground truth maps provided by the dataset. We evaluated our model on four datasets and the results show that our method obtains very competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art MCC algorithms. Moreover, the robustness of our model is more tangible considering that our results were obtained using the same parameters for all the datasets or the parameters of our model were learned from the inputs, that is, mimicking how HVS operates. We also show the color correction results on some real-world images taken from the web.

<p>The previous blockchain data transmission techniques in industrial Internet of Things (IoT) have low security, high management cost of the trading center, and big difficulty in supervision. To address these issues, this paper proposes a secure FaBric blockchain-based data transmission technique for industrial IoT. This technique uses the blockchain-based dynamic secret sharing mechanism. A reliable trading center is realized using the power blockchain sharing model, which can also share power trading books. The power data consensus mechanism and dynamic linked storage are designed to realize the secure matching of the power data transmission. Experiments show that the optimized FaBric power data storage and transmission has high security and reliability. The proposed technique can improve the transmission rate and packet receiving rate by 12% and 13%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed technique has good superiority in sharing management and decentralization.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Vehicular energy network (VEN), as an important part of the Internet of Things for the smart city, can facilitate the renewable energy (RE) transportation over a large geographical area by means of electric vehicles (EVs) through wireless power transfer technology. However, due to the potential security vulnerability in VEN, EV users can be attacked by external or internal adversaries. In addition, owing to the selfishness of EVs, it is a great challenge to optimally schedule the charging/discharging behaviors of EVs to realize regional energy balance in VEN. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based secure incentive scheme for energy delivery in VEN. First, a novel permissioned energy blockchain system is introduced in VEN to implement secure energy delivery services for EVs and energy nodes through the use of distributed ledgers and cryptocurrency. Second, a proof of reputation consensus protocol is proposed to efficiently reach consensus in energy blockchain, where the reputation derivation is constructed based on the local trust computing and credibility computing. Third, motivated by the pricing mechanism, an incentive model is developed to stimulate EVs to cooperatively deliver RE to various areas with different electricity loads while maximizing EVs' utilities. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided, which demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme through the comparison with conventional schemes.

A third of asylum seekers and over 40% of refugees are estimated to be victims of torture.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Spectrum auction is an effective approach to improve the spectrum utilization, by leasing an idle spectrum from primary users to secondary users. Recently, a few differentially private spectrum auction mechanisms have been proposed, but, as far as we know, none of them addressed the differential privacy in the setting of double spectrum auctions. In this paper, we combine the concept of differential privacy with double spectrum auction design and present a differentially private double spectrum auction mechanism with approximate social welfare maximization (DDSM). Specifically, we design the mechanism by employing the exponential mechanism to select clearing prices for the double spectrum auction with probabilities exponentially proportional to the related social welfare values and then improve the mechanism in several aspects, such as the designs of the auction algorithm, the utility function, and the buyer grouping algorithm. Through theoretical analysis, we prove that DDSM achieves differential privacy, approximate truthfulness, and approximate social welfare maximization. Extensive experimental evaluations show that DDSM achieves a good performance in terms of social welfare.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Microphone recognition aims at recognizing different microphones based on the recorded speeches. In the literature, Gaussian Supervector (GSV) has been used as the feature vector representing a speech recording, which is obtained by adapting a universal background model (UBM). However, it is not clear how the performance of the GSV will be affected by the number of mixture components in the UBM. Besides, the raw GSV obtained from a speech recording contains both the microphone response information and the speech information, meaning that the raw GSV can be quite noisy as the feature vector for microphone recognition. In this paper, we investigate how GSV will be affected by the UBM and other parameters during the calculation of the GSV. In addition, in order to improve the quality of the raw GSV, we propose a kernel-based projection method to be applied to the raw GSV. This projection method maps the raw GSV onto another dimensional space. It is expected that in the projected feature space, the microphone response information and the speech information can be separated into different dimensions, meaning that the projected GSV should be better as the feature vector for microphone recognition compared to the raw GSV. Two classifiers that have been used in the literature, namely linear support vector machine (SVM) and sparse representation-based classifier (SRC), are employed to compare the performance of the raw GSV and the projected GSV. The experimental results demonstrate that the projected GSV can outperform the raw GSV no matter using linear SVM or SRC as the classifier, which shows the effectiveness of the projection method.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Advancements in digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) technologies are paving the way for low-cost and automated platforms for implementing bio-protocols. However, the deployment of DMFBs outside of controlled settings will make them vulnerable to intellectual property (IP) theft. Bio-protocol development requires large investments for cross-domain innovations in biochemical analysis, microfluidics, and cyberphysical systems. We propose a watermarking technique for bio-protocol IP protection&#x2014;a first in microfluidics&#x2014;that hierarchically embeds a secret signature across these domains. Such a signature can be exclusively attributed to the owner (like a hash). The proposed solution takes into account the inherent variability in domain-specific parameters such as mixing ratio, sensor calibration, and incubation time. We describe watermarking techniques of varying complexities for different bio-protocol steps. These include watermarking for bio-protocol synthesis parameters and the cyberphysical systems control path parameters. A watermarking scheme based on integer linear programming is proposed for the sample-preparation step of a bio-protocol. The practicality of our solution is demonstrated through case studies involving an immunoassay and several mixing ratios required in the sample-preparation process of bio-protocols. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated through various security metrics: proof of ownership score, the probability of successful tampering of the watermark, and the probability of coincidence. We also analyze the integrity of the watermark against various possible attacks: brute force search, the insertion of a new watermark, and the watermarking of more parameters.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In public cloud storage services, data are outsourced to semi-trusted cloud servers which are outside of data owners&#x2019; trusted domain. To prevent untrustworthy service providers from accessing data owners&#x2019; sensitive data, outsourced data are often encrypted. In this scenario, conducting access control over these data becomes a challenging issue. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) has been proved to be a powerful cryptographic tool to express access policies over attributes, which can provide a fine-grained, flexible, and secure access control over outsourced data. However, the existing ABE-based access control schemes do not support users to gain access permission by collaboration. In this paper, we explore a special attribute-based access control scenario where multiple users having different attribute sets can collaborate to gain access permission if the data owner allows their collaboration in the access policy. Meanwhile, the collaboration that is not designated in the access policy should be regarded as a collusion and the access request will be denied. We propose an attribute-based controlled collaborative access control scheme through designating translation nodes in the access structure. Security analysis shows that our proposed scheme can guarantee data confidentiality and has many other critical security properties. Extensive performance analysis shows that our proposed scheme is efficient in terms of storage and computation overhead.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a variable structure speed controller (VSSC) that guarantees the robust transient performance against the external disturbances and parameter uncertainties of an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive. Unlike the conventional VSSC applied to the IPMSMs, the proposed nonlinear compensating control term not only assures the robustness against the system uncertainties, but also implements the maximum torque per ampere technique. Furthermore, the convergence and stability of the proposed VSSC are fully proven through the Lyapunov theory by introducing reasonable bounded uncertainties which determine a feasible range for the system dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is investigated through the simulation using MATLAB/Simulink and experiment using a prototype IPMSM drive system with a TI TMS320F28335 DSP. Finally, the proposed VSSC can ensure faster and more robust transient response than the conventional proportional-integral speed controller under the dynamic load conditions including the uncertainties.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, an intelligent energy management framework with demand response capability was proposed for industrial facilities. The framework consists of multiple components, including industrial processes modeled by the state task network method, thermostatically controlled loads, like the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system with chilled water storage, renewable generation, like photovoltaic arrays and electric vehicles. These components are first modeled and their operation is then optimized in time-of-use pricing schemes. Factors that affect several components at the same time, e.g., the number of workers, are considered. The optimization is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem. A general tire manufacturing facility was investigated as the case study. Simulation results show that the proposed intelligent industrial energy management with demand response is able to effectively utilize the flexibility contained in all parts of the facility and reduce the electricity costs, as well as the peak demand of the facility, while satisfying all the operating constraints.
