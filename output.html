</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Active authentication (AA) refers to the problem of continuously verifying the identity of a mobile device user for the purpose of securing the device. We address the problem of quickly detecting intrusions with lower false detection rates in mobile AA systems with higher resource efficiency. Bayesian and MiniMax versions of the quickest change detection (QCD) algorithms are introduced to quickly detect intrusions in mobile AA systems. These algorithms are extended with an update rule to facilitate low-frequency sensing which leads to low utilization of resources. Effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated using three publicly available unconstrained face and touch gesture-based AA datasets. It is shown that the proposed QCD-based intrusion detection methods can perform better than many state-of-the-art AA methods in terms of latency and low false detection rates. Furthermore, it is shown that employing the proposed resource-efficient extension further improves the performance of the QCD-based setup.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Sketches obtained from eyewitness descriptions of criminals have proven to be useful in apprehending criminals, particularly when there is a lack of evidence. Automated methods to identify subjects depicted in sketches have been proposed in the literature, but their performance is still unsatisfactory when using software-generated sketches and when tested using extensive galleries with a large amount of subjects. Despite the success of deep learning in several applications including face recognition, little work has been done in applying it for face photograph-sketch recognition. This is mainly a consequence of the need to ensure robust training of deep networks by using a large number of images, yet limited quantities are publicly available. Moreover, most algorithms have not been designed to operate on software-generated face composite sketches which are used by numerous law enforcement agencies worldwide. This paper aims to tackle these issues with the following contributions: 1) a very deep convolutional neural network is utilised to determine the identity of a subject in a composite sketch by comparing it to face photographs and is trained by applying transfer learning to a state-of-the-art model pretrained for face photograph recognition; 2) a 3-D morphable model is used to synthesise both photographs and sketches to augment the available training data, an approach that is shown to significantly aid performance; and 3) the UoM-SGFS database is extended to contain twice the number of subjects, now having 1200 sketches of 600 subjects. An extensive evaluation of popular and state-of-the-art algorithms is also performed due to the lack of such information in the literature, where it is demonstrated that the proposed approach comprehensively outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all publicly available composite sketch datasets.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A collaborative security detection method is investigated for the Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Consensus protocol is utilized to implement the information sharing and fusion in a collaborative manner. A game theoretical analysis framework is developed for the collaborative security detection by considering the confrontation between the defender and the attacker. The objective is to achieve the maximum security protection for the entire IoT systems. The existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium of game model with complete consensus are analyzed. Then an iteration learning based calculation method is presented to determine the Nash equilibrium. Quantitative analysis is provided for the relationship between the Nash equilibriums of the game models in the cases of complete and incomplete consensus with infinite and finite number of iterations. Simulation results by considering DDoS attack are also provided to verify our theoretical results.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fully homomorphic encryption supports meaningful computations on encrypted data, and hence, is widely used in cloud computing and big data environments. Recently, Li et al. constructed an efficient symmetric fully homomorphic encryption scheme and utilized it to design a privacy-preserving-outsourced association rule mining scheme. Their proposal allows multiple data owners to jointly mine some association rules without sacrificing the data privacy. The security of the homomorphic encryption scheme against the known-plaintext attacks was established by examining the hardness of solving nonlinear systems. However, in this paper, we illustrate that the security of Li et al.&#x2019;s homomorphic encryption is overvalued. First, we show that we can recover the first part of the secret key from several known plaintext/ciphertext pairs with the continued fraction algorithm. Second, we find that we can retrieve the second part of the secret key through the Euclidean algorithm for the greatest common divisor problem. Experiments on the suggested parameters demonstrate that in case of more than two homomorphic multiplications, all the secret keys of the randomly instantiated Li et al.&#x2019;s encryption schemes can be very efficiently recovered, and the success probability is at least 98&#x0025; for one homomorphic multiplication.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Craniofacial superimposition (CFS) is a forensic identification technique, which studies the anatomical and morphological correspondence between a skull and a face. It involves the process of overlaying a variable number of facial images with the skull. This technique has great potential, since nowadays a wide majority of people have photographs, where their faces are clearly visible. In addition, the skull is a bone that hardly degrades under the effect of fire, humidity, temperature changes, and so on. Three consecutive stages for the CFS process have been distinguished: the acquisition and processing of the materials, the skull-face overlay, and the decision making. This final stage consists of determining the degree of support for a match based on the previous overlays. The final decision is guided by different criteria depending on the anatomical relations between the skull and the face. In previous approaches, we proposed a framework for automating this stage at different levels, taking into consideration all the information and uncertainty sources involved. In this paper, we model new anatomical skull-face regions and tackle the last level of the hierarchical decision support system. For the first time, we present a complete system, which provides a final degree of craniofacial correspondence. Furthermore, we validate our system as an automatic identification tool analyzing its capabilities in closed (known information or a potential list of those involved) and open lists (little or no idea at first who may be involved) and comparing its performance with the manual results achieved by experts, obtaining a remarkable performance. The proposed system has been demonstrated to be valid for sort-listing a given data set of initial candidates (in 62.5&#x0025; of the cases, the positive one is ranked in the first position) and to serve as an exclusion method (97.4&#x0025; and 96&#x0025; of true negatives in training and test, res-
ectively).

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Linear compressors have become more common in refrigeration applications due to their high efficiency. However, in order to achieve efficient and reliable operation of the machine, the system controller must be capable of dealing with two main issues. First, the nonlinear force of gas compression acting against the mass spring piston system causes the frequency at which system efficiency is maximized, i.e., the resonant frequency, to vary with the load. Second, the unconstrained piston stroke allows for the possibility of collision with the head, which may reduce reliability. Accounting for these issues requires knowledge of the piston dynamics; however, for reliability and cost effectiveness it is preferred to operate the system without the use of internal sensors. In this work a novel system level controller is designed to simultaneously achieve resonance-tracking and stroke control objectives utilizing a pair of nonlinear observers to obtain the necessary information sensorlessly. This design is validated under experimental testing, which demonstrates both the accuracy of the observed signals and the stability and convergence of the controller.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to the global environmental issues and energy crisis, the injection of renewable energy sources (RESs) into the power system is continuously increasing. As the interface between RESs and power grid, grid-tied inverters using MOSFET switches, without traditional line frequency transformers, show some potential advantages, in terms of low cost, high efficiency, and lightweight and small size. Among several proposed configurations, the Aalborg inverter was proposed as a new family of high efficiency MOSFET-switch-based hybrid source inverters. For a conventional &#x201c;half bridge&#x201d; type Aalborg inverter, due to the imbalance of two independent dc sources, the input dc energies may not be fully utilized, which may reduce the efficiency of whole system. In order to extract the maximum energy from two independent dc sources, a coupled-inductor-based &#x201c;half bridge&#x201d; type Aalborg inverter is proposed in this paper. The principle of operation is presented and demonstrated through equivalent circuits. The effectiveness of a new energy balancing technique has been validated through simulations and experiments on a 110 V/ 500 W prototype.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Conventional permanent magnet (PM) machine open-phase fault detection relies on the estimation of current harmonics using available phase current sensors. Because the magnitudes of current harmonic are proportional to the machine load condition, it is still a challenge to detect a phase fault at light load when fault-induced current harmonics are too small to estimate. This paper investigates the phase fault detection specifically for the conditions under low fault harmonic magnitudes. Both fault-induced harmonics in dq currents and neutral point (NP) voltage are analyzed to find a suited signal for the fault detection. By adding a voltage sensor to measure the NP voltage in a PM machine, a better fault detection performance is achieved because the fault harmonic in NP voltage results in the reduced effect on torque loads and sensor measurement errors. A 50-W PM machine is tested to verify the phase fault detection performance under low fault harmonic magnitudes. This paper includes the experimental evaluation on the detection limitation in terms of load capability using current and voltage fault signals.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a robust coupled multiple sliding-mode control (CMSMC) method for tracking control of underactuated hovercraft systems with nonholonomic constraints and external disturbances. First, a friction model for the hovercraft, one of the main disturbance factors, is proposed by considering viscosity, and its validity is demonstrated through experiments. Second, a disturbance model in the actual hovercraft system is estimated using a least-square-estimation-based disturbance observer. Third, pseudo forces and pseudo heading direction angle for tracking control and disturbance compensation are proposed considering the characteristics of underactuated hovercraft systems. Fourth, coupled multiple sliding surfaces (CMSSs) are newly introduced in terms of the tracking errors between the pseudo control variables and actual ones, and then, a CMSMC-based controller is proposed so that the CMSSs converge to zero within finite time in the case of zero disturbance estimation errors. In this way, three posture variables of the hovercraft converge to reference ones using only two control inputs. Finally, stability analysis and verification by simulations and experiments show that both the pseudo control tracking errors and posture tracking errors are ultimately bounded and asymptotically converge to zero when disturbance estimation errors become zero.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>As for ripple-current mode control, it cannot achieve average current tracking, resulting in poor current accuracy and even current waveform distortion. Meanwhile, fast-scale instability may occur in some operating conditions. To solve these problems effectively, a current-ripple compensation (CRC) control technique is proposed in this paper. The error between the average of the controlled current and the reference current is compensated by certain compensation signal, achieving average current tracking while suppressing fast-scale instability. On this basis, the compensator in the outer-voltage loop is further simplified to a proportional part by introducing a rebuilt average reference current. The idea and design procedure of the proposed CRC control technique are discussed in detail. Accordingly, two available implementation schemes for the proposed CRC are presented, including slope compensated and parabolic compensated schemes. Finally, two application cases, respectively, to dc&#x2013;dc Buck converter and Boost PFC converter, are presented to verify the proposed CRC control technique.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Privacy-preserving data aggregation has been extensively studied in smart grid. However, almost all existing schemes aggregate the total electricity consumption data of the whole user set, which sometimes cannot meet the fine-grained demands from control center in smart grid. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving multisubset data aggregation scheme, named PPMA, in smart grid. PPMA can aggregate users&#x2019; electricity consumption data of different ranges, while guaranteeing the privacy of individual users. Detailed security analysis shows that PPMA can protect individual user&#x0027;s electricity consumption privacy against a strong adversary. In addition, extensive experiments results demonstrate that PPMA has less computation overhead and no more extra communication and storage costs.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Home energy management (HEM) systems enable residential consumers to participate in demand response programs (DRPs) more actively. However, HEM systems confront some practical difficulties due to the uncertainty related to renewable energies as well as the uncertainty of consumers&#x2019; behavior. Moreover, the consumers aim for the highest level of comfort and satisfaction in operating their electrical appliances. In addition, technical limits of the appliances must be considered. Furthermore, DR providers aim at keeping the participation of consumers in DRPs and minimize the &#x201c;response fatigue&#x201d; phenomenon in the long-term period. In this paper, a stochastic model of an HEM system is proposed by considering uncertainties of electric vehicles availability and small-scale renewable energy generation. The model optimizes the customer&#x0027;s cost in different DRPs, while guarantees the inhabitants&#x2019; satisfaction by introducing a response fatigue index. Different case studies indicate that the implementation of the proposed stochastic HEM system can considerably decrease both the customers&#x2019; cost and response fatigue.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Since operating conditions of power systems always change, the input and output signals of wide-area damping controller (WADC), which are selected at an operating point, may not be able to guarantee the damping effect at other operating points. This paper focuses on a new adaptive signal selection for WADC against several operating conditions, such as various load demands, control signal failure, line and generator outages, and effect of communication latency. The joint controllability and observability is used to determine the best input and output pairs of WADC at any operating points. Small-signal and transient stabilities study in the IEEE 50-machine system including renewable sources, i.e., wind and solar photovoltaic generators are conducted to evaluate the effect of the proposed method. Study result demonstrates that the WADC with the adaptive signal selection yields superior damping effect to the WADC with the fixed signal selection over wide range operations.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the widespread adoption of Internet of Things and cloud computing in different industry sectors, an increasing number of individuals or organizations are outsourcing their Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) data in the cloud server to achieve cost saving and collaboration (e.g., data sharing). However, in this environment, preserving the privacy of data remains a key challenge and inhibiting factor to an even wider adoption of IIoT in the cloud environment. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we design a new secure channel-free certificateless searchable public key encryption with multiple keywords scheme for IIoT deployment. We then demonstrate the security of the scheme in the random oracle model against two types of adversaries, where one adversary is given the power to choose a random public key instead of any user&#x0027;s public key and another adversary is allowed to learn the system master key. In the presence of these types of adversaries, we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme and demonstrate that it achieves (computational) efficiency with low communication cost.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the enormous growth and volume of online social networks and their features, along with the vast number of socially connected users, it has become difficult to explain the true semantic value of published content for the detection of user behaviors. Without understanding the contextual background, it is impractical to differentiate among various groups in terms of their relevance and mutual relations, or to identify the most significant representatives from the community at large. In this paper, we propose an integrated social media content analysis platform that leverages three levels of features, i.e., user-generated content, social graph connections, and user profile activities, to analyze and detect anomalous behaviors that deviate significantly from the norm in large-scale social networks. Several types of analyses have been conducted for a better understanding of the different user behaviors in the detection of highly adaptive malicious users. We attempted a novel approach regarding the process of data extraction and classification to contextualize large-scale networks in a proper manner. We also collected a significant number of user profiles from Twitter and YouTube, along with around 13 million channel activities. Extensive evaluations were conducted on real-world datasets of user activities for both social networks. The evaluation results show the effectiveness and utility of the proposed approach.

<p><span class="paragraphSection"><strong>To the Editor</strong> In the January 2, 2018, issue of <span style="font-style: italic;">JAMA</span>, we published a Research Letter: &#8220;Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder Among US Children and Adolescents, 2014-2016.&#8221; Using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), we found that the weighted prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was 2.41% (95% CI, 2.17%-2.65%) in 2014-2016. Sample weights are provided with the NHIS data for researchers to use during analysis to take into account unequal probabilities of selection and nonresponse. For the analysis of the 2016 data, we used the weights originally released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in June 2017. The CDC identified inaccuracies in the original sampling weights and updated them in November 2017, after acceptance of the Research Letter, but we did not become aware of this change until December 27, 2017. We reran all the analyses for our estimates using the updated weights. The conclusions were not changed, but there were some small changes in the results for the 2016 data and the pooled data from 2014-2016. For example, the overall prevalence of ASD changed from 2.41% to 2.47% (95% CI, 2.20%-2.73%), with the estimate being within the original 95% CI. The text and table of the Research Letter have been corrected online and a correction notice accompanies this letter.</span>
