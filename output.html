<p>An independent review of gross negligence manslaughter (GNM) and culpable homicide, published on June 6, describes how the conduct of the General Medical Council (GMC) relating to the case of Hadiza Bawa-Garba severely damaged its relationship with the doctors it is supposed to regulate. The review acknowledges several serious concerns about the GMC that emerged from this, and other similar, recent cases. These concerns include an over-representation of black and ethnic minority doctors referred to the GMC and a potential conflict in the responsibilities of the GMC both to ensure doctors are safe to practise and to maintain public confidence in the profession.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The goal of objective stereoscopic image quality assessment (SIQA) is to predict the human perceptual quality of stereoscopic/3D images automatically and accurately. Compared with traditional 2D image quality assessment, the quality assessment of stereoscopic images is more challenging because of complex binocular vision mechanisms and multiple quality dimensions. In this paper, inspired by the hierarchical dual-stream interactive nature of the human visual system, we propose a stereoscopic image quality assessment network (StereoQA-Net) for no-reference stereoscopic image quality assessment. The proposed StereoQA-Net is an end-to-end dual-stream interactive network containing left and right view sub-networks, where the interaction of the two sub-networks exists in multiple layers. We evaluate our method on the LIVE stereoscopic image quality databases. The experimental results show that our proposed StereoQA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on both symmetrically and asymmetrically distorted stereoscopic image pairs of various distortion types. In a more general case, the proposed StereoQA-Net can effectively predict the perceptual quality of local regions. In addition, cross-dataset experiments also demonstrate the generalization ability of our algorithm.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Skeleton-based human action recognition has been a hot topic in recent years. Most existing studies are based on the skeleton data obtained from Kinect, which is noisy and unstable, in particular, in the case of occlusions. To cope with the noisy skeleton data and variation of viewpoints, this paper presents a view-invariant method for human action recognition by recovering the corrupted skeletons based on a 3D bio-constrained skeleton model and visualizing those body-level motion features obtained during the recovery process with images. The bio-constrained skeleton model is defined with two types of constraints: 1) constant bone lengths and 2) motion limits of joints. Based on the bio-constrained model, an effective method is proposed for skeleton recovery. Two types of new motion features, the Euclidean distance matrix between joints (JEDM), which contains the global structure information of the body, and the local dynamic variation of the joint Euler angles (JEAs) are used in describing human action. These two types of features are encoded into different motion images, which are fed into a two-stream convolutional neural network for learning different action patterns. The experiments on three benchmark datasets achieve better accuracy than the state-of-the-art approaches, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose a unified framework to discover the number of clusters and group the data points into different clusters using subspace clustering simultaneously. Real data distributed in a high-dimensional space can be disentangled into a union of low-dimensional subspaces, which can benefit various applications. To explore such intrinsic structure, state-of-the-art subspace clustering approaches often optimize a self-representation problem among all samples, to construct a pairwise affinity graph for spectral clustering. However, a graph with pairwise similarities lacks robustness for segmentation, especially for samples which lie on the intersection of two subspaces. To address this problem, we design a hyper-correlation-based data structure termed as the triplet relationship, which reveals high relevance and local compactness among three samples. The triplet relationship can be derived from the self-representation matrix, and be utilized to iteratively assign the data points to clusters. Based on the triplet relationship, we propose a unified optimizing scheme to automatically calculate clustering assignments. Specifically, we optimize a model selection reward and a fusion reward by simultaneously maximizing the similarity of triplets from different clusters while minimizing the correlation of triplets from the same cluster. The proposed algorithm also automatically reveals the number of clusters and fuses groups to avoid over-segmentation. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Given a set of image denoisers, each having a different denoising capability, is there a provably optimal way of combining these denoisers to produce an overall better result? An answer to this question is fundamental to designing an ensemble of weak estimators for complex scenes. In this paper, we present an optimal combination scheme by leveraging the deep neural networks and the convex optimization. The proposed framework, called the Consensus Neural Network (CsNet), introduces three new concepts in image denoising: 1) a provably optimal procedure to combine the denoised outputs via convex optimization; 2) a deep neural network to estimate the mean squared error (MSE) of denoised images without needing the ground truths; and 3) an image boosting procedure using a deep neural network to improve the contrast and to recover the lost details of the combined images. Experimental results show that CsNet can consistently improve the denoising performance for both deterministic and neural network denoisers.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Sparse coding-based anomaly detection has shown promising performance, of which the keys are feature learning, sparse representation, and dictionary learning. In this paper, we propose a new neural network for anomaly detection (termed AnomalyNet) by deeply achieving feature learning, sparse representation, and dictionary learning in three joint neural processing blocks. Specifically, to learn better features, we design a motion fusion block accompanied by a feature transfer block to enjoy the advantages of eliminating noisy background, capturing motion, and alleviating data deficiency. Furthermore, to address some disadvantages (e.g., nonadaptive updating) of the existing sparse coding optimizers and embrace the merits of neural network (e.g., parallel computing), we design a novel recurrent neural network to learn sparse representation and dictionary by proposing an adaptive iterative hard-thresholding algorithm (adaptive ISTA) and reformulating the adaptive ISTA as a new long short-term memory (LSTM). To the best of our knowledge, this could be one of the first works to bridge the  $ell _{1}$ -solver and LSTM and may provide novel insight into understanding LSTM and model-based optimization (or named differentiable programming), as well as sparse coding-based anomaly detection. Extensive experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of our method in the abnormal events detection task.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A deterministic privacy metric using non-stochastic information theory is developed. Particularly, maximin information is used to construct a measure of information leakage, which is inversely proportional to the measure of privacy. Anyone can submit a query to a trusted agent with access to a non-stochastic uncertain private dataset. Optimal deterministic privacy-preserving policies for responding to the submitted query are computed by maximizing the measure of privacy subject to a constraint on the worst-case quality of the response (i.e., the worst-case difference between the response by the agent and the output of the query computed on the private dataset). The optimal privacy-preserving policy is proved to be a piecewise constant function in the form of a quantization operator applied on the output of the submitted query. The measure of privacy is also used to analyze  $k$ -anonymity (a popular deterministic mechanism for privacy-preserving release of datasets using suppression and generalization techniques), proving that it is in fact not privacy preserving.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Gait is a useful biometric feature for human identification in video surveillance applications since it can be obtained without subject cooperation. In recent years, model-based gait recognition using a 3D skeleton has been widely studied through view-invariant modeling and kinematic gait analysis. However, existing methods integrate all frame-level feature vectors using the same criterion, even though skeleton information is highly sensitive to changes in covariate conditions such as clothing, carrying, and occlusion. The scheme inevitably reduces the frame-level discriminative power and eventually degrades performance. Instead, we propose a robust frame-level matching method for gait recognition that minimizes the influence of noisy patterns as well as secures the frame-level discriminative power. To this end, we measure the skeleton quality in terms of body symmetry for each frame. Based on the quality, we construct a quality-adjusted cost matrix between input frames and registered frames to prevent matching with noisy patterns. Our two-stage linear matching is then applied to the cost matrix to compute a frame-level discriminative score including similarity and margin. In the end, the identity of a probe is determined by a weighted majority voting scheme via frame-level scores. It enhances the robustness against inaccurate skeleton estimation results by assigning different weights for each frame based on the score. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets (UPCVgait, UPCVgaitK2, and SDUgait) and a new gait dataset which we create with consideration of unpredictable behaviors while walking. In addition, we demonstrate that our method is robust to skeleton estimation error, partial occlusion, and data loss. The CILgait dataset and MATLAB code are available at https://sites.google.com/site/seokeonchoi/gait-recognition.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a frequency diverse array-based directional modulation with artificial noise synthesis scheme is proposed to enhance the physical layer security of wireless communications. We aim to optimize the secrecy performance by jointly optimizing the frequency offsets, the beamforming vector, and the artificial-noise projection matrix (ANPM). Specifically, we address the physical layer security problems for known locations of proximal eavesdropper (Eve) and legitimate user (LU). The beamforming vector and frequency offsets are designed to preserve the signal power at LU. The ANPM is calculated to minimize the effect of AN on LU. Furthermore, we extend our approach to the case of multi-LUs with unknown Eve locations. Being different from the case of a single LU, the frequency offsets across array antennas are optimized to equally allocate transmitted power to each LU. The numerical results show that the proposed method can provide a higher secrecy performance than conventional DM methods. In the case of multi-LUs with unknown Eve locations, the proposed method can provide a high secrecy capacity while achieving almost equal achievable capacity to each LU.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper considers physical layer security enhancement mechanisms that utilize simultaneous beamforming and jamming in visible light communication systems with a randomly located eavesdropper under the assumption that there are multiple light-emitting diode (LED) transmitters and one intended user. When an eavesdropper with an augmented front-end receiver is present, the jamming is very useful for preventing the eavesdropper from wiretapping the information since it is not possible to extract only the information component from the received signal if the jamming signal is random. Thus, in this paper, an optimization problem is formulated with a focus on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio for the legitimate link, and it is solved by a heuristic method called the concave&#x2013;convex procedure. Then, a ternary scheme is proposed, which is less complicated than the full (joint) scheme, and it is optimized by adopting a formulation based on an assignment problem, the solution of which is effectively obtained by the so-called tabu search procedure. In addition, the problem of maximizing the average secrecy rate is investigated by utilizing a continuous LED model, which significantly relaxes the complication that rises from calculating the expectation with respect to the location of the eavesdropper. Our analysis and simulation results show that the proposed simultaneous beamforming and jamming strategies (both joint and ternary) are good proxies for maximizing the average secrecy rate by utilizing the statistical information on the eavesdropper&#x2019;s random location.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Multi-turn video question answering is a challenging task in visual information retrieval, which generates the accurate answer from the referenced video contents according to the visual conversation context and given question. However, the existing visual question answering methods mainly tackle the problem of single-turn video question answering, which may be ineffectively applied for multi-turn video question answering directly, due to the insufficiency of modeling the sequential conversation context. In this paper, we study the problem of multi-turn video question answering from the viewpoint of multi-stream hierarchical attention context reinforced network learning. We first propose the hierarchical attention context network for context-aware question understanding by modeling the hierarchically sequential conversation context structure. We then develop the multi-stream spatio-temporal attention network for learning the joint representation of the dynamic video contents and context-aware question embedding. We next devise a multi-step reasoning process to enhance the multi-stream hierarchical attention context network learning method. We finally predict the multiple-choice answer from the candidate answer set and further develop the reinforced decoder network to generate the open-ended natural language answer for multi-turn video question answering. We construct two large-scale multi-turn video question answering datasets. The extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Automated production systems are critical enablers for Industry 4.0 because these design-to-order, custom-built mechatronic systems are not only capable of delivering automation capabilities to satisfy the stakeholder requirements in the manufacturing/production domain, but doing so for a long period of time (e.g., several decades) during which numerous changing needs shall also be accounted for. Although traceability has long been recognized as key to sustain changes, little is known about how the traceability information is managed in place, i.e., in the native environments where the engineering artifacts reside. We contribute in this paper a survey of traceability support within state-of-the-practice tools: seven for programming logic controllers and six for building models in systems modeling language. We draw the similarities and differences from our survey results, and further present a design by leveraging the in-place traceability to better support the development and evolution of automated production systems.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a variable structure speed controller (VSSC) that guarantees the robust transient performance against the external disturbances and parameter uncertainties of an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive. Unlike the conventional VSSC applied to the IPMSMs, the proposed nonlinear compensating control term not only assures the robustness against the system uncertainties, but also implements the maximum torque per ampere technique. Furthermore, the convergence and stability of the proposed VSSC are fully proven through the Lyapunov theory by introducing reasonable bounded uncertainties which determine a feasible range for the system dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is investigated through the simulation using MATLAB/Simulink and experiment using a prototype IPMSM drive system with a TI TMS320F28335 DSP. Finally, the proposed VSSC can ensure faster and more robust transient response than the conventional proportional-integral speed controller under the dynamic load conditions including the uncertainties.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper introduces a novel optimum design of the proportional&#x2013;integral (PI) controller in the power converter circuits using the water cycle algorithm (WCA) to augment the transient stability of a grid-connected wave energy conversion (WEC) system. The proposed system relies on the Archimedes wave swing device, which is coupled with a linear permanent magnet synchronous generator (LPMSG). The WEC system is interfaced with the power grid via a generator-side converter (GSC) and a grid-side inverter (GSI). The GSC is used to control both of the d-axis and q-axis current of the LPMSG to minimize its power losses and extract its maximum real power, respectively. The GSI is implemented to control the terminal voltage at the point of common coupling and the dc-link voltage through a complete vector control scheme. The proposed optimal WCA-based PI control strategy is applied to both converters. The optimization process depends on the simulation-based optimization approach. In the proposed approach, the criterion of integral squared error is chosen as a multiobjective function. To validate the proposed WEC system model, the simulation results are compared with the practical results, and their error reaches less than 1&#x0025;. The effectiveness of the proposed WCA-based PI control strategy is tested and compared with that obtained using the genetic-algorithm-based PI control scheme under symmetrical and unsymmetrical grid fault conditions taking into account a successful and unsuccessful reclosure of circuit breakers. The validity of the proposed control strategy is extensively checked based on simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In recent years, great success has been achieved in visual object detection, which is one of the fundamental tasks in the field of industrial intelligence. Most of existing methods have been proposed to deal with single well-captured still images, while in practical robotic applications, due to nuisances, such as tiny scale, partial view, or occlusion, one still image may not contain enough information for object detection. However, an intelligent robot has the capability to adjust its viewpoint to get better images for detection. Therefore, active object detection becomes a very important perception strategy for intelligent robots. In this paper, by formulating active object detection as a sequential action decision process, a deep reinforcement learning framework is established to resolve it. Furthermore, a novel deep Q-learning network (DQN) with a dueling architecture is proposed, the network has two separate output channels, one predicts action type and the other predicts action range. By combining the two output channels, the action space is explored more efficiently. Several methods are extensively validated and the results show that the proposed one obtains the best results and predicts action in real time.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Cascaded H-bridge (CHB) multilevel converters are promising candidates for large-scale grid-connected photovoltaic systems (megawatt to gigawatt). However, the conventional CHB multilevel converter cannot ensure the inter-module and inter-phase power balance, resulting in imbalanced grid currents. Therefore, in this paper, a new topology consisting of CHB multilevel converters and interleaved-boost full-bridge LLC (IB-FBLLC)-based three-port dc&#x2013;dc isolation converters is proposed. In this proposed topology, a common dc bus made up of the low-voltage-side ports of IB-FBLLC-based three-port dc&#x2013;dc converters can completely solve the inherent power imbalance issues. Moreover, the design parameters of dc&#x2013;dc converters considering the minimization of the input current ripple and optimization of switching frequency range are discussed in detail. Simulation results of the three-phase system and experimental results of the single-phase system clearly verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed topology and control strategies.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Converter-driven direct current (dc) motors exhibit various advantages in industry, but impose several challenges to higher precision speed regulation in the presence of parametric uncertainties and exogenous, time-varying load torque disturbances. In this paper, the robust predictive speed regulation problem of a generic dc&#x2013;dc buck converter-driven permanent magnet dc motors is addressed by using an output feedback discrete-time model predictive control algorithm. A new discrete-time reduced-order generalized proportional-integral observer (GPIO) is proposed to reconstruct the virtual system states as well as the lumped disturbances. The estimates of GPIO are then collected for output speed prediction. An optimized duty ratio law of the converter is obtained by solving a constrained receding horizon optimization problem, where the operational constraint on control input is explicitly taken into account. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed new algorithm is demonstrated by various experimental testing results.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the automated demand response (DR) problem in smart grids equipped with information and communication technology networks, where power generating and consuming units can exchange information as a multiagent system (MAS), and a real-time pricing (RTP) scheme is proposed. When the communication graph among agents is connected, a novel parallel and distributed consensus-based algorithm is proposed to derive an RTP scheme to facilitate DR, and when communication uncertainties exist, a robust consensus algorithm is proposed to cease the effect of uncertainties. Next, this paper proposes a novel control mechanism to tackle the problem of disconnected communication among agents, e.g., under cyber-attacks, by employing the so-called mixed communication-broadcast control architecture where the underlying ideas are twofold. First, each area in the grid associated with a connected subgraph is controlled by a MAS to guarantee the power balance and to reach consensus on the local electric price for that area. Second, a supervisory unit observes those local electric prices to calculate the global electric price for the whole grid and then broadcasts to all units so that they can properly adjust their output powers. Simulations are carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system to validate the proposed control mechanisms.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Real-time winding insulation condition monitoring is becoming an important research topic in response to increase in high availability and reliability demands in modern drives. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to monitor ground-wall insulation of low-voltage inverter-fed machines based on a multifrequency measurement of equivalent insulation ground-wall capacitance and dissipation factor. The monitoring is applied to four machine stator samples subjected to accelerated aging until failure. Insulation degradation is continuously tracked via the capacitance and dissipation parameters. A link between ground-wall insulation capacitance and final lifetime is established. The relationship between capacitance progression and its value at the final machine failure is used to develop a method for the prognosis of the final failure time.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper describes an augmented reality (AR)-aided smart sensing technique for in-line condition monitoring of insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) wafers. A series of signal processing algorithms are applied for enabling sensor intelligence. Based on electromagnetic infrared&#x2013;visible fusion (IVF), a supplementary palpable three-dimensional thermography layer is integrated with an IGBT wafer in real world environment. Before the IVF, independent component analysis is implemented to identify defects in the wafer. The proposed AR-aided smart sensing technique enhances user&#x0027;s perception and interaction between the industrial systems and the surrounding world. In contrast to conventional sensor techniques, it provides nondestructive testing and evaluation based high-throughput in-line condition monitoring method. The advantages of noncontact and time efficient of this smart sensing technique potentially bring huge benefit to yield management and production efficiency. AR-aided smart sensing can improve the productivity, quality, and reliability of power electronic materials and devices, as well as in other industrial applications.
