<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Researchers at Toyohashi University of Technology, in cooperation with researchers at Teijin Pharma Ltd. and Teikyo University, have highlighted the possibility that chirality of vitamin-D derivatives can affect the protonation states of histidine residues in the vitamin-D receptor protein via ab initio molecular simulations and biomedical analyses. This finding emphasizes that protonation states should be considered more precisely in molecular simulations, when investigating specific interactions between candidate drugs and target proteins related to disease pathogenesis.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>There are several conversations in life that are inherently difficult. Talking about the end of your life and confronting your mortality when faced with a terminal diagnosis is likely to be at the top of the list. On Oct 19, the UK's Royal College of Physicians published the report: Talking about dying: How to begin honest conversations about what lies ahead. Based on extensive consultations with doctors, patients, and health-care professionals, the report highlights that physicians need to initiate honest conversations with their patients about their future care and treatment much earlier than after diagnosis of a progressive or terminal condition, including frailty.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In 2017, GlaxoSmithKline announced its intention to withdraw the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist albiglutide for commercial reasons. This announcement came before the emergence of definitive evidence regarding the cardiovascular safety and efficacy of albiglutide. In The Lancet, Adrian Hernandez and colleagues1 report results from the Harmony Outcomes trial, which showed, in 9463 participants, that albiglutide has beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes when given to people with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) represents a major burden on public health worldwide. The number of affected patients has increased in both low-income and middle-income countries (by 28&#183;7% for 2000&#8211;10) and high-income countries (by 13&#183;1%).1 The strong association with ageing, tobacco smoking, and diabetes means that the prevalence of PAD will continue to increase in the coming years.1 Although undertreatment of patients with PAD is common in many countries, endovascular intervention has become the dominant modality for treatment of obstructive disease patterns, and various different devices have been investigated in clinical trials.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Despite growing recognition of the imperative to address gender disparities and inequity in health, researchers, funders, and editors do not treat the gendered aspects of health research and practice as a priority. It is unacceptable that members of the scientific community, who are putatively committed to rigour and objectivity, undervalue the importance of the gender bias in academic research and neglect to act. Is this because gender has become equated with feminism, which some argue has no place in science?1 Is it a reflection of the long-standing marginalisation of women in medical research where they have been the subjects of attention mainly in matters relating to reproduction? Or it is that, historically, science has been built around a hierarchical and androcentric logic, whereby the white male body is the gold standard against which all else is measured?

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Existing charging techniques for lithium-ion batteries use a largely open-loop approach, where the charge profile is predecided based on a priori knowledge of cell parameters. There is a need for closed-loop charging techniques that use instantaneous cell voltage and/or temperature to modulate the charging current magnitude. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a constant-temperature constant-voltage (CT-CV) charging technique, considering cell temperature as a key degradation metric. The proposed CT-CV charging scheme employs a simple and easy-to-implement proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller aided by a feed-forward term. The charging current is dynamically adjusted in response to the battery temperature, which indirectly reflects its aging and thermal environment. As per experimental results, the proposed method achieves 20% faster charging with the same total temperature rise as constant-current constant-voltage (CC-CV) technique. Alternatively, it causes 20% lower cell temperature rise for given total charge time. It can easily accommodate applications that demand even faster charging by simply raising the set temperature. This paper establishes the benefits of the proposed CT-CV charging at cell level and raises the possibility of extending it to the pack level by integrating it with battery management systems.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a new design method for digital bandpass and bandstop infinite impulse response filters with nearly linear-phase response is proposed. In this method, the phase response of an all-pass filter is optimized in the frequency domain to yield less passband error Err and stopband error Er<sub>9</sub> with optimal stopband attenuation A<sub>9</sub>. To achieve high accuracy in passband and stopband regions, fractional derivative (FD) constraints are evaluated in the respective regions, and the filter coefficients are computed using the Lagrange multiplier method. The behavior of fidelity parameters measured in terms of E<sub>rr</sub>, Er<sub>9</sub>, and phase error Er<sub>ph</sub> is multimodel w.r.t. FD values. Therefore, modern heuristic technique, known as cuckoo search optimization is used for determining the optimal value of FDs and reference frequency simultaneously to minimize the fitness function, which is constructed as a sum of the squared error in passband and stopband. The designed filter yields up to 60% reduction in Err and Erph in the case of bandpass filter. Meanwhile, the response of filter is not degraded due to the finite word length effect.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The energy hub is a powerful conceptualization of how to acquire, convert, and distribute energy resources in the smart city. However, uncertainties such as intermittent renewable energy injection present challenges to energy hub optimization. This paper solves the optimal energy flow of adjacent energy hubs to minimize the energy costs by utilizing the flexibility of energy resources in a smart city with uncertain renewable generation. It innovatively models the power and gas flows between hubs using chance constraints, thus permitting the temporary overloading acceptable on real energy networks. This novelty not only ensures system security but also helps reduce or defer network investment. By restricting the probability of chance constraints over a specific level, the energy hub optimization is formulated as a multiperiod stochastic problem with the total generation cost as the objective. Cornish-Fisher expansion is utilized to incorporate the chance constraints into the optimization, which transforms the stochastic problem into a deterministic problem. The interior-point method is then applied to resolve the developed model. The proposed chance-constrained optimization is demonstrated on a three-hub system and results extensively illustrate the impact of chance constraints on power and gas flows. This work can benefit energy hub operators by maximizing renewable energy penetration at the lowest cost in a smart city.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In microgrids, distributed load sharing plays an important role in maintaining the supply-demand balance of power. Because false data injection (FDI) is one of the crucial threats faced by future microgrids, the study of the impact of FDI on distributed load sharing is both of theoretical merit and practical value. In this paper, we consider the distributed load sharing problem of the microgrids operating in autonomous mode under FDI. Each bus is assumed to be equipped with an agent. Under a well-developed distributed load sharing protocol based on multiagent systems, we first construct an FDI attack model, where the attacker is capable of injecting false data into the bus agents. Then, a utilization level is introduced for coordinating generators, and its variation is evaluated in the presence of FDI attacks with given injection strategies. The stable region of the microgrid is defined, and conditions are given to determine stability. Finally, theoretical results are validated on the Canadian urban distribution system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Estimating communication latency is a challenging task in the applications of industrial Internet of things (IIoT). Mobile convergecast, as a many-to-one communication pattern, has been recently explored in mobile sensor networks for IIoT, where sensor nodes are usually in mobile status, and report the sensed data regularly or randomly to one or more stationary sinks through the multihop routing path. As convergecast becomes increasingly relevant for industrial sensing and monitoring, a critical part of empowering information aggregation is to maintain consistent transmission. Path duration is one important component of end-to-end delay for communications along the path. In this paper, a probabilistic model for mobile convergecast has been proposed and evaluated to capture path duration times, by considering parameters including network models, sensor network scope, and mobility patterns of network elements. Through experiments, it has been verified that the proposed model can provide a feasible analysis of end-to-end delays in industrial networks implementing convergecast.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Wireless industrial networks require reliable and deterministic communication. Determinism implies that there must be a guarantee that each data packet will be delivered within a bounded delay. Moreover, it must ensure that the potential congestion or interference will not impact the predictable properties of the network. In 2016, IEEE 802.15.4 time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) emerged as an alternative medium access control to the industrial standards such as WirelessHART and ISA100.11a. However, TSCH is based on traditional collision detection and retransmission, and cannot guarantee reliable delivery within a given time. This paper proposes LeapFrog Collaboration (LFC) to provide deterministic and reliable communication over a routing protocol (RPL) based network. LFC is a novel multipath routing algorithm that takes advantage of route diversity by duplicating the data flow onto an alternate path. Simulations and analytical results demonstrate that LFC significantly outperforms the single-path retransmission-based approach of RPL $+$ TSCH and the state-of-the-art LinkPeek solution.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the joint optimal resource allocation and probabilistic caching design for device-to-device (D2D) communications in a wireless heterogeneous network with full-duplex (FD) relays. In particular, popular contents can be cached at user devices as well as at relays that are located close to users. A user can request contents from another user via D2D communications and also from a nearby relay equipped with FD radios. In the case that there is a caching miss (i.e., the requested contents are not found at the other users/relays within the coverage range), users can connect to the base station via a relay by using the FD communication technology. Subsequently, we develop mathematical models to analyze the throughput performance with edge caching where both cochannel system level interference and FD self-interference are considered. Due to the high complexity of stochastic optimization, we develop low-complexity optimization formulation by decomposing the original problem into three simple subproblems that can be efficiently solved. Finally, numerical results are presented to illustrate developed theoretical findings in the paper and significant performance gains of the throughput performance.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Mobile-edge computing (MEC) has aroused significant attention for its performance to accelerate application&#x0027;s operation and enrich user&#x0027;s experience. With the increasing development of green computing, energy harvesting (EH) is considered as an available technology to capture energy from circumambient environment to supply extra energy for mobile devices. In this paper, we propose an online dynamic tasks assignment scheduling to investigate the tradeoff between energy consumption and execution delay for an MEC system with EH capability. We formulate it into an average weighted sum of energy consumption and execution delay minimization problem of mobile device with the stability of buffer queues and battery level as constraints. Based on the Lyapunov optimization method, we obtain the optimal scheduling about the CPU-cycle frequencies of mobile device and transmit power for data transmission. Besides, the dynamic online tasks offloading strategy is developed to modify the data backlogs of queues. The performance analysis shows the stability of the battery energy level and the tradeoff between energy consumption and execution delay. Moreover, the MEC system with EH devices and task buffers implements the high energy efficient and low latency communications. The performance of the proposed online algorithm is validated with extensive trace-driven simulations.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the rapid development of Internet of things devices and network infrastructure, there have been a lot of sensors adopted in the industrial productions, resulting in a large size of data. One of the most popular examples is the manufacture inspection, which is to detect the defects of the products. In order to implement a robust inspection system with higher accuracy, we propose a deep learning based classification model in this paper, which can find the possible defective products. As there may be many assembly lines in one factory, one huge problem in this scenario is how to process such big data in real time. Therefore, we design our system with the concept of fog computing. By offloading the computation burden from the central server to the fog nodes, the system obtains the ability to deal with extremely large data. There are two obvious advantages in our system. The first one is that we adapt the convolutional neural network model to the fog computing environment, which significantly improves its computing efficiency. The other one is that we work out an inspection model, which can simultaneously indicate the defect type and its degree. The experiments well prove that the proposed method is robust and efficient.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The cancelable biometric-based template protection method proposed in this paper addresses security and privacy concerns emerging from the phenomenal usage of biometric systems. Cancelable biometric transforms the original biometric identity of a user to a pseudo-biometric identity that is used for storage and matching purposes. The use of pseudo-identity mitigates privacy risks and allows revocability in case of compromise. This paper proposes a novel template transformation technique named random distance method which not only generates discriminative and privacy preserving revocable pseudo-biometric identities, but also reduces their size by 50%. Extensive experimentation is performed to analyze recognition and protection performance on unimodal and multimodal pseudo-identities generated with various biometric modalities such as face, thermal face, palmprint, palmvein, and fingervein. It is observed that the matching performance obtained with the proposed cancelable templates in the worst-case is closer to the performance achieved in the original domain. Also, multimodal cancelable biometric templates generated with the proposed method are observed for improved performance. Furthermore, the proposed approach is successfully analyzed for non-invertibilty, unlinkability, as well as its resistance for various types of attacks like attacks via record multiplicity, dictionary, false accepts, and brute force.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>During a pollution attack, malicious nodes purposely transmit bogus data to the honest nodes to cripple the communication. Securing the communication requires identifying and isolating the malicious nodes. However, in network coding (NC) architectures, random recombinations at the nodes increase the probability that honest nodes relay polluted packets. Thus, discriminating between honest and malicious nodes to isolate the latter turns out to be challenging at best. Band codes (BCs) are a family of rateless codes whose coding window size can be adjusted to reduce the probability that honest nodes relay polluted packets. We leverage such a property to design a distributed scheme for identifying the malicious nodes in the network. Each node counts the number of times that each neighbor has been involved in cases of polluted data reception and exchanges such counts with its neighbor nodes. Then, each node computes for each neighbor a discriminative honest score estimating the probability that the neighbor relays clean packets. We model such probability as a function of the BC coding window size, showing its impact on the accuracy and effectiveness of our distributed blacklisting scheme. We experiment distributing a live video feed in a P2P NC system, verifying the accuracy of our model and showing that our scheme allows us to secure the network against pollution attacks recovering near pre-attack video quality.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The nine-phase six-terminal induction machine (IM) has been recently proposed as a promising contender to the conventional asymmetrical six-phase type in terms of torque density, stator winding simplicity, and fault-tolerant capability. The stator is composed of nine phases, which are connected in a fashion to only provide six stator terminals. Therefore, this connection combines the high performance of a nine-phase winding with the terminal behavior of a six-phase machine. This paper introduces the machine mathematical model based on the vector space decomposition (VSD) modeling approach. The required current and voltage sequence transformation matrices are derived such that the machine is mathematically regarded as an equivalent six-phase IM with only three decoupled subspaces. This way, the same VSD-based controller structures conventionally applied to six-phase-based systems can be preserved. A 1.5-hp prototype IM is used to experimentally validate the machine model under both healthy and open-phase conditions.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Specific emitter identification is the process of identifying or discriminating different emitters based on the radio frequency fingerprints extracted from the received signal. Due to inherent non-linearities of the power amplifiers of emitters, these fingerprints provide distinguish features for emitter identification. In this paper, we develop an emitter identification based on variational mode decomposition and spectral features (VMD-SF). As VMD decomposes the received signal simultaneously into various temporal and spectral modes, we choose to explore different spectral features, including spectral flatness, spectral brightness, and spectral roll-off for improving the identification accuracy contrary to existing temporal features-based methods. For demonstrating the robustness of VMD in decomposing the received signal into emitter-specific modes, we also develop a VMD-entropy and moments (EM<sup>2</sup>) method based on existing temporal features extracted from the Hilbert Huang transform of the emitter-specific temporal modes. Our proposed method has three major steps: received signal decomposition using VMD, feature extraction, and emitter identification. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods using the probability of correct classification (F<sub>cc</sub>) both in single hop and in relaying scenario by varying the number of emitters. To demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed methods, we compared our methods with the existing empirical mode decomposition-(entropy-, first-, and second-order moments) (EMD-EM<sup>2</sup>) method both in terms of F<sub>cc</sub> and computational complexity. Results depict that the proposed VMD-SF emitter identification method outperforms the proposed VMD-EM<sup>2</sup> method and the existing EMD-EM<sup>2</sup> method both in single hop and relaying scenarios for a varying number of emitters. In addition, the proposed VMD-SF method has lowest computational cost as compared with the aforementioned method-

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In video surveillance, face recognition (FR) systems are employed to detect individuals of interest appearing over a distributed network of cameras. The performance of still-to-video FR systems can decline significantly because faces captured in unconstrained operational domain (OD) over multiple video cameras have a different underlying data distribution compared to faces captured under controlled conditions in the enrollment domain with a still camera. This is particularly true when individuals are enrolled to the system using a single reference still. To improve the robustness of these systems, it is possible to augment the reference set by generating synthetic faces based on the original still. However, without the knowledge of the OD, many synthetic images must be generated to account for all possible capture conditions. FR systems may, therefore, require complex implementations and yield lower accuracy when training on many less relevant images. This paper introduces an algorithm for domain-specific face synthesis (DSFS) that exploits the representative intra-class variation information available from the OD. Prior to operation (during camera calibration), a compact set of faces from unknown persons appearing in the OD is selected through affinity propagation clustering in the captured condition space (defined by pose and illumination estimation). The domain-specific variations of these face images are then projected onto the reference still of each individual by integrating an image-based face relighting technique inside the 3-D reconstruction framework. A compact set of synthetic faces is generated that resemble individuals of interest under the capture conditions relevant to the OD. In a particular implementation based on sparse representation classification, the synthetic faces generated with the DSFS are employed to form a cross-domain dictionary that accounts for structured sparsity, where the dictionary blocks combine the original and synthetic faces o-
 each individual. Experimental results obtained with videos from the Chokepoint and COX-S2V data sets reveal that augmenting the reference gallery set of still-to-video FR systems using the proposed DSFS approach can provide a significantly higher level of accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, with only a moderate increase in its computational complexity.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Video forensics keeps developing new technologies to verify the authenticity and the integrity of digital videos. While most of the existing methods rely on the analysis of the video data stream, recently, a new line of research was introduced to investigate video life cycle based on the analysis of the video container. Anyway, existing contributions in this field are based on manual comparison of video container structure and content, which is time demanding and error-prone. In this paper, we introduce a method for unsupervised analysis of video file containers, and present two main forensic applications of such method: the first one deals with video integrity verification, based on the dissimilarity between a reference and a query file container; the second one focuses on the identification and classification of the source device brand, based on the analysis of containers structure and content. Noticeably, the latter application relies on the likelihood-ratio framework, which is more and more approved by the forensic community as the appropriate way to exhibit findings in court. We tested and proved the effectiveness of both applications on a dataset composed by 578 videos taken with modern smartphones from major brands and models. The proposed approaches are proved to be valuable also for requiring an extremely small computational cost as opposed to all available techniques based on the video stream analysis or manual inspection of file containers.
