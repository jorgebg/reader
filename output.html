<p>Much has been accomplished over the past two decades in global HIV treatment and prevention. Although in need of renewed emphasis, the worldwide scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has gone beyond what many imagined possible. Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is available in many high-income countries and in some lower-income and middle-income countries. The US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and other funders are expanding access to rapid or same-day ART initiation and piloting PrEP programmes in international settings.

<p>We thank Bjorn Stime and colleagues for their thoughtful correspondence, which raises a broader conversation about the link between colonisation, land, and health.

We aimed to provide an overview of the health-care systems of Canada, their challenges, and solutions under debate. We also endeavoured to highlight the tremendous effects of the social determinants of health, particularly (but not exclusively) for Indigenous people.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Retrieving specific persons with various types of queries, e.g., a set of attributes or a portrait photo has great application potential in large-scale intelligent surveillance systems. In this paper, we propose a richly annotated pedestrian (RAP) dataset which serves as a unified benchmark for both attribute-based and image-based person retrieval in real surveillance scenarios. Typically, previous datasets have three improvable aspects, including limited data scale and annotation types, heterogeneous data source, and controlled scenarios. Differently, RAP is a large-scale dataset which contains 84928 images with 72 types of attributes and additional tags of viewpoint, occlusion, body parts, and 2589 person identities. It is collected in the real uncontrolled scene and has complex visual variations in pedestrian samples due to the change of viewpoints, pedestrian postures, and cloth appearance. Towards a high-quality person retrieval benchmark, an amount of state-of-the-art algorithms on pedestrian attribute recognition and person re-identification (ReID), are performed for quantitative analysis with three evaluation tasks, i.e., attribute recognition, attribute-based and image-based person retrieval, where a new instance-based metric is proposed to measure the dependency of the prediction of multiple attributes. Finally, some interesting problems, e.g., the joint feature learning of attribute recognition and ReID, and the problem of cross-day person ReID, are explored to show the challenges and future directions in person retrieval.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Depth information is being widely used in many real-world applications. However, due to the limitation of depth sensing technology, the captured depth map in practice usually has much lower resolution than that of color image counterpart. In this paper, we propose to combine the internal smoothness prior and external gradient consistency constraint in graph domain for depth super-resolution. On one hand, a new graph Laplacian regularizer is proposed to preserve the inherent piecewise smooth characteristic of depth, which has desirable filtering properties. A specific weight matrix of the respect graph is defined to make full use of information of both depth and the corresponding guidance image. On the other hand, inspired by an observation that the gradient of depth is small except at edge separating regions, we introduce a graph gradient consistency constraint to enforce that the graph gradient of depth is close to the thresholded gradient of guidance. We reinterpret the gradient thresholding model as variational optimization with sparsity constraint. In this way, we remedy the problem of structure discrepancy between depth and guidance. Finally, the internal and external regularizations are casted into a unified optimization framework, which can be efficiently addressed by ADMM. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art with respect to both objective and subjective quality evaluations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Image annotation aims to annotate a given image with a variable number of class labels corresponding to diverse visual concepts. In this paper, we address two main issues in large-scale image annotation: 1) how to learn a rich feature representation suitable for predicting a diverse set of visual concepts ranging from object, scene to abstract concept and 2) how to annotate an image with the optimal number of class labels. To address the first issue, we propose a novel multi-scale deep model for extracting rich and discriminative features capable of representing a wide range of visual concepts. Specifically, a novel two-branch deep neural network architecture is proposed, which comprises a very deep main network branch and a companion feature fusion network branch designed for fusing the multi-scale features computed from the main branch. The deep model is also made multi-modal by taking noisy user-provided tags as model input to complement the image input. For tackling the second issue, we introduce a label quantity prediction auxiliary task to the main label prediction task to explicitly estimate the optimal label number for a given image. Extensive experiments are carried out on two large-scale image annotation benchmark datasets, and the results show that our method significantly outperforms the state of the art.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Random walk is a popular and efficient algorithm for image segmentation, especially for extracting regions of interest (ROIs). One difficulty with the random walk algorithm is the requirement for solving a huge sparse linear system when applied to large images. Another limitation is its sensitivity to seeds distribution, i.e., the segmentation result depends on the number of seeds as well as their placement, which puts a burden on users. In this paper, we first propose a continuous random walk model with explicit coherence regularization (CRWCR) for the extracted ROI, which helps to reduce the seeds sensitivity, so as to reduce the user interactions. Then, a very efficient algorithm to solve the CRWCR model will be developed, which helps to remove the difficulty of solving huge linear systems. Our algorithm consists of two stages: initialization by performing one-dimensional random walk sweeping based on user-provided seeds, followed by the alternating direction scheme, i.e., Peaceman&#x2013;Rachford scheme for further correction. The first stage aims to provide a good initial guess for the ROI, and it is very fast since we just solve a limited number of one-dimensional random walk problems. Then, this initial guess is evolved to the ideal solution by applying the second stage, which should also be very efficient since it fits well for GPU computing, and 10 iterations are usually sufficient for convergence. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the proposed model as well as the efficiency of the two-stage algorithm.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Multispectral imaging is of wide application for its capability in acquiring the spectral information of scenes. Due to hardware limitation, multispectral imaging device usually cannot achieve high-spatial resolution. To address the issue, this paper proposes a multispectral image super-resolution algorithm, referred as SRIF, by fusing the low-resolution multispectral image and the high-resolution (HR) RGB image. It deals with the general circumstance that image intensity is linear to scene radiance for multispectral imaging devices while is nonlinear and unknown for most RGB cameras. The SRIF algorithm first solves the inverse camera response function and a spectral sensitivity function of RGB camera, and establishes the linear relationship between multispectral and RGB images. Then the unknown HR multispectral image is efficiently reconstructed according to the linear image degradation models. Meanwhile, the edge structure of the reconstructed HR multispectral image is kept in accordance with that of the RGB image using a weighted total variation regularizer. The effectiveness of the SRIF algorithm is evaluated on both public datasets and our image set. Experimental results validate that the SRIF algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-arts in terms of both reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Garbled circuits are general tools that allow two parties to compute any function without disclosing their respective inputs. Applications of this technique vary from distributed privacy-preserving machine learning tasks to secure outsourced authentication. Unfortunately, the energy cost of garbled circuit evaluation protocols is substantial. This limits the applicability of garbled circuits in scenarios that involve battery-operated devices, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and smartphones. In this paper, we propose MEG, a Memory- and Energy-efficient Garbled circuit evaluation mechanism. MEG utilizes batch data transmission and multi-threading to reduce memory and energy consumption. We implement MEG on an Android smartphone and compare its performance and energy consumption with state-of-the-art techniques using two garbled circuits of widely different sizes (AES-128 and 256-bit edit distance). Our results show that, compared with &#x201c;plain&#x201d; garbled circuit evaluation, MEG decreases memory consumption by more than 90%. When compared with current pipelined garbled circuit evaluation techniques, MEG's energy usage was 42% lower for AES-128 and 23% lower for EDT-256. Furthermore, our multi-thread implementation of MEG decreased circuit evaluation time by up to 56.7% for AES-128, and by up to 13.5% for EDT-256, compared with state-of-the-art pipelining techniques.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>DC-link current ripple is one of the important factors for operating the current-source converter. In practice, the dc-link current ripple can be reduced by increasing the switching frequency or inductance. However, it may result in the higher switching losses, larger size, or higher cost. In order to deal with this problem, the inherent limitation of the conventional solution is discussed in this paper. The time-domain equation of the dc-link current is established for the first time. And then, a new space vector control strategy is proposed to reduce the ripple with no need of increasing the switching frequency or inductance. The space vector is divided into 12 sectors, where the dc-link current ripple can be effectively reduced by the optimal vector sequence. Finally, the proposed method is implemented on the TMS320F28335DSP + XC3400FPGA digital control hardware platform. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper introduces a new similarity measure, the covering similarity, which we formally define for evaluating the similarity between a symbolic sequence and a set of symbolic sequences. A pairwise similarity can also be directly derived from the covering similarity to compare two symbolic sequences. An efficient implementation to compute the covering similarity is proposed which uses a suffix-tree data structure, but other implementations, based on suffix array for instance, are possible and are possibly necessary for handling very large-scale problems. We have used this similarity to isolate attack sequences from normal sequences in the scope of host-based intrusion detection. We have assessed the covering similarity on two well-known benchmarks in the field. In view of the results reported on these two datasets for the state-of-the-art methods, according to the comparative study, we have carried out based on three challenging similarity measures commonly used for string processing, or in bioinformatics, we show that the covering similarity is particularly relevant to address the detection of anomalies in sequences of system calls.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to its cost efficiency, the controller area network (CAN) is still the most wide-spread in-vehicle bus, and the numerous reported attacks demonstrate the urgency in designing new security solutions for CAN. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection mechanism that takes advantage of Bloom filtering to test frame periodicity based on message identifiers and parts of the data-field which facilitates detection of potential replay or modification attacks. This proves to be an effective approach since most of the traffic from in-vehicle buses is cyclic in nature and the format of the data-field is fixed due to rigid signal allocation. Bloom filters provide an efficient time-memory tradeoff which is beneficial for the constrained resources of automotive grade controllers. We test the correctness of our approach and obtain good results on an industry-standard CANoe-based simulation for a J1939 commercial-vehicle bus and also on CAN with flexible data-rate traces obtained from a real-world high-end vehicle. The proposed filtering mechanism is straightforward to adapt for any other time-triggered in-vehicle bus, e.g., FlexRay, since it is built on time-driven characteristics.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Minimal distortion steganography is the most successful model for adaptive steganography, in which the cost function determines the security. Texture complexity is the major factor in defining cost function in images. In this paper, we proposed a method to improve the cost function of JPEG steganography by exploiting the texture in microscale. The proposed scheme is designed by using a &#x201c;microscope&#x201d; to highlight details in an image, so that distortion definition can be more refined. Linear unsharp masking acts as the microscope, because it can accentuate the texture region as well as maintain the original characteristics of images. Inter-block spreading rule is proposed to further strengthen the security. We improve the state-of-the-art schemes, J-UNIWARD and UERD, as J-UNIWARD has outstanding performance on resisting detection while UERD has significant lower computational complexity. In order to keep high efficiency of UERD, filtering in the DCT domain is introduced. Extending experiments show that in most cases the proposed methods (J-MSUNIWARD and MSUERD) can achieve a higher level of security than the original methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we consider user scheduling and power allocation techniques for downlinks where transmitted message must be kept confidential from all other unintended users and the number of users is larger than that of access point (AP) antennas. In order to maximize network secrecy rate with a limited number of antennas, the AP schedules a user who can achieve the largest secrecy rate and exploits multiple antennas for transmitting artificial noise to the unintended users. We derive the closed-form expressions of the optimal power allocation for the artificial noise and the average network secrecy rate through asymptotic analysis. The analysis results provide the insightful information on the behaviors of the user scheduling and the effect of system parameters on the network secrecy rate performance. It is shown that opportunistic scheduling with artificial noise transmission technique is more effective than the conventional precoding techniques for multiple confidential message transmissions in terms of network secrecy rate. Furthermore, we have also discussed a transmission strategy for the worst case scenarios where all unintended users are treated as colluding eavesdroppers. The simulations confirm the validity of the analysis results and provide additional information on the network performance in general cases.

In the proposed approach, the grid frequency is obtained by minimizing the error signal using a frequency-locked loop mechanism that consists of a resonant adaptive filter and a perturbation-based extremum seeking algorithm. Simulations and experimental studies are presented to demonstrate performance of the proposed controller in face of the frequency variations of an emulated grid voltage waveform. The results are compared with conventional nonadaptive methods, which indicate that performance characteristics for voltage/frequency tracking and power factor can be achieved based on the IEEE 1547 standard.

<p>Micro-short-circuit (MSC) is a latent risk in power batteries, which may give rise to thermal runaway and even catastrophic safety hazards. The motivation of this paper is to quantitatively analyze MSC in an initial stage, particularly for lithium-ion batteries. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, an equivalent MSC experiment is carried out. Based on a cell difference model, the cell state of charge (SOC) differences with the mean SOC for a battery pack are estimated by extended Kalman filter. The evaluated SOC difference can track the actual value well. Furthermore, an MSC diagnostic method is developed by employing recursive least squares filter. The method is demonstrated to examine the short-circuit resistance accurately. The results also show that the proposed method requires low computational load for the SOC difference and short-circuit resistance diagnosis.

<p>In order to develop the flux dipping process, a quantitative mathematical model that accurately describes the flux dipping process in the flip-chip bonding is proposed. The whole dynamic dipping process is captured by the high-speed transient imaging followed by image processing. Curve fitting of experimental results yields the relation between flux dipping quantity and process parameters. It suggests a quadratic function of quantity ( $Q$) with respect to dipping depth ( $d$), and a piece-wise function to dipping speed ( $v$) including an exponential section and a quadratic or linear section. While the coupled effect of d and v can be expressed as a merged function of $Q= f_{(d,v)}$, these mathematical models are proved to be effective when applied to the actual dipping process practiced on a flip-chip bonding machine, thus providing a reliable mathematical basis for optimizing dipping flux in industrial manufacturing.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A microgrid may comprise several zones with local loads and distributed generation resources. If a fault occurs in a zone, then a static switch between the faulty and fault-free zones must be activated to detect/classify the faults and enable the breaker to open the circuit immediately. This paper presents a new method for designing a detection/classification module in a static switch using the Park Transform (PT), Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) and Takagi&#x2013;Sugeno&#x2013;Kang (TSK) fuzzy rules. Both wavelet coefficients/energies of the d-axis component, within 0.96&#x2013;1.92 kHz, obtained by MRA and PT are employed to effectively detect and classify the fault types using the local fault signals near the static switch without a complicated communication system. The proposed TSK fuzzy rules, defined by the scenario data only, successfully classify the faults. The proposed method is verified by hardware-in-the-loop simulation using a real-time digital simulator and a realistic 5 kVA static switch. The proposed method is implemented in a Xilinx field-programmable gate array. Test results show that the proposed method is efficient in the real-time control environment of a microgrid.

<p>Several industries in many different domains are looking at deep learning as a way to take advantage of the insights in their data, to improve their competitiveness, to open up novel business possibilities, or to resolve the problem that thought to be impossible to tackle. The large scale of the systems where deep learning is applied and the need of preserving the privacy of the used data have imposed a shift from the traditional centralized deployment to a more collaborative one. However, this has opened up several vulnerabilities caused by compromised nodes and inputs, with traditional crypto primitives and access control models exploited to offer protection means. Providing security can be costly in terms of higher energy consumption, calling for a wise use of these protection means. This paper exploits game theory to model interactions among collaborative deep learning nodes and to decide when using actions to support security enhancements.

To estimate the social cost of demand response (DR), building aggregators need to assess occupants&#x2019; thermal discomfort (TD), which is related to their productivity outcomes. This paper proposes a price-based DR strategy for multizone office buildings to co-optimize the energy cost of HVAC units and the TD levels of occupants. To overcome simplified TD representations, a mobile interface is developed that grants occupants the ability to indicate their personal thermal preferences. These preferences are modeled using artificial neural networks, which are explicitly and directly integrated into the optimal DR scheduling. In addition, we evaluate the thermal response of a multizone office building to the operation of a variable speed heat pump (VSHP). Using the models of occupants&#x2019; TD and building thermal response, the optimization problem for the proposed DR strategy is formulated and solved with mixed-integer linear programming. The case study results verify that the proposed strategy successfully optimizes VSHP operations and occupants&#x2019; TD levels, mitigating the risk of occupant interruption to the optimal DR schedule.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Regarding the potentials of activating commercial consumers in demand response programs, this paper proposes a new framework for energy scheduling of an active distribution network based on the concept of technical virtual power plant (TVPP), considering operational constraints of distribution network. The TVPP enables presence of commercial buildings and other distributed energy resources in day-ahead (DA) electricity market, as a price maker agent. In this regard, a bilevel optimization framework is designed to optimize the bidding strategy of TVPP in the DA market with the main goal of maximizing TVPP profit. The upper-level problem maximizes the TVPP profit, while in the lower level, market is cleared from independent system operator viewpoint. Using Karush&#x2014;Kuhn&#x2013;Tucker optimality conditions and strong duality theory, the proposed bilevel problem is transformed into mixed integer linear programming problem. Implementing the model on the Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS) test system demonstrates the applicability of the proposed model.
