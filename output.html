<p>The UK Government's appointment of Jackie Doyle-Price to the newly created role of Minister for Suicide Prevention marks a welcome development in the approach to an area of some concern. While suicide rates have fallen heavily in the UK since the Office for National Statistics began keeping records in 1981, almost no progress has been made in suicide rate reduction during 2007&#8211;17, with the overall suicide rate rising from 10&#183;0 deaths per 100&#8200;000 to 10&#183;1 deaths per 100&#8200;000.

<p>The Alma-Ata vision of a health system rooted in primary health care, which is person-centred and multisectoral, is as relevant now as it ever was. Nursing and midwifery can play a more central part in making this vision a reality. The health workforce has always been central to the 1978 Declaration of Alma-Ata that recognised the important role of health workers in achieving this vision.1 More recently, the World Health Assembly adopted resolutions on the Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health in 20162 and the Working for Health 5-year action plan in 20173 that committed countries to develop a primary health care workforce responsive to population needs as part of universal health coverage.

Mortality from non-communicable diseases could be reduced through inexpensive population-based and clinical interventions, especially fiscal policies such as heavy tobacco taxation.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Bullying and aggression carry heavy societal costs. For the first time, Duke-NUS researchers have found a signalling mechanism in the brain that shapes social behaviour -- specifically a growth factor protein, called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), which affects social dominance. This novel discovery has implications for a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of aggression and bullying.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Human activity recognition is a core problem in intelligent automation systems due to its far-reaching applications including ubiquitous computing, health-care services, and smart living. Due to the nonintrusive property of smartphones, smartphone sensors are widely used for the identification of human activities. However, unlike applications in vision or data mining domain, feature embedding from deep neural networks performs much worse in terms of recognition accuracy than properly designed handcrafted features. In this paper, we posit that feature embedding from deep neural networks may convey complementary information and propose a novel knowledge distilling strategy to improve its performance. More specifically, an efficient shallow network, i.e., single-layer feedforward neural network (SLFN), with handcrafted features is utilized to assist a deep long short-term memory (LSTM) network. On the one hand, the deep LSTM network is able to learn features from raw sensory data to encode temporal dependencies. On the other hand, the deep LSTM network can also learn from SLFN to mimic how it generalizes. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of recognition accuracy against several state-of-the-art methods in the literature.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the joint optimal resource allocation and probabilistic caching design for device-to-device (D2D) communications in a wireless heterogeneous network with full-duplex (FD) relays. In particular, popular contents can be cached at user devices as well as at relays that are located close to users. A user can request contents from another user via D2D communications and also from a nearby relay equipped with FD radios. In the case that there is a caching miss (i.e., the requested contents are not found at the other users/relays within the coverage range), users can connect to the base station via a relay by using the FD communication technology. Subsequently, we develop mathematical models to analyze the throughput performance with edge caching where both cochannel system level interference and FD self-interference are considered. Due to the high complexity of stochastic optimization, we develop low-complexity optimization formulation by decomposing the original problem into three simple subproblems that can be efficiently solved. Finally, numerical results are presented to illustrate developed theoretical findings in the paper and significant performance gains of the throughput performance.

<p>Stimulated by the recent development of fog computing technology, in this paper, a fog-computing-aided process monitoring and control architecture is proposed for large-scale industrial processes, which enables reliable and efficient online performance optimization in each fog computing node without modifying predesigned control subsystems. Moreover, a closed-loop data-driven method is developed for the process monitoring system design and an adaptive configuration approach is proposed to deal with the problems caused by the changes of process parameters and operating points. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed design approaches are verified and demonstrated through the case study on the Tennessee Eastman benchmark system.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Mobile-edge computing (MEC) has aroused significant attention for its performance to accelerate application&#x0027;s operation and enrich user&#x0027;s experience. With the increasing development of green computing, energy harvesting (EH) is considered as an available technology to capture energy from circumambient environment to supply extra energy for mobile devices. In this paper, we propose an online dynamic tasks assignment scheduling to investigate the tradeoff between energy consumption and execution delay for an MEC system with EH capability. We formulate it into an average weighted sum of energy consumption and execution delay minimization problem of mobile device with the stability of buffer queues and battery level as constraints. Based on the Lyapunov optimization method, we obtain the optimal scheduling about the CPU-cycle frequencies of mobile device and transmit power for data transmission. Besides, the dynamic online tasks offloading strategy is developed to modify the data backlogs of queues. The performance analysis shows the stability of the battery energy level and the tradeoff between energy consumption and execution delay. Moreover, the MEC system with EH devices and task buffers implements the high energy efficient and low latency communications. The performance of the proposed online algorithm is validated with extensive trace-driven simulations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the rapid development of Internet of things devices and network infrastructure, there have been a lot of sensors adopted in the industrial productions, resulting in a large size of data. One of the most popular examples is the manufacture inspection, which is to detect the defects of the products. In order to implement a robust inspection system with higher accuracy, we propose a deep learning based classification model in this paper, which can find the possible defective products. As there may be many assembly lines in one factory, one huge problem in this scenario is how to process such big data in real time. Therefore, we design our system with the concept of fog computing. By offloading the computation burden from the central server to the fog nodes, the system obtains the ability to deal with extremely large data. There are two obvious advantages in our system. The first one is that we adapt the convolutional neural network model to the fog computing environment, which significantly improves its computing efficiency. The other one is that we work out an inspection model, which can simultaneously indicate the defect type and its degree. The experiments well prove that the proposed method is robust and efficient.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The cancelable biometric-based template protection method proposed in this paper addresses security and privacy concerns emerging from the phenomenal usage of biometric systems. Cancelable biometric transforms the original biometric identity of a user to a pseudo-biometric identity that is used for storage and matching purposes. The use of pseudo-identity mitigates privacy risks and allows revocability in case of compromise. This paper proposes a novel template transformation technique named random distance method which not only generates discriminative and privacy preserving revocable pseudo-biometric identities, but also reduces their size by 50%. Extensive experimentation is performed to analyze recognition and protection performance on unimodal and multimodal pseudo-identities generated with various biometric modalities such as face, thermal face, palmprint, palmvein, and fingervein. It is observed that the matching performance obtained with the proposed cancelable templates in the worst-case is closer to the performance achieved in the original domain. Also, multimodal cancelable biometric templates generated with the proposed method are observed for improved performance. Furthermore, the proposed approach is successfully analyzed for non-invertibilty, unlinkability, as well as its resistance for various types of attacks like attacks via record multiplicity, dictionary, false accepts, and brute force.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>During a pollution attack, malicious nodes purposely transmit bogus data to the honest nodes to cripple the communication. Securing the communication requires identifying and isolating the malicious nodes. However, in network coding (NC) architectures, random recombinations at the nodes increase the probability that honest nodes relay polluted packets. Thus, discriminating between honest and malicious nodes to isolate the latter turns out to be challenging at best. Band codes (BCs) are a family of rateless codes whose coding window size can be adjusted to reduce the probability that honest nodes relay polluted packets. We leverage such a property to design a distributed scheme for identifying the malicious nodes in the network. Each node counts the number of times that each neighbor has been involved in cases of polluted data reception and exchanges such counts with its neighbor nodes. Then, each node computes for each neighbor a discriminative honest score estimating the probability that the neighbor relays clean packets. We model such probability as a function of the BC coding window size, showing its impact on the accuracy and effectiveness of our distributed blacklisting scheme. We experiment distributing a live video feed in a P2P NC system, verifying the accuracy of our model and showing that our scheme allows us to secure the network against pollution attacks recovering near pre-attack video quality.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, an enhanced mixed droop control strategy is proposed for a fuel cell/supercapacitor-based auxiliary power unit (FC/SC-APU), which is usually used in large electric vehicles, to achieve the dynamic load power allocation in a decentralized way. By applying an adjustable virtual impedance droop scheme to the SC converter and a virtual resistor droop scheme to the FC converter, the SC is able to buffer the fast-changing or pulsating load power flow, leaving the FC only providing the average load power. Since this method is fully decentralized, it features high flexibility and scalability. Furthermore, the proposed strategy is very suitable for extending the system&#x0027;s service life because the recovery and operational limit of the state-of-charge of SC have been considered in the power allocation. The operational principle of the proposed control strategy and the system design are elaborated, followed by which real-time simulations are conducted to verify theoretical analyses.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a modified uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE) structure, aimed to improve the ability to approximate and eliminate signals characterized by periodic behavior. The algorithm combines delay action with low-pass filtering, introducing high loop gain magnitude values at multiple frequencies of interest while retaining implementation feasibility by imposing finite crossover frequency, similarly to repetitive control. For a given control bandwidth, the modified UDE is shown to outperform the classical one in terms of disturbance rejection at the expense of slight phase margin loss. Simulations and experiments are given to support the feasibility of the proposed control structure, applying the revealed modification to the current control of an LCL inverter, connected to a distorted ac grid.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The dc-link capacitors are important components that tend to be one of the weakest part of power converters. Thus, it is necessary to monitor the aging parameters of dc-link capacitors in valuable power electronic systems. This paper proposes a simple yet effective variable electrical network (VEN) condition monitoring method for dc-link capacitors in three-phase pulsewidth modulation (PWM) ac&#x2013;dc&#x2013;ac power converters. The capacitance (C) and equivalent series resistance of dc-link capacitors are estimated through the designed VEN unit during the discharging process. This VEN method does not need the current sensor or injecting signals into the control loop. The above property is favorable for the hardware and controller design. Besides, the designed monitoring circuit can be an external unit or a built-in unit which offers a flexible solution for electrical devices. When the designed VEN is used as an external unit, neither the hardware design nor the programs in the controller needs to change, which is practical and economic for electrical devices in use. Experiments are carried out in a 55&#x00a0;kW ac&#x2013;dc&#x2013;ac inverter with different capacitors. The experiment results prove the method to be effective and accurate.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a circuit-level model for accurately calculating vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser&#x0027;s (VCSEL) response under pulsed working condition is implemented in the advanced design system computer-aided design environment. New normalization method and thermal leakage current expression are proposed to rate equation to improve numerical convergence of the model&#x0027;s output part, which is critical for pulsed working condition. A self-consistent decoupling method is applied to include the self-heating effects in both input and output parts of the model for getting the accurate waveforms of input current and output light power under pulsed driving conditions. The model&#x0027;s input part is similar to standard SPICE model for p-n junction diode, and is convenient for extracting model parameters to match the device&#x0027;s input impedance profile. A real device&#x0027;s model parameters are extracted, and its voltage&#x2013;current&#x2013;light power (V&#x2013;I&#x2013; P) curves, small-signal transfer function, and transient response under pulsed drive condition are calculated to demonstrate the model&#x0027;s calculation capability. The proposed model is well applicable for designing a high-power electromagnetic sensor including VCSEL and other high-frequency devices.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a structured methodology is proposed to define the architecture for a communication framework with multiframe capability, which can be embedded in a residential smart meter hardware for smart grid applications. This framework is based on the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet protocol, and it is considered that the data are exchanged via wireless technologies. The architectural model was based upon the state-of-the-art in software engineering, making use of the design patterns and the principles of low coupling and high cohesion, which result in a solution that is both more reliable and maintainable. A security module is also provided and the framework performance is evaluated, in terms of packet throughput and computational effort of the security layer on the processing device, via practical experiments of some laboratory scenarios. Furthermore, errors on some frames are introduced in order to evaluate the feasibility of this framework in real field applications. Results show that this framework architecture supports acceptable transfer rates even with extra computational cost due to the use of data encryption and separated processing modules, making it a feasible proposal for the considered application context.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In video surveillance, face recognition (FR) systems are employed to detect individuals of interest appearing over a distributed network of cameras. The performance of still-to-video FR systems can decline significantly because faces captured in unconstrained operational domain (OD) over multiple video cameras have a different underlying data distribution compared to faces captured under controlled conditions in the enrollment domain with a still camera. This is particularly true when individuals are enrolled to the system using a single reference still. To improve the robustness of these systems, it is possible to augment the reference set by generating synthetic faces based on the original still. However, without the knowledge of the OD, many synthetic images must be generated to account for all possible capture conditions. FR systems may, therefore, require complex implementations and yield lower accuracy when training on many less relevant images. This paper introduces an algorithm for domain-specific face synthesis (DSFS) that exploits the representative intra-class variation information available from the OD. Prior to operation (during camera calibration), a compact set of faces from unknown persons appearing in the OD is selected through affinity propagation clustering in the captured condition space (defined by pose and illumination estimation). The domain-specific variations of these face images are then projected onto the reference still of each individual by integrating an image-based face relighting technique inside the 3-D reconstruction framework. A compact set of synthetic faces is generated that resemble individuals of interest under the capture conditions relevant to the OD. In a particular implementation based on sparse representation classification, the synthetic faces generated with the DSFS are employed to form a cross-domain dictionary that accounts for structured sparsity, where the dictionary blocks combine the original and synthetic faces o-
 each individual. Experimental results obtained with videos from the Chokepoint and COX-S2V data sets reveal that augmenting the reference gallery set of still-to-video FR systems using the proposed DSFS approach can provide a significantly higher level of accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, with only a moderate increase in its computational complexity.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we present a new approach for counterfeit protection against remarked, overproduced, and out-of-spec integrated circuits (ICs). Our approach uses identification sequences that are regularly published by the original chip manufacturer and hidden in the electromagnetic (EM) leakage of authentic chips. A portion of the chip area is dedicated to a crypto engine running in stream cipher mode that is initialized with a unique key and an initialization vector stored in one-time-programmable antifuse memory. IC identification is carried out in the field by obtaining EM measurements of deployed ICs and by proving the presence of the genuine identification sequences in the measurements. We evaluate our approach using a proof-of-concept implementation on three FPGA boards by capturing EM leakage of the FPGAs under test at their decoupling capacitors. The results show that the user can carry out IC identification on-site, using standard lab equipment in short amount of time.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Privacy preservation is addressed for decentralized optimization, where $N$ agents cooperatively minimize the sum of $N$ convex functions private to these individual agents. In most existing decentralized optimization approaches, participating agents exchange and disclose states explicitly, which may not be desirable when the states contain sensitive information of individual agents. The problem is more acute when adversaries exist which try to steal information from other participating agents. To address this issue, we propose a privacy-preserving decentralized optimization approach based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and partially homomorphic cryptography. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that cryptographic techniques are incorporated in a fully decentralized setting to enable privacy preservation in decentralized optimization in the absence of any third party or aggregator. To facilitate the incorporation of encryption in a fully decentralized manner, we introduce a new ADMM, which allows time-varying penalty matrices and rigorously prove that it has a convergence rate of $O(1/t)$ . Numerical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness and low-computational complexity of the proposed approach.
