<p>In Reply Dr Yang and colleagues highlight some of the key challenges facing the field of biomarker discovery in general and in particular with the use of PD-L1 metrics to predict immunotherapy response in NSCLC. We agree that there are numerous challenges to interpreting PD-L1 pathological data, including the antibody clone used, intensity of staining, heterogeneity of expression within the tumor, and changes in expression over time and with interval treatments. Ultimately, controlling for all of these variables, even in the context of a clinical trial (eg, requiring evaluation of PD-L1 status from multiple biopsy sites), is very challenging and further highlights the importance of exploring these data in a real-world data set where community clinical practice precludes optimization of all of these parameters. Nevertheless, as noted in the Methods section of the article, we defined positive and negative PD-L1 results using previously published standards, including a requirement of 50% staining in a central laboratory using the 22C3 or SP142 antibodies, or annotation in the medical record of a positive result. Cases that did not adhere to these guidelines were excluded.

<p>Neuroblastoma, a malignancy of the sympathetic nervous system that arises in cells derived from the neural crest, predominantly affects young children. Although survival rates have improved significantly, neuroblastoma remains challenging due, in part, to its biological and clinical heterogeneity. Subsets of children fare well with minimal therapy, with cure rates of close to 100% for children with specific disease characteristics; however, for high-risk patients the cure rates are&#8201;approximately&#8201;50%. Current risk stratification systems consider patient age and stage as well as tumor histology and genomic features, permitting delivery of therapy that is based on the likelihood of disease recurrence. Only observation is required for some patients, whereas for other patients, maximally intensive multimodality therapy is necessary.

<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) bears unprecedented security and scalability
challenges due to the magnitude of data produced and exchanged by IoT devices
and platforms. Some of those challenges are currently being addressed by
coupling IoT applications with blockchains. However, current blockchain-backed
IoT systems simply use the blockchain to store access control policies, thereby
underutilizing the power of blockchain technology. In this paper, we propose a
new framework named Sash that couples IoT platforms with blockchain that
provides a number of advantages compared to state of the art. In Sash, the
blockchain is used to store access control policies and take access control
decisions. Therefore, both changes to policies and access requests are
correctly enforced and publicly auditable. Further, we devise a ``data
marketplace'' by leveraging the ability of blockchains to handle financial
transaction and providing ``by design'' remuneration to data producers.
Finally, we exploit a special flavor of identity-based encryption to cater for
cryptography-enforced access control while minimizing the overhead to
distribute decryption keys. We prototype Sash by using the FIWARE open source
IoT platform and the Hyperledger Fabric framework as the blockchain back-end.
We also evaluate the performance of our prototype and show that it incurs
tolerable overhead in realistic deployment settings.

<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to transform many industries.
This includes harnessing real-time intelligence to improve risk-based decision
making and supporting adaptive processes from core to edge. For example, modern
police investigation processes are often extremely complex, data-driven and
knowledge-intensive. In such processes, it is not sufficient to focus on data
storage and data analysis; as the knowledge workers (e.g., police
investigators) will need to collect, understand and relate the big data
(scattered across various systems) to process analysis. In this thesis, we
analyze the state of the art in knowledge-intensive and data-driven processes.
We present a scalable and extensible IoT-enabled process data analytics
pipeline to enable analysts ingest data from IoT devices, extract knowledge
from this data and link them to process execution data. We focus on a
motivating scenario in policing, where a criminal investigator will be
augmented by smart devices to collect data and to identify devices around the
investigation location, to communicate with them to understand and analyze
evidence. We design and implement a system (namely iCOP, IoT-enabled COP) to

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>From the practical perspective, with large-scale cargoes or nonnegligible hook masses, the centers of gravity of cargoes and hooks do not coincide with each other, and shipboard cranes usually exhibit complex double-pendulum effects during ship-to-ship or ship-to-harbor transportation, which dramatically increase the complexity of dynamic characteristics and make the control issue very challenging. At present, there is no reported work on control of double-pendulum shipboard cranes yet. To tackle such problems, this paper obtains the dynamic model of double-pendulum shipboard cranes and then provides an effective nonlinear antiswing feedback controller to achieve stable cargo transportation. Specifically, new state variable signals are generated by combining the original state variables with the ship motion (induced by sea wave perturbations). Based on this, by adding some elaborately designed nonlinear terms, an antiswing feedback controller is proposed, which can achieve stable transportation with suppressed swing, and the closed-loop asymptotic stability is proven without any linearizations or approximations to the original complex nonlinear dynamics, with rigorous theoretical analysis. As far as we know, the paper provides the first solution for both controller design and stability analysis of double-pendulum shipboard cranes. Also, several groups of hardware experiments are implemented on a self-built hardware experiment platform, which verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In order to overcome the shortcomings of the measurement methods for gas cumulative flow, especially in the long-term continuous measurement, a novel memristor-based gas cumulative flow sensor is proposed in this paper. The sensor is mainly composed of a hot-wire resistor, the memristor module, a feedback compensation network and some basic circuit components. According to the thermal balance equation and the memory characteristics of memristor, the sensor can measure the gas cumulative flow by combining the memristor resistance with the cross-sectional area of the pipe. In order to verify the design of memristor-based gas accumulation flow sensor, experiments are carried out under a constant gas flow velocity, a gradually increasing flow velocity, and a randomly varying flow velocity. The active region thickness D of the selected TiO2/TiO<sub>2-n</sub> memristor is 40 nm. The hot-wire used is a tungsten wire having a radius of 10 &#x03bc;m and a length of 2 mm. The gas measured is air at a temperature of 300 K in the paper. The experimental results show that the sensor achieves the measurement of gas cumulative flow. When gas flow velocity at the center of the pipe is 5 m/s, the measuring range is approximately 0-20 m<sup>3</sup> and the sensitivity within the effective range is approximately 28.44 &#x03a9;/m<sup>3</sup>. When the gas flow velocity, the memristor pairs increase and the gain of the amplifier changes, the measuring range, and the sensitivity of the sensor will changes accordingly.

<p>This letter proposes a method to further improve the efficiency of power amplifiers (PAs). A thermoelectric generator is used to harvest the thermal energy produced by the PA and transform it into electric energy. Then, the efficiency of the PA can be improved by feeding the obtained electric energy to the drain power supply via a dc-dc converter. For verification, a 10-W 3.2-3.8-GHz class-F PA for base station applications is built; the generated temperature distribution and the process of energy conversion are evaluated. Cost-effective commercial chips are applied to harvest, transform, convert, and feedback the energies to the drain supply. The measurement results demonstrate an improvement of 1.1% drain efficiency at the peak output.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Thanks to the advantages of high power density and the capacity of bidirectional power transfer, the CLLC resonant converter is widely used in the hybrid ac-dc microgrid as a dc transformer to interlink the ac and dc bus. Since the voltages of ac and dc bus are controlled by the energy management system, the CLLC resonant converter operates under open-loop condition, which means the switching frequency and duty cycle are fixed. As a result, in the hybrid ac-dc microgrid applications, for the CLLC converter, the main concern is not the voltage regulation but the conversion efficiency. This paper focuses on the total power loss optimization and the magnetic design of the CLLC resonant converter based on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm. In order to optimize the total power loss, an AI algorithm-based two-stage optimal design method is proposed. In the first stage, the total power loss, including the driving loss, turn-off loss, conduction loss of the switches, the power loss of the resonant capacitances, and copper and core loss of the transformer are optimized by the proposed AI algorithm, GA+PSO, and the optimal parameters, including the leakage inductances (L<sub>r1</sub> and L<sub>r2</sub>), magnetizing inductance (L<sub>m</sub>), and resonant capacitances (C<sub>r1</sub> and C<sub>r2</sub>) are derived. In the second stage, the optimal leakage inductances and magnetizing inductance are realized by setting proper distance between the primary winding and the secondary winding (d<sub>w</sub>), and the thickness of the air gap (d<sub>a</sub>). As for the magnetic design, in this paper, the leakage inductances of a planar transformer are used as the resonant inductances. The equations of dw and da to achieve the optimal leakage inductances and magnetizing inductance are derived. Both the proposed optimal design method and the equations of dw and da are validated by simulations and experiments.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A significant portion (ca. 40%) of the world's total energy is utilized in buildings. Cooling of large buildings worldwide is done by centrifugal chiller systems, where the compressors, pumps, and fans are driven by ac motors. These motors are energy hungry parts of the chiller. All-variable speed chillers, taking into account load variations, reduced the energy demand significantly compared to the constant speed ones. Induction motors (IMs) are commonly used in modern chillers. However, as the efficiency of the IM decreases with the speed, the overall efficiency drops, as the chiller operates most of the time in part-load condition. In this paper, SimulationX software is used to quantitatively investigate about the energy efficiency improvement by using synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) in all-variable speed centrifugal chillers. The system was tested for three distinct building load profiles. The results are judged in comparison with the state-of-the-art IE2 IMs. The results provide quantitative evidence that SynRM can significantly increase the energy efficiency in the chiller systems and has a big potential to substitute IMs in these applications.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel sensor-less switching method based on logic gates for a five-level packed U-cell (PUC5) converter. It comprises only two level-shifted triangular carriers and logic gates. Hence, the number of triangular carriers is halved and the switching states table is eliminated, which cause remarkable reduction in complexity of the proposed modulation method. Moreover, employing the proposed sensor-less switching method leads to decrease in the PUC5 capacitor value by a factor of carrier ratio, fast self-balancing of the PUC5 capacitor voltage, and halving the output LC filter inductor and capacitor values in stand-alone mode, as well as the grid-link inductor value in grid-connected mode. In addition, the PUC5 converter start-up transient time is considerably decreased and the first switching harmonic cluster frequency is doubled, which lead to notable improvement of steady-state and dynamic performances of the PUC5 converter. The proposed sensor-less switching method has been implemented in both stand-alone and grid-connected operating modes of PUC5 converter. Provided simulation and experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed sensor-less switching method as well as its improved dynamic and steady-state performances in both stand-alone and grid-connected modes.

<p>Smart contracts are software programs featuring both traditional applications
and distributed data storage on blockchains. Ethereum is a prominent blockchain
platform with the support of smart contracts. The smart contracts act as
autonomous agents in critical decentralized applications and hold a significant
amount of cryptocurrency to perform trusted transactions and agreements.
Millions of dollars as part of the assets held by the smart contracts were
stolen or frozen through the notorious attacks just between 2016 and 2018, such
as the DAO attack, Parity Multi-Sig Wallet attack, and the integer
underflow/overflow attacks. These attacks were caused by a combination of
technical flaws in designing and implementing software codes. However, many
more vulnerabilities of less severity are to be discovered because of the
scripting natures of the Solidity language and the non-updateable feature of
blockchains. Hence, we surveyed 16 security vulnerabilities in smart contract
programs, and some vulnerabilities do not have a proper solution. This survey
aims to identify the key vulnerabilities in smart contracts on Ethereum in the
perspectives of their internal mechanisms and software security
vulnerabilities. By correlating 16 Ethereum vulnerabilities and 19 software
security issues, we predict that many attacks are yet to be exploited. And we
have explored many software tools to detect the security vulnerabilities of
smart contracts in terms of static analysis, dynamic analysis, and formal
verification. This survey presents the security problems in smart contracts
together with the available analysis tools and the detection methods. We also
investigated the limitations of the tools or analysis methods with respect to
the identified security vulnerabilities of the smart contracts.

<p>Video sharing platforms like YouTube are increasingly targeted by aggression
and hate attacks. Prior work has shown how these attacks often take place as a
result of "raids," i.e., organized efforts by ad-hoc mobs coordinating from
third-party communities. Despite the increasing relevance of this phenomenon,
however, online services often lack effective countermeasures to mitigate it.
Unlike well-studied problems like spam and phishing, coordinated aggressive
behavior both targets and is perpetrated by humans, making defense mechanisms
that look for automated activity unsuitable. Therefore, the de-facto solution
is to reactively rely on user reports and human moderation.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose an automated solution to identify YouTube videos
that are likely to be targeted by coordinated harassers from fringe communities
like 4chan. First, we characterize and model YouTube videos along several axes
(metadata, audio transcripts, thumbnails) based on a ground truth dataset of
videos that were targeted by raids. Then, we use an ensemble of classifiers to
determine the likelihood that a video will be raided with very good results
(AUC up to 94%). Overall, our work provides an important first step towards
deploying proactive systems to detect and mitigate coordinated hate attacks on
platforms like YouTube.

<p>Raised blood pressure is the most important risk factor in the global burden of disease.1 Although there is robust evidence to show that lowering blood pressure can substantially reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality,2 the global burden of hypertension is increasing.3,4 To achieve a reduction in the burden of disease related to hypertension, health systems must ensure that high blood pressure treatment and control rates are achieved. The status of controlled blood pressure is being promoted as a measure of universal health coverage, especially in the context of non-communicable diseases.

<p>One of the basic tenets of evidence-based medicine is that randomisation is crucial to understanding treatment effects. Observational studies are subject to confounding and selection bias. Researchers can adjust for measured differences between treatment groups, but unmeasured or unmeasurable differences might exist between groups that obscure true treatment effects and cannot be accounted for by any statistical method.1 The published medical literature is filled with examples of associations between treatment and outcome identified in observational studies that were subsequently disproven by well conducted randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Public cloud offers economy of scale to adapt workload changes in an autonomic manner, maximizing the use of resources. Through network function virtualization (NFV), network operators can move LTE core to the cloud; hence removing their dependency on carrier-grade LTE network functions. Recent research efforts discuss performance, latency, and fault tolerance of LTE NFV, largely ignoring the security aspects. In this paper, we discover new vulnerabilities that LTE NFV face today with no standard solutions to address them. These vulnerabilities span at both LTE control and user planes. To address them, we propose vEPC-sec that cryptographically secures LTE control-plane signaling messages in the cloud. It provides distributed key management and key derivation schemes to derive shared-symmetric keys for securing the communication between any two network functions. Our approach provides encryption and integrity protection to the messages even during virtual machines scalability and failure recovery scenarios. vEPC-sec also prevents user-plane vulnerabilities by ensuring that LTE routing modules should faithfully forward the LTE subscriber packets.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a self-guiding multimodal LSTM (sgLSTM) image captioning model is proposed to handle an uncontrolled imbalanced real-world image-sentence dataset. We collect a FlickrNYC dataset from Flickr as our testbed with 306,165 images and the original text descriptions uploaded by the users are utilized as the ground truth for training. Descriptions in the FlickrNYC dataset vary dramatically ranging from short term-descriptions to long paragraph-descriptions and can describe any visual aspects, or even refer to objects that are not depicted. To deal with the imbalanced and noisy situation and to fully explore the dataset itself, we propose a novel guiding textual feature extracted utilizing a multimodal LSTM (mLSTM) model. Training of mLSTM is based on the portion of data in which the image content and the corresponding descriptions are strongly bonded. Afterward, during the training of sgLSTM on the rest training data, this guiding information serves as additional input to the network along with the image representations and the ground-truth descriptions. By integrating these input components into a multimodal block, we aim to form a training scheme with the textual information tightly coupled with the image content. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed sgLSTM model outperforms the traditional state-of-the-art multimodal RNN captioning framework in successfully describing the key components of the input images.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Sonar imagery plays a significant role in oceanic applications since there is little natural light underwater, and light is irrelevant to sonar imaging. Sonar images are very likely to be affected by various distortions during the process of transmission via the underwater acoustic channel for further analysis. At the receiving end, the reference image is unavailable due to the complex and changing underwater environment and our unfamiliarity with it. To the best of our knowledge, one of the important usages of sonar images is target recognition on the basis of contour information. The contour degradation degree for a sonar image is relevant to the distortions contained in it. To this end, we developed a new no-reference contour degradation measurement for perceiving the quality of sonar images. The sparsities of a series of transform coefficient matrices, which are descriptive of contour information, are first extracted as features from the frequency and spatial domains. The contour degradation degree for a sonar image is then measured by calculating the ratios of extracted features before and after filtering this sonar image. Finally, a bootstrap aggregating (bagging)-based support vector regression module is learned to capture the relationship between the contour degradation degree and the sonar image quality. The results of experiments validate that the proposed metric is competitive with the state-of-the-art reference-based quality metrics and outperforms the latest reference-free competitors.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We present a deep architecture and learning framework for establishing correspondences across cross-spectral visible and infrared images in an unpaired setting. To overcome the unpaired cross-spectral data problem, we design the unified image translation and feature extraction modules to be learned in a joint and boosting manner. Concretely, the image translation module is learned only with the unpaired cross-spectral data, and the feature extraction module is learned with an input image and its translated image. By learning two modules simultaneously, the image translation module generates the translated image that preserves not only the domain-specific attributes with separate latent spaces but also the domain-agnostic contents with feature consistency constraint. In an inference phase, the cross-spectral feature similarity is augmented by intra-spectral similarities between the features extracted from the translated images. Experimental results show that this model outperforms the state-of-the-art unpaired image translation methods and cross-spectral feature descriptors on various visible and infrared benchmarks.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Top-down saliency detection aims to highlight the regions of a specific object category, and typically relies on pixel-wise annotated training data. In this paper, we address the high cost of collecting such training data by a weakly supervised approach to object saliency detection, where only image-level labels, indicating the presence or absence of a target object in an image, are available. The proposed framework is composed of two collaborative CNN modules, an image-level classifier and a pixel-level map generator. While the former distinguishes images with objects of interest from the rest, the latter is learned to generate saliency maps by which the images masked by the maps can be better predicted by the former. In addition to the top-down guidance from class labels, the map generator is derived by also exploring other cues, including the background prior, superpixel- and object proposal-based evidence. The background prior is introduced to reduce false positives. Evidence from superpixels helps preserve sharp object boundaries. The clue from object proposals improves the integrity of highlighted objects. These different types of cues greatly regularize the training process and reduces the risk of overfitting, which happens frequently when learning CNN models with few training data. Experiments show that our method achieves superior results, even outperforming fully supervised methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Cryo-electron microscopy provides 2D projection images of the 3D electron scattering intensity of many instances of the particle under study (e.g., a virus). Both symmetry (rotational point groups) and heterogeneity are important aspects of biological particles and both aspects can be combined by describing the electron scattering intensity of the particle as a stochastic process with a symmetric probability law and, therefore, symmetric moments. A maximum likelihood estimator implemented by an expectation&#x2013;maximization algorithm is described, which estimates the unknown statistics of the electron scattering intensity stochastic process from the images of instances of the particle. The algorithm is demonstrated on the bacteriophage HK97 and the virus  $text{N}omega text{V}$ . The results are contrasted with the existing algorithms, which assume that each instance of the particle has the symmetry rather than the less restrictive assumption that the probability law has the symmetry.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In cyberspace, evolutionary strategies are commonly used by both attackers and defenders. For example, an attacker's strategy often changes over the course of time, as new vulnerabilities are discovered and/or mitigated. Similarly, a defender's strategy changes over time. These changes may or may not be in direct response to a change in the opponent's strategy. In any case, it is important to have a set of quantitative metrics to characterize and understand the effectiveness of attackers' and defenders' evolutionary strategies, which reflect their cyber agility. Despite its clear importance, few systematic metrics have been developed to quantify the cyber agility of attackers and defenders. In this paper, we propose the first metric framework for measuring cyber agility in terms of the effectiveness of the dynamic evolution of cyber attacks and defenses. The proposed framework is generic and applicable to transform any relevant, quantitative, and/or conventional static security metrics (e.g., false positives and false negatives) into dynamic metrics to capture dynamics of system behaviors. In order to validate the usefulness of the proposed framework, we conduct case studies on measuring the evolution of cyber attacks and defenses using two real-world datasets. We discuss the limitations of the current work and identify future research directions.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Detection and isolation of single and mixed faults in a gearbox are very important to enhance the system reliability, lifetime, and service availability. This paper proposes a hybrid learning algorithm, consisting of multilayer perceptron (MLP)- and convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classifiers, for diagnosis of gearbox mixed faults. Domain knowledge features are required to train the MLP classifier, while the CNN classifier can learn features itself, allowing to reduce the required knowledge features for the counterpart. Vibration data from an experimental setup with gearbox mixed faults is used to validate the effectiveness of the algorithms and compare them with conventional methods. The comparative study shows that accuracies and robustness of the individual MLP and CNN algorithms are better than those of the compared methods and can be significantly improved using data fusion at the feature level. Furthermore, the robustness of the algorithm is secured under noises by combining the results of individual classifiers.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The deployment of smart hybrid heat pumps (SHHPs) can introduce considerable benefits to electricity systems via smart switching between electricity and gas while minimizing the total heating cost for each individual customer. In particular, the fully optimized control technology can provide flexible heat that redistributes the heat demand across time for improving the utilization of low-carbon generation and enhancing the overall energy efficiency of the heating system. To this end, an accurate quantification of the preheating is of great importance to characterize the flexible heat. This paper proposes a novel data-driven preheating quantification method to estimate the capability of the heat pump demand shifting and isolate the effect of interventions. Varieties of fine-grained data from a real-world trial are exploited to estimate the baseline heat demand using Bayesian deep learning while jointly considering epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. A comprehensive range of case studies are carried out to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed quantification method, and then, the estimated demand shift is used as an input into the whole-system model to investigate the system implications and quantify the range of benefits of rolling out the SHHPs developed by PassivSystems to the future GB electricity systems.

Stochastic modeling methods of smart homes explain random parameters and uncertainties of the aforementioned components. In this paper, a concise yet comprehensive analysis and comparison are presented for these techniques. First, modeling methods are implemented to find appropriate and precise forecasting models for PV, PEV, HP, and home load demand. Then, the accuracy of each model is validated by the real measured data. Finally, the pros and cons of each method are discussed and reviewed. The obtained results show the conditions under which the methods can provide a reliable and accurate description of smart home dynamics.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>At present, the fusion of different unimodal biometrics has attracted increasing attention from researchers, who are dedicated to the practical application of biometrics. In this paper, we explored a multi-biometric algorithm that integrates palmprints and dorsal hand veins (DHV). Palmprint recognition has a rather high accuracy and reliability, and the most significant advantage of DHV recognition is the biopsy (Liveness detection). In order to combine the advantages of both and implement the fusion method, deep learning and graph matching were, respectively, introduced to identify palmprint and DHV. Upon using the deep hashing network (DHN), biometric images can be encoded as 128-bit codes. Then, the Hamming distances were used to represent the similarity of two codes. Biometric graph matching (BGM) can obtain three discriminative features for classification. In order to improve the accuracy of open-set recognition, in multi-modal fusion, the score-level fusion of DHN and BGM was performed and authentication was provided by support vector machine (SVM). Furthermore, based on DHN, all four levels of fusion strategies were used for multi-modal recognition of palmprint and DHV. Evaluation experiments and comprehensive comparisons were conducted on various commonly used datasets, and the promising results were obtained in this case where the equal error rates (EERs) of both palmprint recognition and multi-biometrics equal 0, demonstrating the great superiority of DHN in biometric verification.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Touchless palmprint recognition systems enable high-accuracy recognition of individuals through less-constrained and highly usable procedures that do not require the contact of the palm with a surface. To perform this recognition, methods based on local texture descriptors and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are currently used to extract highly discriminative features while compensating for variations in scale, rotation, and illumination in biometric samples. In particular, the main advantage of CNN-based methods is their ability to adapt to biometric samples captured with heterogeneous devices. However, the current methods rely on either supervised training algorithms, which require class labels (e.g., the identities of the individuals) during the training phase, or filters pretrained on general-purpose databases, which may not be specifically suitable for palmprint data. To achieve a high-recognition accuracy with touchless palmprint samples captured using different devices while neither requiring class labels for training nor using pretrained filters, we introduce PalmNet, which is a novel CNN that uses a newly developed method to tune palmprint-specific filters through an unsupervised procedure based on Gabor responses and principal component analysis (PCA), not requiring class labels during training. PalmNet is a new method of applying Gabor filters in a CNN and is designed to extract highly discriminative palmprint-specific descriptors and to adapt to heterogeneous databases. We validated the innovative PalmNet on several palmprint databases captured using different touchless acquisition procedures and heterogeneous devices, and in all cases, a recognition accuracy greater than that of the current methods in this paper was obtained.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We propose a novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-inspired jamming and relaying scheme to enhance the physical layer security of untrusted relay networks. Particularly, during the first phase, with the application of the downlink NOMA principle, the source sends a superimposed version of a desired signal and a jamming signal, where the jamming signal is designed to deliberately confuse the untrusted relay by exploiting the beamforming design and adapting the transmission rate at the source. During the second phase, relying on the uplink NOMA principle, the untrusted relay forwards its received signals and, simultaneously, the source transmits a new desired signal that cannot be wiretapped by the untrusted relay to maximize the secrecy sum rate. Scenarios of single-antenna and multiple-antenna relaying are considered, and the impact of different antenna configurations at the source and the untrusted relay on the secrecy performance is investigated. Analytical expressions of an ergodic secrecy sum rate (ESSR) lower bound and an asymptotic ESSR scaling law are derived to evaluate the secrecy performance of the proposed NOMA-inspired jamming and relaying scheme. Computer simulations are presented to validate the accuracy of the derived analytical results, and demonstrate the significant ESSR improvement of the proposed scheme over the conventional orthogonal multiple access-based relaying schemes.
