<p>Blockchains have received much attention recently since they provide
decentralized approaches to the creation and management of value. Many banks,
Internet companies, car manufacturers, and even governments worldwide have
incorporated or started considering blockchains to improve the security,
scalability, and efficiency of their services. In this paper, we survey
blockchain applications in different areas. These areas include cryptocurrency,
healthcare, advertising, insurance, copyright protection, energy, and societal
applications. Our work provides a timely summary for individuals and
organizations interested in blockchains. We envision our study to motivate more
blockchain applications.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Local Differential Privacy (LDP) protocols enable an untrusted data collector
to perform privacy-preserving data analytics. In particular, each user locally
perturbs his/her data to preserve privacy before sending it to the data
collector, who aggregates the perturbed data to obtain statistics of interest.
Over the past several years, researchers from multiple communities--such as
security, database, and theoretical computer science-- have proposed many LDP
protocols. These studies mainly focused on improving the utility of the LDP
protocols. However, the security of LDP protocols is largely unexplored. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap. We focus on LDP protocols for frequency
estimation and heavy hitter identification, which are two basic data analytics
tasks. Specifically, we show that an attacker can inject fake users into an LDP
protocol and the fake users send carefully crafted data to the data collector
such that the LDP protocol estimates high frequencies for certain items or
identifies them as heavy hitters. We call our attacks data poisoning attacks.
We theoretically and/or empirically show the effectiveness of our attacks. We
also explore two countermeasures against our attacks. Our experimental results
show that they can effectively defend against our attacks in some scenarios but
have limited effectiveness in others, highlighting the needs for new defenses
against our attacks.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent research efforts on adversarial ML have investigated problem-space
attacks, focusing on the generation of real evasive objects in domains where,
unlike images, there is no clear inverse mapping to the feature space (e.g.,
software). However, the design, comparison, and real-world implications of
problem-space attacks remain underexplored. This paper makes two major
contributions. First, we propose a general formalization for adversarial ML
evasion attacks in the problem-space, which includes the definition of a
comprehensive set of constraints on available transformations, preserved
semantics, absent artifacts, and plausibility. We shed light on the
relationship between feature space and problem space, and we introduce the
concept of side-effect features as the by-product of the inverse
feature-mapping problem. This enables us to define and prove necessary and
sufficient conditions for the existence of problem-space attacks. We further
demonstrate the expressive power of our formalization by using it to describe
several attacks from related literature across different domains. Second,
building on our general formalization, we propose a novel problem-space attack
on Android malware that overcomes past limitations in terms of semantics and
artifacts. Experiments on a dataset with 170K Android apps from 2017 and 2018
show the practical feasibility of evading a state-of-the-art malware
classifier, DREBIN, along with its hardened version, Sec-SVM. Our results
demonstrate that "adversarial-malware as a service" is a realistic threat, as
we automatically generate thousands of realistic and inconspicuous adversarial
applications at scale, where on average it takes only a few minutes to generate
an adversarial app. Our formalization of problem-space attacks paves the way to
more principled research in this domain.

<p>Zero-knowledge proofs are an essential building block in many
privacy-preserving systems. However, implementing these proofs is tedious and
error-prone. In this paper, we present zksk, a well-documented Python library
for defining and computing sigma protocols: the most popular class of
zero-knowledge proofs. In zksk proofs compose: programmers can convert smaller
proofs into building blocks that then can be combined into bigger proofs. zksk
features a modern Python-based domain-specific language. This makes possible to
define proofs without learning a new custom language, and to benefit from the
rich Python syntax and ecosystem.

<p>We describe and evaluate an attack that reconstructs the histogram of any
target attribute of a sensitive dataset which can only be queried through a
specific class of real-world privacy-preserving algorithms which we call
bounded perturbation algorithms. A defining property of such an algorithm is
that it perturbs answers to the queries by adding zero-mean noise distributed
within a bounded (possibly undisclosed) range. Other key properties of the
algorithm include only allowing restricted queries (enforced via an online
interface), suppressing answers to queries which are only satisfied by a small
group of individuals (e.g., by returning a zero as an answer), and adding the
same perturbation to two queries which are satisfied by the same set of
individuals (to thwart differencing or averaging attacks). A real-world example
of such an algorithm is the one deployed by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics' (ABS) online tool called TableBuilder, which allows users to create
tables, graphs and maps of Australian census data [30]. We assume an attacker
(say, a curious analyst) who is given oracle access to the algorithm via an
interface. We describe two attacks on the algorithm. Both attacks are based on
carefully constructing (different) queries that evaluate to the same answer.
The first attack finds the hidden perturbation parameter $r$ (if it is assumed
not to be public knowledge). The second attack removes the noise to obtain the
original answer of some (counting) query of choice. We also show how to use
this attack to find the number of individuals in the dataset with a target
attribute value $a$ of any attribute $A$, and then for all attribute values
$a_i \in A$. Our attacks are a practical illustration of the (informal)
fundamental law of information recovery which states that ``overly accurate
estimates of too many statistics completely destroys privacy'' [9, 15].

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a new robust field-weakening approach for reluctance synchronous motors regulated by direct torque and flux control. Compared to the existing direct torque and flux control based field-weakening methods that cannot achieve maximized DC-link voltage utilization and are parameter dependent, the proposed approach contributes to improve the field-weakening performance of reluctance synchronous motor in two aspects. First, it extends the constant power speed range through autonomous stator flux reference adjustment, which maximizes the dc-link voltage utilization. Smooth transition between the maximum torque per ampere trajectory and field-weakening trajectory is also realized. Second, it enhances the parameter robustness of drives in very high-speed region by employing a torque reference adjustment scheme. This effectively avoids the instability of drives caused by machine parameter variations. The proposed approach is verified experimentally on a laboratory setup.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a new four-quadrant (4Q) boost-type converter with the use of active virtual ground (AVG) technology. The presented topology can step up the ac grid voltage to a regulated dc voltage under a stable bidirectional current flow and support the power transmission in either real power or reactive power delivery. With the use of the proposed modulation method, only two high-frequency switches are required through the 4Q operation. Under a full-bridge converter structure, an efficient system can be guaranteed. Also, benefiting from the AVG technology, an LCL filter is formed at the system input over the 4Q operation. Both magnitude of leakage current and grid current ripple are also minimized to a small value. Thus, a high-efficiency and low-noise 4Q converter is guaranteed. The presented topology is successfully implemented on a 750 VA prototype and the performance is experimentally verified on it, which shows good agreement with the theoretical knowledge.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Torque motor is one key component that directly influences the dynamic performance of jet pipe servo valve in aircraft. In this paper, a novel torque motor with hybrid-magnetization pole arrays is proposed. By changing the magnetization patterns of permanent magnets, the torque motor can significantly improve the output torque by range of 47&#x2013;52&#x0025; compared with traditional designs, while maintaining the system size and mass. The design concept and operating principle of the torque motor is presented. The magnetic field distribution is formulated analytically with equivalent magnetic circuit. Different from conventional study, the flux leakage of the permanent magnets and coils is included to improve the model precision. Subsequently, the output torque is derived mathematically from the airgap flux. Following that, the numerical calculation is conducted to validate the mathematical models of magnetic field and output torque. The design optimization is then carried out. One research prototype that can be mounted with either conventional magnet or the proposed hybrid array has been developed. The test rigs are constructed and experiments are conducted on the prototype. Both numerical computation and experimental results verify the significant improvement of torque generation of the proposed hybrid magnetization torque motor.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, the noncooperative optimal control problem is investigated for a class of discrete time-varying networked control systems subject to exogenous nonlinear disturbances. To relive the transmission burden in the sensor-to-controller channel, the Round-Robin protocol is adopted to schedule the sensor transmissions. On the other hand, the controller operates in an event-triggered manner so as to reduce the transmission frequency and thereby preserving the energy in the controller-to-actuator channel. In the presence of the underlying scheduling and triggering mechanism, it is literally impossible to acquire the accurate value of the individual cost function for each controller and, as an effective alternative, a certain upper bound is derived on the individual cost function. Then, in virtue of the completing-the-square technique and the Moore&#x2013;Penrose pseudo inverse, such an upper bound is minimized at each time instant. Furthermore, a sufficient condition is established to guarantee the boundedness of the derived upper bound over the infinite horizon. Finally, a numerical example on the power grid is provided to verify the validity of the proposed methodology.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to the limits on market requirements, material conditions, and production situations in manufacturing process, conventional optimization approaches are difficult to obtain optimal economical and technical indices with physical constraints. To optimize several conflicting objects such as production rate, economic benefits, and gas emission, a hybrid-model-based intelligent optimization method that consists of an improved genetic algorithm and derived deep learning is put forward in this paper. Integration of the hybrid model has made modeling and optimizing an indivisible whole, in which the fitness of the genetic algorithm comes from deep neural networks by weighted sum of the output variables that correspond to the input solutions. The recurrent neural network (RNN) with disposition-gated recurrent unit (dGRU) is applied to capture the dynamics of blast furnace by training the model over datasets recorded in the production scene. Meanwhile, the self-adaptive population genetic algorithm (SAPGA) with a varied population size depending on the fitness distribution is used to locate the optimal solutions under current working conditions. The hybrid intelligent optimization model, validated by both numerical tests and practical data, has been running in an ironmaking plant for one year. It has proved to be successful in meeting industry demands by optimizing multiproduction indices simultaneously.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Depth from focus (DfF) is a method of estimating the depth of a scene by using information acquired through changes in the focus of a camera. Within the DfF framework of, the focus measure (FM) forms the foundation which determines the accuracy of the output. With the results from the FM, the role of a DfF pipeline is to determine and recalculate unreliable measurements while enhancing those that are reliable. In this paper, we propose a new FM, which we call the &#x201c;ring difference filter&#x201d; (RDF), that can more accurately and robustly measure focus. FMs can usually be categorized as confident local methods or noise robust non-local methods. The RDF&#x2019;s unique ring-and-disk structure allows it to have the advantages of both local and non-local FMs. We then describe an efficient pipeline that utilizes the RDF&#x2019;s properties. Part of this pipeline is our proposed RDF-based cost aggregation method, which is able to robustly refine the initial results in the presence of image noise. Our method is able to reproduce results that are on par with or even better than those of state-of-the-art methods, while spending less time in computation.

<p>This Viewpoint discusses the importance of structuring value-based purchasing models around principles of physician professionalism to ensure that measures that lead to more payment are clinically meaningful, do not increase administrative burden, do not displace clinicians&#8217; intrinsic motivation to help patients with financial motivations, and do not incentivize physicians to avoid sicker, more complicated patients.

<p>An estimated 15 million babies are born prematurely, before 37 weeks of gestation, every year worldwide. Of those, about 5&#8211;6% are born extremely prematurely, before 28 weeks of gestation. Progress in the perinatal care of these babies has continued to improve outcomes in high-income countries. The British Association of Perinatal Medicine has issued new guidance, Perinatal Management of Extreme Preterm Birth before 27 weeks of gestation. For example, even at the lowest end of viability, at 22 weeks of gestation, 30% of those babies who were given active treatment survived to discharge in cohort studies from Sweden, the US, and Germany.

However, health inequity in New Zealand is persistent.1,2 The scarcity of tangible reductions in inequity between M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori populations raises questions about the effectiveness of policies to date.1&#8211;3 To address health inequity, New Zealand might need to revisit deep-rooted historical, cultural, and systemic issues.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We consider a decentralized detection network whose aim is to infer a public hypothesis of interest. However, the raw sensor observations also allow the fusion center to infer private hypotheses that we wish to protect. We consider the case where there are an uncountable number of private hypotheses belonging to an uncertainty set, and develop local privacy mappings at every sensor so that the sanitized sensor information minimizes the Bayes error of detecting the public hypothesis at the fusion center while achieving information privacy for all private hypotheses. We introduce the concept of a most favorable hypothesis (MFH) and show how to find an MFH in the set of private hypotheses. By protecting the information privacy of the MFH, information privacy for every other private hypothesis is also achieved. We provide an iterative algorithm to find the optimal local privacy mappings, and derive some theoretical properties of these privacy mappings. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach allows the fusion center to infer the public hypothesis with low error while protecting information privacy of all the private hypotheses.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The use of human biometrics is becoming widespread and its major application is human recognition for controlling unauthorized access to both digital services and physical localities. However, the practical deployment of human biometrics for recognition poses a number of challenges, such as template storage capacity, computational requirements, and privacy of biometric information. These challenges are important considerations, in addition to performance accuracy, especially for authentication systems with limited resources. In this paper, we propose a wave atom transform (WAT)-based palm-vein recognition scheme. The scheme computes, maintains, and matches palm-vein templates with less computational complexity and less storage requirements under a secure and privacy-preserving environment. First, we extract palm-vein traits in the WAT domain, which offers sparser expansion and better capability to extract texture features. Then, the randomization and quantization are applied to the extracted features to generate a compact, privacy-preserving palm-vein template. We analyze the proposed scheme for its performance and privacy-preservation. The proposed scheme obtains equal error rates (EERs) of 1.98%, 0%, 3.05%, and 1.49% for PolyU, PUT, VERA and our palm-vein datasets, respectively. The extensive experimental results demonstrate comparable matching accuracy of the proposed scheme with a minimum template size and computational time of 280 bytes and 0.43 s, respectively.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Massive MIMO attains high spectral and power efficiency transmission by leveraging a large number of transmit antennas. However, to capture the benefits of massive MIMO, each antenna should be accompanied with a dedicated RF chain, and consequently, the hardware costs would scale up tremendously with the increase of the antennas. Cheap implementations of massive MIMO have recently gained considerable attention, and constant modulus (CM) signaling is seen as a promising solution, owing to its low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). This paper investigates the physical-layer (PHY) security in massive MIMO with an emphasis on the CM signaling. In particular, we consider a transmitter with massive antennas broadcast common confidential information to a group of legitimate receivers, and a number of eavesdroppers overhear the transmission and attempt to intercept the information. Our goal is to design the CM beamforming at the transmitter so that the multicast secrecy rate is maximized. This secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is generally NP-hard. To tackle it, two tractable approaches are developed. The first one employs the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique and the Charnes-Copper transformation to obtain a convex relaxation of the SRM problem. However, due to the dimension lifting of SDR, this approach is feasible only for small to medium antenna sizes. The second approach leverages the Dinkelbach method to work directly over the beamformer domain; a custom-build nonconvex alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed to efficiently perform each Dinkelbach update. Simulation results demonstrate that the second approach is computationally more efficient and can achieve nearly optimal performance when the number of antennas is large.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the optimal tradeoff between secrecy and non-secrecy rates of the MISO wiretap channels for different power constraint settings: sum power constraint only, per-antenna power constraints only, and joint sum and per-antenna power constraints. The problem is motivated by the fact that channel capacity and secrecy capacity are generally achieved by different transmit strategies. First, a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure a positive secrecy capacity is shown. The optimal tradeoff between secrecy rate and transmission rate is characterized by a weighted rate sum maximization problem. Since this problem is not necessarily convex, equivalent problem formulations are introduced to derive the optimal transmit strategies. Under sum power constraint only, a closed-form solution is provided. Under per-antenna power constraints, necessary conditions to find the optimal power allocation are derived. Sufficient conditions are provided for the special case of two transmit antennas. For the special case of aligned channels, the optimal transmit strategies can deduced from an equivalent point-to-point channel problem. Last, the theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel deep sparse coding network (SCN) capable of efficiently adapting its own regularization parameters for a given application. The network is trained end-to-end with a supervised task-driven learning algorithm via error backpropagation. During training, the network learns both the dictionaries and the regularization parameters of each sparse coding layer so that the reconstructive dictionaries are smoothly transformed into increasingly discriminative representations. In addition, the adaptive regularization also offers the network more flexibility to adjust sparsity levels. Furthermore, we have devised a sparse coding layer utilizing a &#x201c;skinny&#x201d; dictionary. Integral to computational efficiency, these skinny dictionaries compress the high-dimensional sparse codes into lower dimensional structures. The adaptivity and discriminability of our 15-layer SCN are demonstrated on six benchmark datasets, namely Cifar-10, Cifar-100, STL-10, SVHN, MNIST, and ImageNet, most of which are considered difficult for sparse coding models. Experimental results show that our architecture overwhelmingly outperforms traditional one-layer sparse coding architectures while using much fewer parameters. Moreover, our multilayer architecture exploits the benefits of depth with sparse coding's characteristic ability to operate on smaller datasets. In such data-constrained scenarios, our technique demonstrates a highly competitive performance compared with the deep neural networks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A super-resolution optical imaging method is presented that relies on the distinct temporal information associated with each fluorescent optical reporter to determine its spatial position to high precision with measurements of heavily scattered light. This multiple-emitter localization approach uses a diffusion equation forward model in a cost function, and has the potential to achieve micron-scale spatial resolution through centimeters of tissue. Utilizing some degree of temporal separation for the reporter emissions, position and emission strength are determined using a computationally efficient temporal-scanning multiresolution algorithm. The approach circumvents the spatial resolution challenges faced by earlier optical imaging approaches by using a diffusion equation forward model, and is promising for in vivo applications. For example, in principle, the method could be used to localize individual neurons firing throughout a rodent brain, enabling the direct imaging of neural network activity.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We propose an algorithm to efficiently compute approximate solutions of the piecewise affine Mumford-Shah model. The algorithm is based on a novel reformulation of the underlying optimization problem in terms of Taylor jets. A splitting approach leads to linewise segmented jet estimation problems for which we propose an exact and efficient solver. The proposed method has the combined advantages of prior algorithms: it directly yields a partition, it does not need an initialization procedure, and it is highly parallelizable. The experiments show that the algorithm has lower computation times and that the solutions often have lower functional values than the state-of-the-art.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We present a method for synopsizing multiple videos captured by a set of surveillance cameras with some overlapped field-of-views. Currently, object-based approaches that directly shift objects along the time axis are already able to compute compact synopsis results for multiple surveillance videos. The challenge is how to present the multiple synopsis results in a more compact and understandable way. Previous approaches show them side by side on the screen, which however is difficult for user to comprehend. In this paper, we solve the problem by joint object-shifting and camera view-switching. Firstly, we synchronize the input videos, and group the same object in different videos together. Then we shift the groups of objects along the time axis to obtain multiple synopsis videos. Instead of showing them simultaneously, we just show one of them at each time, and allow to switch among the views of different synopsis videos. In this view switching way, we obtain just a single synopsis results consisting of content from all the input videos, which is much easier for user to follow and understand. To obtain the best synopsis result, we construct a simultaneous object-shifting and view-switching optimization framework instead of solving them separately. We also present an alternative optimization strategy composed of graph cuts and dynamic programming to solve the unified optimization. Experiments demonstrate that our single synopsis video generated from multiple input videos is compact, complete, and easy to understand.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Cost-effective task scheduling is an important operation in green infrastructure-as-a-service clouds (GICs) as the energy consumed by users' tasks is drastic. The irregular task arrival forces private GIC to adopt hybrid clouds to outsource some tasks to dynamic and reliable virtual machines (VMs) of public external clouds. However, temporal differences in revenue, electricity prices, wind and solar energy, and VM running prices of public external clouds make it difficult to dispatch all tasks in a cost-effective way while satisfying users' specified response time constraints. Unlike existing methods, we propose a multiqueue scheduling (MQS) method that investigates such temporal differences in hybrid GICs (HGICs). Specially, this work first gives mathematical relations between rejected tasks and service rates of servers in private GIC. In each iteration of MQS, this paper formulates a profit maximization problem for HGIC and solves it by a novel meta-heuristic optimization method by combing simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization, and genetic algorithm. Trace-driven experiments based on real-life data demonstrate that profit and throughput of MQS are larger than typical task scheduling algorithms while meeting tasks' response time constraints.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Understanding potential behaviors of attackers is of paramount importance for improving the cybersecurity of power systems. However, the attack behaviors in existing studies are often modeled statically on a single snapshot, which neglects the reality of a dynamically time-evolving power system. Accordingly, a dynamic cyber-attack model with local network information is proposed to characterize the typical data injection attack with the integration of potential dynamic behaviors of an attacker. The proposed model collaboratively alters the meter measurement in a stealthy way to illegally contaminate the system state, thus posing severe threats to cyber physical power systems. We then develop a novel anomaly detection countermeasure from the perspective of state estimation to effectively recognize the dynamic injection attack. In this countermeasure, an interval state forecasting method is proposed to approximate the possible largest variation bounds of each state variable based on a worst-case analysis considering the forecasting uncertainties of renewable energy sources, electric loads, and network parameter perturbations. In addition, the kernel quantile regression is introduced and implemented to formulate the uncertainties in renewable energy and electric load forecast as a series of confidence intervals. When any state variable falls outside its preforecasted intervals, the proposed countermeasure detects the anomaly and sets an alarm condition indicating the possibility of data contamination. Finally, the results from our extensive studies on several IEEE standard test systems have been presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the dynamic attack and the effectiveness of the detection countermeasure.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the rapid development of the internet of things (IoT), connected vehicles are set to become a huge industry over the next few years. In this study, we take an investigation of the distributed intelligent traffic system by pushing intelligence into connected vehicles in terms of dynamic decision making for traversing a certain area (e.g., roundabout and intersection). In particular, we propose a model for the next generation of intelligent transportation system, which focuses on dynamic decision making of connected vehicles based on Ant Colony Optimization, a typical Swarm Intelligence (SI)-based algorithm. Specifically, we first present a communication framework among connected vehicles for sharing information of traffic flow. Then, by applying the concept of SI, connected vehicles are regarded as artificial ants which are able to self-calculate to make an adaptive decision following the dynamics of traffic flow. Furthermore, for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we have constructed a framework to model and simulate the traffic system in IoT environment. Simulations with different scenarios of transportation systems indicate promising results comparing with previous works.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The postmobile era will go beyond using individual smart devices and allow for user interaction by connecting various devices with sensing capabilities, such as smartphones, wearable devices, automobiles, and the Internet of Things. Wearable devices can continuously collect a variety of information on the users and their environment as the devices are worn in daily life. Because of this, real-time big data analysis technology is needed. This paper proposes a deep learning-based ensemble network model for improving the performance and overcoming the problems, which can occur on a single network. This model is designed so that the features produced by n number of single networks are combined and relearned. In addition, different parameter values are used on each single network, and the data used in the experiments are generated by the fiducial point method, which uses feature point detection, and the nonfiducial point method for periods of 1 sec and n sec. In the experiment results, in the case of fiducial point-based ECG signals, the ensemble network recognition performance shows a maximum of 0.8% higher accuracy than that of the single network. In the case of a 1 sec period nonfiducial point-based ECG signal, the ensemble network recognition performance is a minimum of 0.4% and a maximum of 1% higher than that of the single network. In the case of an n sec period, there is a maximum difference of 1.3%, and the proposed ensemble network shows better performance than the single network.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Women tend to have a greater immune response to a flu vaccination compared to men, but their advantage largely disappears as they age and their estrogen levels decline, suggests a study from researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In a massive new analysis of findings from 277 clinical trials using 24 different interventions, Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers say they have found that almost all vitamin, mineral and other nutrient supplements or diets cannot be linked to longer life or protection from heart disease.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org">EurekAlert! - Breaking News</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>New research brings to light for the first time the evolution of maternal roles and parenting responsibilities in one of our oldest evolutionary ancestors. Australopithecus africanus mothers breastfed their infants for the first 12 months after birth, and continued to supplement their diets with breastmilk during periods of food shortage. Tooth chemistry analyses enable scientists to 'read' more than two-million-year-old teeth. Finding demonstrates why early human ancestors had fewer offspring and extended parenting role.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org">EurekAlert! - Breaking News</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A new study led by Dr. Antonella Fioravanti in the lab of Prof. Han Remaut (VIB-VUB Center for Structural Biology) has shown that removing the armor of the bacterium that causes anthrax slows its growth and negatively affects its ability to cause disease. This work will be published in the prestigious journal Nature Microbiology can lead the way to new, effective ways of fighting anthrax and various other diseases.
