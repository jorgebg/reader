<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In recent years, we have witnessed the unprecedented success of generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and its variants in image synthesis. These
techniques are widely adopted in synthesizing fake faces which poses a serious
challenge to existing face recognition (FR) systems and brings potential
security threats to social networks and media as the fakes spread and fuel the
misinformation. Unfortunately, robust detectors of these AI-synthesized fake
faces are still in their infancy and are not ready to fully tackle this
emerging challenge. Currently, image forensic-based and learning-based
approaches are the two major categories of strategies in detecting fake faces.
In this work, we propose an alternative category of approaches based on
monitoring neuron behavior. The studies on neuron coverage and interactions
have successfully shown that they can be served as testing criteria for deep
learning systems, especially under the settings of being exposed to adversarial
attacks. Here, we conjecture that monitoring neuron behavior can also serve as
an asset in detecting fake faces since layer-by-layer neuron activation
patterns may capture more subtle features that are important for the fake
detector. Empirically, we have shown that the proposed FakeSpotter, based on
neuron coverage behavior, in tandem with a simple linear classifier can greatly
outperform deeply trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spotting
AI-synthesized fake faces. Extensive experiments carried out on three deep
learning (DL) based FR systems, with two GAN variants for synthesizing fake
faces, and on two public high-resolution face datasets have demonstrated the
potential of the FakeSpotter serving as a simple, yet robust baseline for fake
face detection in the wild.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The Solitaire cipher was designed by Bruce Schneier as a plot point in the
novel Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson. The cipher is intended to fit the
archetype of a modern stream cipher whilst being implementable by hand using a
standard deck of cards with two jokers. We find a model for repetitions in the
keystream in the stream cipher Solitaire that accounts for the large majority
of the repetition bias. Other phenomena merit further investigation. We have
proposed modifications to the cipher that would reduce the repetition bias, but
at the cost of increasing the complexity of the cipher (probably beyond the
goal of allowing manual implementation). We have argued that the state update
function is unlikely to lead to cycles significantly shorter than those of a
random bijection.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We study the problem of estimating high dimensional models with underlying
sparse structures while preserving the privacy of each training example. We
develop a differentially private high-dimensional sparse learning framework
using the idea of knowledge transfer. More specifically, we propose to distill
the knowledge from a "teacher" estimator trained on a private dataset, by
creating a new dataset from auxiliary features, and then train a differentially
private "student" estimator using this new dataset. In addition, we establish
the linear convergence rate as well as the utility guarantee for our proposed
method. For sparse linear regression and sparse logistic regression, our method
achieves improved utility guarantees compared with the best known results
(Kifer et al., 2012; Wang and Gu, 2019). We further demonstrate the superiority
of our framework through both synthetic and real-world data experiments.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Contextual bandit algorithms (CBAs) often rely on personal data to provide
recommendations. This means that potentially sensitive data from past
interactions are utilized to provide personalization to end-users. Using a
local agent on the user's device protects the user's privacy, by keeping the
data locally, however, the agent requires longer to produce useful
recommendations, as it does not leverage feedback from other users. This paper
proposes a technique we call Privacy-Preserving Bandits (P2B), a system that
updates local agents by collecting feedback from other agents in a
differentially-private manner. Comparisons of our proposed approach with a
non-private, as well as a fully-private (local) system, show competitive
performance on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world data. Specifically, we
observed a decrease of 2.6% and 3.6% in multi-label classification accuracy,
and a CTR increase of 0.0025 in online advertising for a privacy budget
$\epsilon \approx$ 0.693. These results suggest P2B is an effective approach to
problems arising in on-device privacy-preserving personalization.

<p>We appreciate the comments by Jonathan Kennedy and colleagues referencing some of the challenges inherent in military engagement in global health. Kennedy and colleagues state that the Geneva Conventions have become outdated given the realities of current conflicts, and believe only a redefinition and redesign of international humanitarian law can address the weaknesses of the current system. We agree that new ways of war require re-envisioning international humanitarian law and a failure to fully adapt and broaden these requirements to current circumstances are key weaknesses.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Electricity theft is the third largest form of theft in the United States. It not only leads to significant revenue losses, but also creates the risk of fires and fatal electrical shocks. In the past, utilities have fought electricity theft by sending field operation groups to conduct physical inspections of electrical equipment based on suspicious activity reported by the public. However, the recent rapid penetration of advanced metering infrastructure makes it possible to detect electricity theft by analyzing the information gathered from smart meters. In this paper, we develop a physically inspired data driven model to detect electricity theft with smart meter data. The main advantage of the proposed model is that it only leverages the electricity usage and voltage data from smart meters instead of unreliable parameter and topology information of the secondary network. Hence, a speedy and widespread adoption of the proposed model is feasible. We show that a modified linear regression model accurately captures the physical relationship between electricity usage and voltage magnitude on the Kron-reduced distribution secondaries. Our results show that electricity theft on a distribution secondary will lead to negative and positive residuals from the regression for dishonest and honest customers, respectively. The proposed model is validated with real-world smart-meter data. The results show that the model is effective in identifying electricity theft cases.

<p>Fault diagnosis of a thermal system under varying operating conditions is of great importance for the safe and reliable operation of a power plant involved in peak shaving. However, it is a difficult task due to the lack of sufficient labeled data under some operating conditions. In practical applications, the model built on the labeled data under one operating condition will be extended to such operating conditions. Data distribution discrepancy can be triggered by variation of operating conditions and may degenerate the performance of the model. Considering the fact that data distributions are different but related under different operating conditions, this paper proposes a hierarchical deep domain adaptation (HDDA) approach to transfer a classifier trained on labeled data under one loading condition to identify faults with unlabeled data under another loading condition. In HDDA, a hierarchical structure is developed to reveal the effective information for final diagnosis by layerwisely capturing representative features. HDDA learns domain-invariant and discriminative features with the hierarchical structure by reducing distribution discrepancy and preserving discriminative information hidden in raw process data. For practical applications, the Taguchi method is used to obtain the optimized model parameters. Experimental results and comprehensive comparison analysis demonstrate its superiority.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a distributed fixed-time multiagent control strategy for the frequency restoration, voltage regulation, state of charge balancing, and proportional reactive power sharing between photovoltaic battery systems distributed in a microgrid with communication time delays. First, the feedback linearization method is applied to find the direct relationships between explicit states and control inputs. Then, based on the model, the distributed fixed-time cooperative control system restores the frequency, regulates the average voltage to the nominal value, and achieves accurate power sharing. For the state of charge balancing, a fixed-time observer is proposed to estimate the average state of charge of a battery using only information from neighbors. Based on the estimated value, a local fixed-time sliding mode control is applied to achieve the balanced state of charge. Due to robustness of the fixed-time control strategy, the balanced state of charge can be maintained despite intermittent photovoltaic generation and variable loads. The Artstein&#x0027;s transformation is applied to ensure the stability of the time delayed system. The dynamic performance is verified with an RTDS Technologies real-time digital simulator, using switching converter models, nonlinear lead-acid battery models, photovoltaic generation, and communication delays in a European benchmark microgrid.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A variable-gain finite-time convergent and noise-enduring zeroing neural network (VGFTNE-ZNN) is for the first time proposed for time-variant convex quadratic programming (QP). Differing from the existing finite-time convergent ZNNs with constant or variable design gains (i.e., CGFT-ZNN and VGFT-ZNN) that have limited noise-handling capabilities, the proposed VGFTNE-ZNN can endure additive noises by dynamically adjusting its design gains in finite time. Design gains of the unpolluted VGFTNE-ZNN are allowed to be constant when the QP problem is solved, whereas the design gain of the existing unpolluted VGFT-ZNN unrealistically increases to infinity when time evolves to infinity. Unlike existing polluted ZNNs with known noises involved, more practical unknown noises are successfully handled by the VGFTNE-ZNN. The finite-time convergence and noise-endurance properties of the VGFTNE-ZNN are mathematically proved based on the Lyapunov theory. Numerical verifications are comparatively performed with the superiorities of the VGFTNE-ZNN substantiated as compared with the existing CGFT-ZNN and VGFT-ZNN.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Current imbalance in multistring light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is a critical issue. It may cause overcurrent in one or more LED strings, leading to rapid degradation. In this paper, a mixed high-order compensation networks-based wireless power transfer system is proposed to generate multiple constant current outputs. It is composed of an LCC resonant network in the transmitting side, a series resonant network, and multiple CLC resonant rectifiers in the receiving side. The CLC resonant rectifiers are connected in parallel to form multiple independent output channels, and each channel is then connected to an LED string. Based on the analysis of the T resonant circuit and the modeling of coupling coils, multiple constant output currents can be derived. As a result, current balance can be achieved, which is very suitable for driving multistring LEDs. The proposed system also offers a modular, scalable, and maintenance-free design, which can significantly reduce the construction cost and the control complexity. In addition, the inverter in the transmitting side can achieve zero phase angle. A laboratory prototype with dual independent output currents is built to verify the proposed method. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical analysis.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Failure of the commutation process is a serious malfunction in line-commutated high-voltage direct current (HVdc) converters, which mainly occurs due to inverter ac faults and may lead to outage of the HVdc system. In this paper, an improved strategy is developed that functions based on the SIEMENS HVdc control system under normal conditions and switches to a designed commutation failure inhibition module (CFIM) during an inverter ac fault. From the response speed point of view, since the designed CFIM does not require any proportional-integral controller, the inverter control system has a quick performance in prevention of the commutation failure. This is achieved by direct measurement of the overlap area using the waveforms of the valves anode&#x2013;cathode and commuting voltages. In addition, from the accuracy aspect, the proposed method has a superior performance in comparison with the existing strategies. It is because of the fact that by direct measurement of the overlap area, variations of both direct current and the commutation inductance are considered, and hence, the unnecessary increase of the inverter reactive power consumption during the fault and the repetitive commutation failures are prevented. The practical performance and feasibility of the proposed strategy is validated through the laboratory testing, using the real-time Opal-RT hardware prototyping platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can effectively inhibit the commutation failure or repetitive commutation failures under different fault types by considering the lowest possible reactive power consumption.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a cable-driven exoskeleton device is developed for stroke patients to enable them to perform passive range of motion exercises and teleoperation rehabilitation of their impaired hands. Each exoskeleton finger is controlled by an actuator via two cables. The motions between the metacarpophalangeal and distal&#x002f;proximal interphalangeal joints are decoupled, through which the movement pattern is analogous to that observed in the human hand. A dynamic model based on the Lagrange method is derived to estimate how cable tension varies with the angular position of the finger joints. Two discernable phases are observed, each of which reflects the motion of the metacarpophalangeal and distal&#x002f;proximal interphalangeal joints. The tension profiles of exoskeleton fingers predicted by the Lagrange model are verified through a mechatronic integrated platform. The model can precisely estimate the tensions at different movement velocities, and it shows that the characteristics of two independent phases remain the same even for a variety of movement velocities. The feasibility for measuring resistance when manipulating a patient&#x0027;s finger is demonstrated in human experiments. Specifically, the net force required to move a subject&#x0027;s finger joints can be accounted for by the Lagrange model.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Oriented-plane curvature reproduction, the control of fingertip deformation by orientating a flat plate on contact points to generate a sensation of curvature, is one of the curvature reproduction methods with favorable effects. However, among the three geometric cues of curvature, only the zeroth- and first-order information is recovered with this method, whereas the second-order information (i.e., local curvature) is neglected due to the oriented plate&#x0027;s inherent characteristic of having a planar surface. The second-order information will change the contact length between the finger and the surface and thus affects the feeling. As a solution for this problem, this paper proposes to control the indentation depth of the finger pulp on the oriented plate such that the correct contact length is reproduced during the rendering. A finger wearable device is developed to control that indentation depth. Three psychophysical experiments are carried out and the results indicate that the second-order information plays a positive role in curvature rendering.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In a typical communication pipeline, images undergo a series of processing steps that can cause visual distortions before being viewed. Given a high quality reference image, a reference (R) image quality assessment (IQA) algorithm can be applied after compression or transmission. However, the assumption of a high quality reference image is often not fulfilled in practice, thus contributing to less accurate quality predictions when using stand-alone R IQA models. This is particularly common on social media, where hundreds of billions of user-generated photos and videos containing diverse, mixed distortions are uploaded, compressed, and shared annually on sites like Facebook, YouTube, and Snapchat. The qualities of the pictures that are uploaded to these sites vary over a very wide range. While this is an extremely common situation, the problem of assessing the qualities of compressed images against their pre-compressed, but often severely distorted (reference) pictures has been little studied. Towards ameliorating this problem, we propose a novel two-step image quality prediction concept that combines NR with R quality measurements. Applying a first stage of NR IQA to determine the possibly degraded quality of the source image yields information that can be used to quality-modulate the R prediction to improve its accuracy. We devise a simple and efficient weighted product model of R and NR stages, which combines a pre-compression NR measurement with a post-compression R measurement. This first-of-a-kind two-step approach produces more reliable objective prediction scores. We also constructed a new, first-of-a-kind dedicated database specialized for the design and testing of two-step IQA models. Using this new resource, we show that two-step approaches yield outstanding performance when applied to compressed images whose original, pre-compression quality covers a wide range of realistic distortion types and severities. The two-step concept is versatile as it can use -
ny desired R and NR components. We are making the source code of a particularly efficient model that we call 2stepQA publicly available at https://github.com/xiangxuyu/2stepQA. We are also providing the dedicated new two-step database free of charge at http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/twostep/index.html.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Image representation methods based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved the state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision tasks, such as image retrieval and person re-identification. We recognize that more discriminative feature embeddings can be learned with supervised deep metric learning and handcrafted features for image retrieval and similar applications. In this paper, we propose a new supervised deep feature embedding with a handcrafted feature model. To fuse handcrafted feature information into CNNs and realize feature embeddings, a general fusion unit is proposed (called Fusion-Net). We also define a network loss function with image label information to realize supervised deep metric learning. Our extensive experimental results on the Stanford online products&#x2019; data set and the in-shop clothes retrieval data set demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform the existing state-of-the-art methods of image retrieval by a large margin. Moreover, we also explore the applications of the proposed methods in person re-identification and vehicle re-identification; the experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Unpaired image-to-image translation problem aims to model the mapping from one domain to another with unpaired training data. Current works like the well-acknowledged Cycle GAN provide a general solution for any two domains through modeling injective mappings with a symmetric structure. While in situations where two domains are asymmetric in complexity, i.e., the amount of information between two domains is different, these approaches pose problems of poor generation quality, mapping ambiguity, and model sensitivity. To address these issues, we propose Asymmetric GAN (AsymGAN) to adapt the asymmetric domains by introducing an auxiliary variable (aux) to learn the extra information for transferring from the information-poor domain to the information-rich domain, which improves the performance of state-of-the-art approaches in the following ways. First, aux better balances the information between two domains which benefits the quality of generation. Second, the imbalance of information commonly leads to mapping ambiguity, where we are able to model one-to-many mappings by tuning aux, and furthermore, our aux is controllable. Third, the training of Cycle GAN can easily make the generator pair sensitive to small disturbances and variations while our model decouples the ill-conditioned relevance of generators by injecting aux during training. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed method both qualitatively and quantitatively on asymmetric situation, label-photo task, on Cityscapes and Helen datasets, and show many applications of asymmetric image translations. In conclusion, our AsymGAN provides a better solution for unpaired image-to-image translation in asymmetric domains.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we focus on restoring high-resolution facial images under noisy low-resolution scenarios. This problem is a challenging problem as the most important structures and details of captured facial images are missing. To address this problem, we propose a novel local patch-based face super-resolution (FSR) method via the joint learning of the contextual model. The contextual model is based on the topology consisting of contextual sub-patches, which provide more useful structural information than the commonly used local contextual structures due to the finer patch size. In this way, the contextual models are able to recover the missing local structures in target patches. In order to further strengthen the structural compensation function of contextual topology, we introduce the recognition feature as additional regularity. Based on the contextual model, we formulate the super-resolved procedure as a contextual joint representation with respect to the target patch and its adjacent patches. The high-resolution image is obtained by weighting contextual estimations. Both quantitative and qualitative validations show that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Clothing and carrying status variations are the two key factors that affect the performance of gait recognition because people usually wear various clothes and carry all kinds of objects, while walking in their daily life. These covariates substantially affect the intensities within conventional gait representations such as gait energy images. Hence, to properly compare a pair of input gait features, an appropriate metric for joint intensity is needed in addition to the conventional spatial metric. We therefore propose a unified joint intensity transformer network for gait recognition that is robust against various clothing and carrying statuses. Specifically, the joint intensity transformer network is a unified deep learning-based architecture containing three parts: a joint intensity metric estimation net, a joint intensity transformer, and a discrimination network. First, the joint intensity metric estimation net uses a well-designed encoder-decoder network to estimate a sample-dependent joint intensity metric for a pair of input gait energy images. Subsequently, a joint intensity transformer module outputs the spatial dissimilarity of two gait energy images using the metric learned by the joint intensity metric estimation net. Third, the discrimination network is a generic convolution neural network for gait recognition. In addition, the joint intensity transformer network is designed with different loss functions depending on the gait recognition task (i.e., a contrastive loss function for the verification task and a triplet loss function for the identification task). The experiments on the world's largest datasets containing various clothing and carrying statuses demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To contest the rapidly developing cyber-attacks, numerous collaborative security schemes, in which multiple security entities can exchange their observations and other relevant data to achieve more effective security decisions, are proposed and developed in the literature. However, the security-related information shared among the security entities may contain some sensitive information and such information exchange can raise privacy concerns, especially when these entities belong to different organizations. With such consideration, the interplay between the attacker and the collaborative entities is formulated as Quantitative Information Flow (QIF) games, in which the QIF theory is adapted to measure the collaboration gain and the privacy loss of the entities in the information sharing process. In particular, three games are considered, each corresponding to one possible scenario of interest in practice. Based on the game-theoretic analysis, the expected behaviors of both the attacker and the security entities are obtained. In addition, the simulation results are presented to validate the analysis.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The electroencephalography (EEG) method has recently attracted increasing attention in the study of brain activity-based biometric systems because of its simplicity, portability, noninvasiveness, and relatively low cost. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG, most of the existing EEG-based biometric systems require a long duration of signals to achieve high accuracy in individual identification. Besides, the feasibility and stability of these systems have not yet been conclusively reported, since most studies did not perform longitudinal evaluation. In this paper, we proposed a novel EEG-based individual identification method using code-modulated visualevoked potentials (c-VEPs). Specifically, this paper quantitatively compared eight code-modulated stimulation patterns, including six 63-bit (1.05 s at 60-Hz refresh rate) m-sequences (M1-M6) and two spatially combined sequence groups (M&#x00d7;4: M1-M4 and M&#x00d7; 6: M1-M6) in recording the c-VEPs from a group of 25 subjects for individual identification. To further evaluate the influence of inter-session variability, we recorded two data sessions for each individual on different days to measure intra-session and cross-session identification performance. State-of-the-art VEP detection algorithms in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) were employed to construct a template-matching-based identification framework. For intra-session identification, we achieved a 100% correct recognition rate (CRR) using 5.25-s EEG data (average of five trials for M5). For cross-session identification, 99.43% CRR was attained using 10.5-s EEG signals (average of ten trials for M5). These results suggest that the proposed c-VEP based individual identification method is promising for real-world applications.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>At present, the fusion of different unimodal biometrics has attracted increasing attention from researchers, who are dedicated to the practical application of biometrics. In this paper, we explored a multi-biometric algorithm that integrates palmprints and dorsal hand veins (DHV). Palmprint recognition has a rather high accuracy and reliability, and the most significant advantage of DHV recognition is the biopsy (Liveness detection). In order to combine the advantages of both and implement the fusion method, deep learning and graph matching were, respectively, introduced to identify palmprint and DHV. Upon using the deep hashing network (DHN), biometric images can be encoded as 128-bit codes. Then, the Hamming distances were used to represent the similarity of two codes. Biometric graph matching (BGM) can obtain three discriminative features for classification. In order to improve the accuracy of open-set recognition, in multi-modal fusion, the score-level fusion of DHN and BGM was performed and authentication was provided by support vector machine (SVM). Furthermore, based on DHN, all four levels of fusion strategies were used for multi-modal recognition of palmprint and DHV. Evaluation experiments and comprehensive comparisons were conducted on various commonly used datasets, and the promising results were obtained in this case where the equal error rates (EERs) of both palmprint recognition and multi-biometrics equal 0, demonstrating the great superiority of DHN in biometric verification.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Touchless palmprint recognition systems enable high-accuracy recognition of individuals through less-constrained and highly usable procedures that do not require the contact of the palm with a surface. To perform this recognition, methods based on local texture descriptors and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are currently used to extract highly discriminative features while compensating for variations in scale, rotation, and illumination in biometric samples. In particular, the main advantage of CNN-based methods is their ability to adapt to biometric samples captured with heterogeneous devices. However, the current methods rely on either supervised training algorithms, which require class labels (e.g., the identities of the individuals) during the training phase, or filters pretrained on general-purpose databases, which may not be specifically suitable for palmprint data. To achieve a high-recognition accuracy with touchless palmprint samples captured using different devices while neither requiring class labels for training nor using pretrained filters, we introduce PalmNet, which is a novel CNN that uses a newly developed method to tune palmprint-specific filters through an unsupervised procedure based on Gabor responses and principal component analysis (PCA), not requiring class labels during training. PalmNet is a new method of applying Gabor filters in a CNN and is designed to extract highly discriminative palmprint-specific descriptors and to adapt to heterogeneous databases. We validated the innovative PalmNet on several palmprint databases captured using different touchless acquisition procedures and heterogeneous devices, and in all cases, a recognition accuracy greater than that of the current methods in this paper was obtained.
