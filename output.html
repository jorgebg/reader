<p>Security analysts need to classify, search and correlate numerous images.
Automatic classification tools improve the efficiency of such tasks. However,
the main resources to develop these tools are datasets, which are introduced
and provided by the present paper, for the specific cases of visual correlation
of phishing and onion websites. CIRCL's Open-Source tools are the sources of
these screenshots, which had been manually verified against personal
information leaks. Usage examples of these datasets are proposed in the current
paper. These researches directions are, however, not the main contribution of
the paper. The main contribution is the availability of the two datasets.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Many organizations protect secure networked devices from non-secure networked
devices by assigning each class of devices to a different logical network.
These two logical networks, commonly called the host network and the guest
network, use the same router hardware, which is designed to isolate the two
networks in software.
</p>
<p>In this work we show that logical network isolation based on host and guest
networks can be overcome by the use of cross-router covert channels. Using
specially-crafted network traffic, these channels make it possible to leak data
between the host network and the guest network, and vice versa, through the use
of the router as a shared medium. We performed a survey of routers representing
multiple vendors and price points, and discovered that all of the routers we
surveyed are vulnerable to at least one class of covert channel. Our attack can
succeed even if the attacker has very limited permissions on the infected
device, and even an iframe hosting malicious JavaScript code can be used for
this purpose. We provide several metrics for the effectiveness of such
channels, based on their pervasiveness, rate and covertness, and discuss
possible ways of identifying and preventing these leakages.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recently, a medical privacy protection scheme (MPPS) based on DNA encoding
and chaos was proposed in [IEEE Trans. Nanobioscience, vol. 16, pp. 850--858,
2017]. This paper reports some properties of MPPS and proposes a
chosen-plaintext attack on it. In addition, the other claimed superiorities are
questioned from the viewpoint of modern cryptography. Both theoretical analysis
and experimental results are provided to support the feasibility of the attack
and other security defects. The proposed cryptanalysis will promote proper
application of DND encoding in protecting multimedia data including DICOM
image.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely used in many fields such as
images processing, speech recognition; however, they are vulnerable to
adversarial examples, and this is a security issue worthy of attention. Because
the training process of DNNs converge the loss by updating the weights along
the gradient descent direction, many gradient-based methods attempt to destroy
the DNN model by adding perturbations in the gradient direction. Unfortunately,
as the model is nonlinear in most cases, the addition of perturbations in the
gradient direction does not necessarily increase loss. Thus, we propose a
random directed attack (RDA) for generating adversarial examples in this paper.
Rather than limiting the gradient direction to generate an attack, RDA searches
the attack direction based on hill climbing and uses multiple strategies to
avoid local optima that cause attack failure. Compared with state-of-the-art
gradient-based methods, the attack performance of RDA is very competitive.
Moreover, RDA can attack without any internal knowledge of the model, and its
performance under black-box attack is similar to that of the white-box attack
in most cases, which is difficult to achieve using existing gradient-based
attack methods.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the great success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) towards representation
learning on graph-structure data, the robustness of GNNs against adversarial
attack inevitably becomes a central problem in graph learning domain.
Regardless of the fruitful progress, current works suffer from two main
limitations: First, the attack method required to be developed case by case;
Second, most of them are restricted to the white-box attack. This paper
promotes current frameworks in a more general and flexible sense -- we demand
only one single method to attack various kinds of GNNs and this attacker is
black box driven. To this end, we begin by investigating the theoretical
connections between different kinds of GNNs in a principled way and integrate
different GNN models into a unified framework, dubbed as General Spectral Graph
Convolution. As such, a generalized adversarial attacker is proposed towards
two families of GNNs: Convolution-based model and sampling-based model. More
interestingly, our attacker does not require any knowledge of the target
classifiers used in GNNs. Extensive experimental results validate the
effectiveness of our method on several benchmark datasets. Particularly by
using our attack, even small graph perturbations like one-edge flip is able to
consistently make a strong attack in performance to different GNN models.

<p>Asthma is a common chronic airway disease worldwide in children and adults.1,2 The prevalence of asthma is increasing in industrialised countries, whereas a rural upbringing has been shown to protect from allergies and asthma.3 China has developed from a traditional agricultural society into an industrialised country with dense populations in megacities and the accompanying challenges of air pollution. These rapidly changing lifestyle and environmental factors could affect the incidence and prevalence of asthma.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Clothing and carrying status variations are the two key factors that affect the performance of gait recognition because people usually wear various clothes and carry all kinds of objects, while walking in their daily life. These covariates substantially affect the intensities within conventional gait representations such as gait energy images. Hence, to properly compare a pair of input gait features, an appropriate metric for joint intensity is needed in addition to the conventional spatial metric. We therefore propose a unified joint intensity transformer network for gait recognition that is robust against various clothing and carrying statuses. Specifically, the joint intensity transformer network is a unified deep learning-based architecture containing three parts: a joint intensity metric estimation net, a joint intensity transformer, and a discrimination network. First, the joint intensity metric estimation net uses a well-designed encoder-decoder network to estimate a sample-dependent joint intensity metric for a pair of input gait energy images. Subsequently, a joint intensity transformer module outputs the spatial dissimilarity of two gait energy images using the metric learned by the joint intensity metric estimation net. Third, the discrimination network is a generic convolution neural network for gait recognition. In addition, the joint intensity transformer network is designed with different loss functions depending on the gait recognition task (i.e., a contrastive loss function for the verification task and a triplet loss function for the identification task). The experiments on the world&#x2019;s largest datasets containing various clothing and carrying statuses demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In many communication channels, secrecy constraints usually incur a penalty in capacity, as well as generalized degrees-of-freedom (GDoF). In this paper, we show an interesting observation that adding a helper can totally remove the penalty in sum GDoF for a two-user symmetric Gaussian interference channel. For the interference channel where each transmitter sends a message to an intended receiver without secrecy constraints, the sum GDoF is a well-known &#x201c;W&#x201d; curve, characterized by Etkin&#x2013;Tse&#x2013;Wang in 2008. If the secrecy constraints are imposed on this interference channel, where the message of each transmitter must be secure from the unintended receiver (eavesdropper), then a GDoF penalty is incurred and the secure sum GDoF is reduced to a modified &#x201c;W&#x201d; curve, derived by Chen recently. In this paper, we show that, by adding a helper into this interference channel with secrecy constraints, the secure sum GDoF turns out to be a &#x201c;W&#x201d; curve, which is the same as the sum GDoF of the setting without secrecy constraints. The proposed scheme is based on the cooperative jamming and a careful signal design such that the jamming signal of the helper is aligned at a specific direction and power level with the information signals of the transmitters, which allows us to totally remove the penalty in GDoF due to the secrecy constraints. Furthermore, the estimation approaches of noise removal and signal separation due to the rational independence are used in the secure rate analysis.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security of a full-duplex base station (BS)-aided system in the worst case, where an uplink transmitter (UT) and a downlink receiver (DR) are equipped with a single antenna, while a powerful eavesdropper is equipped with multiple antennas. For securing the confidentiality of signals transmitted from the BS and UT, an artificial noise (AN)-aided secrecy beamforming scheme is proposed, which is robust to the realistic imperfect state information of both the eavesdropping channel and the residual self-interference channel. Our objective function is that of maximizing the worst-case sum secrecy rate achieved by the BS and UT, through jointly optimizing the beamforming vector of the confidential signals and the transmit covariance matrix of the AN. However, the resulting optimization problem is non-convex and non-linear. In order to efficiently obtain the solution, we transform the non-convex problem into a sequence of convex problems by adopting the block coordinate descent algorithm. We invoke a linear matrix inequality for finding its Karush&#x2013;Kuhn&#x2013;Tucker (KKT) solution. In order to evaluate the achievable performance, the worst-case secrecy rate is analytically derived. Furthermore, we construct another secrecy transmission scheme using the projection matrix theory for performance comparison. Our simulation results show that the proposed robust secrecy transmission scheme achieves substantial secrecy performance gains, which verifies the efficiency of the proposed method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We propose a novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-inspired jamming and relaying scheme to enhance the physical layer security of untrusted relay networks. Particularly, during the first phase, with the application of the downlink NOMA principle, the source sends a superimposed version of a desired signal and a jamming signal, where the jamming signal is designed to deliberately confuse the untrusted relay by exploiting the beamforming design and adapting the transmission rate at the source. During the second phase, relying on the uplink NOMA principle, the untrusted relay forwards its received signals and, simultaneously, the source transmits a new desired signal that cannot be wiretapped by the untrusted relay to maximize the secrecy sum rate. Scenarios of single-antenna and multiple-antenna relaying are considered, and the impact of different antenna configurations at the source and the untrusted relay on the secrecy performance is investigated. Analytical expressions of an ergodic secrecy sum rate (ESSR) lower bound and an asymptotic ESSR scaling law are derived to evaluate the secrecy performance of the proposed NOMA-inspired jamming and relaying scheme. Computer simulations are presented to validate the accuracy of the derived analytical results, and demonstrate the significant ESSR improvement of the proposed scheme over the conventional orthogonal multiple access-based relaying schemes.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In cyberspace, evolutionary strategies are commonly used by both attackers and defenders. For example, an attacker&#x2019;s strategy often changes over the course of time, as new vulnerabilities are discovered and/or mitigated. Similarly, a defender&#x2019;s strategy changes over time. These changes may or may not be in direct response to a change in the opponent&#x2019;s strategy. In any case, it is important to have a set of quantitative metrics to characterize and understand the effectiveness of attackers&#x2019; and defenders&#x2019; evolutionary strategies, which reflect their cyber agility. Despite its clear importance, few systematic metrics have been developed to quantify the cyber agility of attackers and defenders. In this paper, we propose the first metric framework for measuring cyber agility in terms of the effectiveness of the dynamic evolution of cyber attacks and defenses. The proposed framework is generic and applicable to transform any relevant, quantitative, and/or conventional static security metrics (e.g., false positives and false negatives) into dynamic metrics to capture dynamics of system behaviors. In order to validate the usefulness of the proposed framework, we conduct case studies on measuring the evolution of cyber attacks and defenses using two real-world datasets. We discuss the limitations of the current work and identify future research directions.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>AC&#x2013;DC light-emitting diode (LED) drivers suffer from short lifetime because of the low-lifetime electrolytic capacitors used for dc bus decoupling. In this paper, a primary-side peak current control method applied for driving a two-stage multichannel LED driver is proposed. The LED driver consists of an ac&#x2013;dc boost power factor correction stage and an isolated dc&#x2013;dc nonresonant stage. A long-lifetime and small film capacitor is used for implementing the intermediate dc bus. The proposed method, which controls the peak value of the primary-side current of the transformers, is applied to the dc&#x2013;dc stage to ensure constant dc current output of LEDs in spite of the widely varying dc bus voltage due to low bus capacitance. The proposed method compensates the effect of the large dc bus voltage ripple by varying the switching frequency of the primary-side switches. Detailed design procedure, theoretical analysis, and experimental results of the LED driver operating at 180 W with the proposed method are provided. The LED driver with the proposed control method is proved to have high overall efficiency.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The objective of this paper is to develop a method for assisting users to push power-assisted wheelchairs (PAWs) in such a way that the electrical energy consumption over a predefined distance-to-go is optimal, while at the same time bringing users to a desired fatigue level. This assistive task is formulated as an optimal control problem and solved by Feng et al. using the model-free approach gradient of partially observable Markov decision processes. To increase the data efficiency of the model-free framework, we here propose to use policy learning by weighting exploration with the returns (PoWER) with 25 control parameters. Moreover, we provide a new near-optimality analysis of the finite-horizon fuzzy Q-iteration, which derives a model-based baseline solution to verify numerically the near-optimality of the presented model-free approaches. Simulation results show that the PoWER algorithm with the new parameterization converges to a near-optimal solution within 200 trials and possesses the adaptability to cope with changes of the human fatigue dynamics. Finally, 24 experimental trials are carried out on the PAW system, with fatigue feedback provided by the user via a joystick. The performance tends to increase gradually after learning. The results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness and the feasibility of PoWER in our application.

The interference and sensitive characteristics of components in printed circuit board (PCB) of cell phones are analyzed, and the knowledge graph for these interference and sensitive units is established for the first time. In the knowledge graph, the interference and sensitive units are stored as entities and new triple functions are defined to associate these entities. The EMC management report is intelligently generated based on the knowledge graph from interactive&#x00a0;sessions, in which long short-term memory and multilayer perceptron methods are used to extract the entities and key parameters of the triple function. The accuracy of the entity extraction model is 75.6&#x0025;, and F1 measure is 70.9&#x0025;.

<p>Recent years have witnessed the promising future of hashing in the industrial applications for fast similarity retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised hashing method for large-scale cross-media search, termed self-supervised deep multimodal hashing (SSDMH), which learns unified hash codes as well as deep hash functions for different modalities in a self-supervised manner. With the proposed regularized binary latent model, unified binary codes can be solved directly without relaxation strategy while retaining the neighborhood structures by the graph regularization term. Moreover, we propose a new discrete optimization solution, termed as binary gradient descent, which aims at improving the optimization efficiency toward real-time operation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets demonstrate the superiority of SSDMH over state-of-the-art cross-media hashing approaches.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Video saliency detection aims to continuously discover the motion-related salient objects from the video sequences. Since it needs to consider the spatial and temporal constraints jointly, video saliency detection is more challenging than image saliency detection. In this paper, we propose a new method to detect the salient objects in video based on sparse reconstruction and propagation. With the assistance of novel static and motion priors, a single-frame saliency model is first designed to represent the spatial saliency in each individual frame via the sparsity-based reconstruction. Then, through a progressive sparsity-based propagation, the sequential correspondence in the temporal space is captured to produce the inter-frame saliency map. Finally, these two maps are incorporated into a global optimization model to achieve spatio-temporal smoothness and global consistency of the salient object in the whole video. The experiments on three large-scale video saliency datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms both qualitatively and quantitatively.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose an efficient inter prediction scheme by introducing the deep virtual reference frame (VRF), which serves better reference in the temporal redundancy removal process of video coding. In particular, the high quality VRF is generated with the deep learning-based frame rate up conversion (FRUC) algorithm from two reconstructed bi-directional frames, which is subsequently incorporated into the reference list serving as the high quality reference. Moreover, to alleviate the compression artifacts of VRF, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based enhancement model to further improve its quality. To facilitate better utilization of the VRF, a CTU level coding mode termed as direct virtual reference frame (DVRF) is devised, which achieves better trade-off between compression performance and complexity. The proposed scheme is integrated into HM-16.6 and JEM-7.1 software platforms, and the simulation results under random access (RA) configuration demonstrate significant superiority of the proposed method. When adding VRF to RPS, more than 6&#x0025; average BD-rate gain is achieved for HEVC test sequences on HM-16.6, and 0.8&#x0025; BD-rate gain is observed based on JEM-7.1 software. Regarding the DVRF mode, 3.6&#x0025; bitrate saving is achieved on HM-16.6 with the computational complexity effectively reduced.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Singular value thresholding (SVT)- or nuclear norm minimization (NNM)-based nonlocal image denoising methods often rely on the precise estimation of the noise variance. However, most existing methods either assume that the noise variance is known or require an extra step to estimate it. Under the iterative regularization framework, the error in the noise variance estimate propagates and accumulates with each iteration, ultimately degrading the overall denoising performance. In addition, the essence of these methods is still least squares estimation, which can cause a very high mean-squared error (MSE) and is inadequate for handling missing data or outliers. In order to address these deficiencies, we present a hybrid denoising model based on variational Bayesian inference and Stein&#x2019;s unbiased risk estimator (SURE), which consists of two complementary steps. In the first step, the variational Bayesian SVT performs a low-rank approximation of the nonlocal image patch matrix to simultaneously remove the noise and estimate the noise variance. In the second step, we modify the conventional SURE full-rank SVT and its divergence formulas for rank-reduced eigen-triplets to remove the residual artifacts. The proposed hybrid BSSVT method achieves better performance in recovering the true image compared with state-of-the-art methods.

<p>The ability to recognize actions throughout a video is essential for surveillance, self-driving, and many other applications. Although many researchers have investigated deep neural networks to get a better result in video action recognition, these networks usually require a large number of well-labeled data to train. In this paper, we introduce a dense dilated network to collect action information from snippet-level to global-level. The dilated dense network is composed of the blocks with densely connected dilated convolutions layers. Our proposed framework is capable of fusing outputs from each layer to learn high-level representations, and these representations are robust even with only a few training snippets. We study different spatial and temporal modality fusing configurations and introduce a novel temporal guided fusion upon the dense dilated network which can further boost the performance. We conduct extensive experiments on two popular video action datasets: UCF101 and HMDB51. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Representing images by compact hash codes is an attractive approach for large-scale content-based image retrieval. In most state-of-the-art hashing-based image retrieval systems, for each image, local descriptors are first aggregated as a global representation vector. This global vector is then subjected to a hashing function to generate a binary hash code. In previous works, the aggregating and the hashing processes are designed independently. Hence, these frameworks may generate suboptimal hash codes. In this paper, we first propose a novel unsupervised hashing framework in which feature aggregating and hashing are designed simultaneously and optimized jointly. Specifically, our joint optimization generates aggregated representations that can be better reconstructed by some binary codes. This leads to more discriminative binary hash codes and improved retrieval accuracy. In addition, the proposed method is flexible. It can be extended for supervised hashing. When the data label is available, the framework can be adapted to learn binary codes which minimize the reconstruction loss with respect to label vectors. Furthermore, we also propose a fast version of the state-of-the-art hashing method Binary Autoencoder to be used in our proposed frameworks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets under various settings show that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised hashing methods.

<p>Over the last decade, the idea of population health management (PHM) has become increasingly embraced among US health care leaders and policy makers. By encouraging multisectoral collaboration, coordination with community services, and nonclinical interventions, many policy makers believe that we can both save money and save lives.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Industrial and commercial electricity customers have significant potential in providing flexibility for power systems through diverse demand response (DR) programs. However, the industrial and commercial potential of DR is not yet completely understood, especially regarding the emerging and advanced technologies associated with the smart grid. Advances in smart meter technology that allow monitoring and controlling responsive loads in real time will also be key enablers of DR potential. It can be more complex to implement DR for industrial loads if compared to residential loads mainly due to the reliability management that is more vital for industrial plants. Hence, this paper aims at providing a comprehensive review of the most recent advances on industrial and commercial DR. On this basis, this survey first presents the potential and technologies of DR in industrial and commercial sectors. Then, the existing models of DR in the mentioned sectors are presented. The presence of industrial and commercial DR in electricity markets is also investigated. Finally, the main positive and beneficial aspects, as well as challenges and barriers of industrial and commercial DR, are investigated.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>It is widely agreed that future manufacturing environments will be populated by humans and robots sharing the same workspace. However, the real collaboration can be sporadic, especially in the case of assembly tasks, which might involve autonomous operations to be executed by either the robot or the human worker. In this scenario, it might be beneficial to predict the actions of the human in order to control the robot both safely and efficiently. In this paper, we propose a method to predict human activity patterns in order to early infer when a specific collaborative operation will be requested by the human and to allow the robot to perform alternative autonomous tasks in the meanwhile. The prediction algorithm is based on higher-order Markov chains and is experimentally verified in a realistic scenario involving a dual-arm robot employed in a small part collaborative assembly task.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes an optimal power scheduling strategy for cooperative operation of multiple-coupled microgrids, where the microgrid coalition makes day-ahead energy exchange commitments with the grid. Deviations from their commitments are limited by penalizing the microgrids. Various system intermittencies are captured via scenarios. The framework aims at maximizing the expected profit of each microgrid, while mitigating the distribution power losses by enabling local power trades between all microgrids within a coalition. The scheduling problem only utilizes the power exchange requests as the control signals between participating microgrids. Extensive numerical results are presented to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The growing number of attacks against cyber-physical systems in recent years elevates the concern for cybersecurity of industrial control systems (ICSs). The current efforts of ICS cybersecurity are mainly based on firewalls, data diodes, and other methods of intrusion prevention, which may not be sufficient for growing cyber threats from motivated attackers. To enhance the cybersecurity of ICS, a cyber-attack detection system built on the concept of defense-in-depth is developed utilizing network traffic data, host system data, and measured process parameters. This attack detection system provides multiple-layer defense in order to gain the defenders precious time before unrecoverable consequences occur in the physical system. The data used for demonstrating the proposed detection system are from a real-time ICS testbed. Five attacks, including man in the middle (MITM), denial of service (DoS), data exfiltration, data tampering, and false data injection, are carried out to simulate the consequences of cyber attack and generate data for building data-driven detection models. Four classical classification models based on network data and host system data are studied, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree, bootstrap aggregating (bagging), and random forest (RF), to provide a secondary line of defense of cyber-attack detection in the event that the intrusion prevention layer fails. Intrusion detection results suggest that KNN, bagging, and RF have low missed alarm and false alarm rates for MITM and DoS attacks, providing accurate and reliable detection of these cyber attacks. Cyber attacks that may not be detectable by monitoring network and host system data, such as command tampering and false data injection attacks by an insider, are monitored for by traditional process monitoring protocols. In the proposed detection system, an auto-associative kernel regression model is studied to strengthen early attack detection. The result shows that this approach de-
ects physically impactful cyber attacks before significant consequences occur. The proposed multiple-layer data-driven cyber-attack detection system utilizing network, system, and process data is a promising solution for safeguarding an ICS.
