<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The classical Bloom filter data structure is a crucial component of hundreds of cryptographic protocols. It has been used in privacy preservation and secure computation settings, often in conjunction with the (somewhat) homomorphic properties of ciphers such as Paillier's. In 2014, a new data structure extending and surpassing the capabilities of the classical Bloom filter has been proposed. The new primitive, called spatial Bloom filter (SBF) retains the hash-based membership-query design of the Bloom filter, but applies it to elements from multiple sets. Since its introduction, the SBF has been used in the design of cryptographic protocols for a number of domains, including location privacy and network security. However, due to the complex nature of this probabilistic data structure, its properties had not been fully understood. In this paper, we address this gap in knowledge and we fully explore the probabilistic properties of the SBF. In doing so, we define a number of metrics (such as emersion and safeness) useful in determining the parameters needed to achieve certain characteristics in a filter, including the false positive probability and inter-set error rate. This will in turn enable the design of more efficient cryptographic protocols based on the SBF, opening the way to their practical application in a number of security and privacy settings.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we consider the design of a new secure transmission scheme for a four-node relay-eavesdropper channel, where user cooperation is used to facilitate secure communications. The key idea of the proposed achievable scheme is to apply the compression relaying concept of noisy network coding (NNC) to the secrecy communication scenario. But different from the original non-secrecy NNC, the compression rate at the relay is adaptively chosen according to the eavesdropping channel. Particularly, helping interference information is injected into the compression codebook at the relay by simply enlarging the compression rate, which is to effectively suppress the eavesdropping channel. Closed-form expressions of the secrecy rates achieved by the proposed NNC-based secure scheme are characterized for both the discrete memoryless and Gaussian relay-eavesdropper channels, where the optimal compression rate and the optimal transmit power at the relay are also determined. The proposed secure scheme can be viewed as a general framework, which naturally combines the NNC compression relaying scheme with the interference-assisted scheme. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed secure scheme offers constant performance gains over typical existing cooperative secure schemes.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In copy-and-paste image forgeries, where image content is copied from one image and pasted into another, inconsistencies in an imaging feature called lateral chromatic aberration (LCA) are intrinsically introduced. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to detect forged image regions that is based on detecting localized LCA inconsistencies. To do this, we propose a statistical model that captures the inconsistency between global and local estimates of LCA. We then use this model to pose forgery detection as a hypothesis testing problem and derive a detection statistic, which we show is optimal when certain conditions are met. To test its detection efficacy, we conduct a series of experiments that demonstrate our proposed methodology significantly outperforms prior art and addresses deficiencies of previous research. Additionally, we propose a new and efficient LCA estimation algorithm. To accomplish this we adapt a block matching algorithm, called diamond search, which efficiently measures the LCA in a localized region. We experimentally show that our proposed estimation algorithm reduces estimation time by two orders of magnitude without introducing additional estimation error.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fingerprints have been extensively used for biometric recognition around the world. However, fingerprints are not secrets, and an adversary can synthesis a fake finger to spoof the biometric system. The mainstream of the current fingerprint spoof detection methods are basically binary classifier trained on some real and fake samples. While they perform well on detecting fake samples created by using the same methods used for training, their performance degrades when encountering fake samples created by a novel spoofing method. In this paper, we approach the problem from a different perspective by incorporating electrocardiogram (ECG). Compared with the conventional biometrics, stealing someone&#x2019;s ECG is far more difficult if not impossible. Considering that ECG is a vital signal and motivated by its inherent liveness, we propose to combine it with a fingerprint liveness detection algorithm. The combination is natural as both ECG and fingerprints can be captured from fingertips. In the proposed framework, the ECG and fingerprint are combined not only for authentication purpose but also for liveness detection. We also examine automatic template updating using ECG and fingerprint. In addition, we propose a stopping criterion that reduces the average waiting time for signal acquisition. We have performed extensive experiments on the LivDet2015 database which is presently the latest available liveness detection database and compare the proposed method with six liveness detection methods as well as 12 participants of LivDet2015 competition. The proposed system has achieved a liveness detection equal error rate (EER) of 4.2&#x0025; incorporating only 5 s of ECG. By extending the recording time to 30 s, liveness detection EER reduces to 2.6&#x0025; which is about 4 times better than the best of six comparison methods. This is also about 2 times better than the best results achieved by the participants of the LivDet2015 competition.

<p>The mobile-health (M-Health) system, also known as the wireless body area network for remote patient monitoring, is a system which can remotely monitor a real-time human body&#x2019;s health status parameters. Generalized signcryption can realize encryption, signature, and signcryption with only one key pair and one algorithm. To address the communication security requirement for M-Health system, Zhang et al. proposed a light-weight secure data transmission protocol for M-Health system by using a certificateless generalized signcryption (CLGSC) scheme recently. In this paper, we point out that an insider attack exists in Zhang et al.&#x2019;s CLGSC scheme, which destroys the confidentiality of the scheme. Thus, their light-weight and robust security-aware D2D-assist data transmission protocol for mobile-health system is insecure, too.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This study adopts the method of third-order harmonic voltage injection (THVI) to move the peak value of a reference voltage toward the high capacitor voltage and increase the utilization rate of the capacitor voltage. This method can lower the cost or enlarge the capacity of a modular multilevel converter (MMC) when applied in high-voltage direct-current transmission. In this paper, the principle of THVI is introduced. Two calculation methods for modulation waves are studied, and the mathematical expressions of the capacitor voltage under all operating conditions are deduced. Thus, the optimal magnitude and phase of the third-order harmonic voltage are determined under all operating conditions. The mathematical expressions of the optimal magnitude and phase of the third-order harmonic voltage are obtained, and their online calculation burden is reduced. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method of THVI is feasible and effective.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a single-switch single power-conversion (S$^text{3}$ PC) power factor correction (PFC) converter. Using the series-resonant circuit, the S $^text{3}$PC converter provides bidirectional core excitation for the transformer and obtains higher power capability compared with the conventional single-switch PFC converters. Also, the series-resonant circuit provides zero-current switching turn-off for the output diodes, so that the reverse-recovery loss is alleviated. The regenerative snubber not only avoids the voltage spike of the switch but also recycles the absorbed energy. Because these features are obtained with only a single switch and through single power-conversion, the S$^text{3}$PC converter has high efficiency and simple structure. The control algorithm derived from feedback linearization enables the S$^text{3}$PC converter to obtain good controllability. Also, by using this control algorithm, the proposed converter performs both PFC control and output power control through single power-conversion. With these advantages, the S $^text{3}$PC converter provides maximum efficiency of 96.4&#x0025; and high power factor in excess of 0.994. The proposed converter is theoretically analyzed in detail, and experimental results are applied to a 1-kW prototype to show its validity.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper develops a novel voltage equalizer by combining wireless power transfer (WPT) and a voltage multiplier (VM) for series-connected energy storage cells. The physical isolation achieved by WPT can offer several unique benefits that traditional equalizers can hardly provide. In this paper, the characteristics of a multiple-output VM are analytically discussed and used to develop an equivalent one-output VM model. Based on this model, parameters of the WPT system are properly designed. The proposed design methodology can achieve a single-switch voltage equalizer without feedback control, which dramatically decreases the circuit complexity and cost. Moreover, this methodology can naturally ensure a robust system under small coil misalignment. In the experiment, the proposed system is built to balance four series-connected ultracapacitor modules. The system efficiency is 72.8&#x0025; at a load power level of 10 W.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction and state-of-health (SOH) diagnosis are of extreme importance for safety, durability, and cost of energy storage systems based on lithium-ion batteries. It is also a crucial challenge for energy storage systems to predict RUL and diagnose SOH of batteries due to the complicated aging mechanism. In this paper, a novel method for battery RUL prediction and SOH estimation is proposed. First, a novel support vector regression-based battery SOH state-space model is established to simulate the battery aging mechanism, which takes the capacity as the state variable and takes the representative features during a constant-current and constant-voltage protocol as the input variables. The estimated impedance variables are taken as the output due to the correlation between battery capacity and the sum of charge transfer resistance and electrolyte resistance. Second, in order to suppress the measurement noises of current and voltage, a particle filter is employed to estimate the impedance degradation parameters. Furthermore, experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method. The results show that the proposed SOH estimation method can provide an accurate and robustness result. The proposed RUL prediction framework can also ensure an accurate RUL prediction result.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>As more and more data become available for machine prognostic analysis in the big data environment, effective data suitability assessment methods become highly desired to help locate data with sufficient quality for analysis. Driven by this purpose, this paper proposes a novel and systematic methodology for data suitability assessment based on the needs of prognostics and health management (PHM). In this study, the data suitability for PHM is assessed from the aspects of detectability, diagnosability, and trendability, which correspond to the three major tasks of PHM: fault detection, fault diagnosis, and degradation assessment. The proposed methodology is mainly built upon the recent research studies on maximum mean discrepancy in the field of machine learning, which include a family of test statistics that are used to test the difference between two data distributions. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated in diverse industrial applications, which include semiconductors, boring tool degradation, and sensorless drive diagnosis. The results in the case studies indicate that the proposed methodology can be a promising tool to evaluate whether the data under study or the extracted feature set is suitable for PHM tasks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Component pick-and-place technology has been widely used to improve production efficiency and reduce common defects. The vision-driven measurement system of a component pick-and-place machine requires an appropriate positioning algorithm with low computational complexity, high accuracy, and high generalizability. To satisfy these attributes is rather challenging. This paper focuses on the online component positioning problem based on corner points. Thus, we propose a robust, accurate, and efficient universal algorithm that incorporates preprocessing, coarse positioning, and fine positioning stages. Two types of model key points are introduced for interpreting the model component. To enhance positioning accuracy and robustness against illumination changes, the Harris corners and subpixel corner points are extracted from the images of real components. In the coarse positioning step, distance and shape feature matching methods are introduced to, respectively, compute the coarse and correct correspondences between type I model key points and Harris corner points. After the corresponding point pairs have been obtained, the coarse and fine positioning problems are formulated as least squares error problems. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by applying the method in several real component positioning experiments.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a System-on-Chip design for real-time satellites photovoltaic curves telemetry. In these applications, the limitation of memory and communication bandwidth makes quite difficult to store and to transmit the whole characteristic current-voltage (I-V) curve of any solar section in real-time. The proposed solution is based on the real-time calculation of the equivalent single-diode model of the solar section. The single-diode model fits accurately the behavior of any solar panel, so once the parameters are calculated, saved, and transmitted, at any working conditions, that specific curve could be later reproduced. The system is based on a LEON3 32-bit microprocessor core implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array. The LEON microprocessors were originally designed by the European Space Agency, Paris, France, to be used in space projects where high reliability is required. In addition, in order to design the system as simple and reliable as possible, from all the methods available in the literature to extract the five parameters of the equivalent model, the Oblique Asymptote Method has been chosen for its simplicity and precision. Finally, some experimental results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the final system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Downtime is a key performance index for industrial automation systems. An industrial automation system achieves maximum productivity when its downtime is reduced to the minimum. One approach to minimize downtime is to predict system faults and recover from them automatically. A cloud-based decision support system is proposed for rapid problem identifications and to assist the self-management processes. By running multiple parallel simulations of control software with real-time inputs ahead of system time, faults could be detected and corrected automatically using autonomous industrial software agents. Fault trees, as well as control algorithms, are modeled using IEC 61499 function blocks that can be directly executed on both physical controllers and cloud services. A case study of water heating process is used to demonstrate the self-healing process supported by the cloud-based decision support system.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Smart grids (SG) energy management system and electric vehicle (EV) have gained considerable reputation in recent years. This has been enabled by the high growth of EVs on roads; however, this may lead to a significant impact on the power grids. In order to keep EVs far from causing peaks in power demand and to manage building energy during the day, it is important to perform an intelligent scheduling for EVs charging and discharging service and buildings areas by including different metrics, such as real-time price and demand&#x2013;supply curve. In this paper, we propose a real-time dynamic pricing model for EVs charging and discharging service and building energy management, in order to reduce the peak loads. Our proposed approach uses a decentralized cloud computing architecture based on software define networking (SDN) technology and network function virtualization (NFV). We aim to schedule user&#x0027;s requests in a real-time way and to supervise communications between microgrids controllers, SG and user entities (i.e., EVs, electric vehicles public supply stations, advance metering infrastructure, smart meters, etc.). We formulate the problem as a linear optimization problem for EV and a global optimization problem for all microgrids. We solve the problems by using different decentralized decision algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that proposes a pricing model based on decentralized Cloud-SDN architecture in order to solve all the aforementioned issues. The extensive simulations and comparisons with related works proved that our proposed pricing model optimizes the energy load during peak hours, maximizes EVs utility, and maintains the microgrid stability. The simulation is based on real electric load of the city of Toronto.

<p>A warm light suffuses an empty stage surrounded by nine pianos. A young woman walks to the front and she is caught by a panic attack. Thus the new production of Tennessee Williams' Summer and Smoke, directed by Rebecca Frecknall at London's Almeida Theatre, begins. Written in 1948, just after the success of A Streetcar Named Desire, the play, in its deceptive simplicity, touches some of the key themes of Williams' early works: the marginalisation of women in the southern states of the USA, the dichotomy between spirituality and carnality, and the lability of mental health.

<p>The insurgency by the Boko Haram terrorist group in northeast Nigeria has had devastating effects on the region including thousands of deaths, internal displacement, destruction of private and public properties, and considerable economic ruin. The violent conflict perpetuated by the group also has public health implications and has affected the spread and management of HIV, which remains a huge public health issue in Nigeria.

<p>Our research into the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA)'s delivery of health services to Palestinian refugees during the Syria crisis1 puts us in a unique position to anticipate the challenges of the organisation's current funding crisis.2 We have conducted over 90 interviews with health workers and managers, a series of systems modelling sessions, and rigorous analysis of UNRWA health data from 2007&#8211;16, and conclude the following.
