<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we develop four malware detection methods using Hamming
distance to find similarity between samples which are first nearest neighbors
(FNN), all nearest neighbors (ANN), weighted all nearest neighbors (WANN), and
k-medoid based nearest neighbors (KMNN). In our proposed methods, we can
trigger the alarm if we detect an Android app is malicious. Hence, our
solutions help us to avoid the spread of detected malware on a broader scale.
We provide a detailed description of the proposed detection methods and related
algorithms. We include an extensive analysis to asses the suitability of our
proposed similarity-based detection methods. In this way, we perform our
experiments on three datasets, including benign and malware Android apps like
Drebin, Contagio, and Genome. Thus, to corroborate the actual effectiveness of
our classifier, we carry out performance comparisons with some state-of-the-art
classification and malware detection algorithms, namely Mixed and Separated
solutions, the program dissimilarity measure based on entropy (PDME) and the
FalDroid algorithms. We test our experiments in a different type of features:
API, intent, and permission features on these three datasets. The results
confirm that accuracy rates of proposed algorithms are more than 90% and in
some cases (i.e., considering API features) are more than 99%, and are
comparable with existing state-of-the-art solutions.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Traditional single-factor authentication possesses several critical security
vulnerabilities due to single-point failure feature. Multi-factor
authentication (MFA), intends to enhance security by providing additional
verification steps. However, in practical deployment, users often experience
dissatisfaction while using MFA, which leads to non-adoption. In order to
understand the current design and usability issues with MFA, we analyze
aggregated user generated comments (N = 12,500) about application-based MFA
tools from major distributors, such as, Amazon, Google Play, Apple App Store,
and others. While some users acknowledge the security benefits of MFA, majority
of them still faced problems with initial configuration, system design
understanding, limited device compatibility, and risk trade-offs leading to
non-adoption of MFA. Based on these results, we provide actionable
recommendations in technological design, initial training, and risk
communication to improve the adoption and user experience of MFA.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A myriad of access control policy languages have been and continue to be
proposed. The design of policy miners for each such language is a challenging
task that has required specialized machine learning and combinatorial
algorithms. We present an alternative method, universal access control policy
mining (Unicorn). We show how this method streamlines the design of policy
miners for a wide variety of policy languages including ABAC, RBAC, RBAC with
user-attribute constraints, RBAC with spatio-temporal constraints, and an
expressive fragment of XACML. For the latter two, there were no known policy
miners until now.
</p>
<p>To design a policy miner using Unicorn, one needs a policy language and a
metric quantifying how well a policy fits an assignment of permissions to
users. From these, one builds the policy miner as a search algorithm that
computes a policy that best fits the given permission assignment. We
experimentally evaluate the policy miners built with Unicorn on logs from
Amazon and access control matrices from other companies. Despite the genericity
of our method, our policy miners are competitive with and sometimes even better
than specialized state-of-the-art policy miners. The true positive rates of
policies we mined differ by only 5% from the policies mined by the state of the
art and the false positive rates are always below 5%. In the case of ABAC, it
even outperforms the state of the art.

<p>The importance of training robust neural network grows as 3D data is
increasingly utilized in deep learning for vision tasks, like autonomous

necessary in understanding how neural networks can be exploited, and thus
defended. More specifically, we propose adversarial attacks based on solving
different optimization problems, like minimizing the perceptibility of our
generated adversarial examples, or maintaining a uniform density distribution
of points across the adversarial object surfaces. Our four proposed algorithms
for attacking 3D point cloud classification are all highly successful on
existing neural networks, and we find that some of them are even effective

<p>Recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown
increasing success in generating photorealistic images. But they also raise
challenges to visual forensics and model attribution. We present the first
study of learning GAN fingerprints towards image attribution and using them to
classify an image as real or GAN-generated. For GAN-generated images, we
further identify their sources. Our experiments show that (1) GANs carry
distinct model fingerprints and leave stable fingerprints in their generated
images, which support image attribution; (2) even minor differences in GAN
training can result in different fingerprints, which enables fine-grained model
authentication; (3) fingerprints persist across different image frequencies and
patches and are not biased by GAN artifacts; (4) fingerprint finetuning is
effective in immunizing against five types of adversarial image perturbations;
and (5) comparisons also show our learned fingerprints consistently outperform
several baselines in a variety of setups.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Family health history (FHH) is the most useful means of assessing risk for common chronic diseases. The odds ratio for risk of developing disease with a positive FHH is frequently greater than 2, and actions can be taken to mitigate risk by adhering to screening guidelines, genetic counselling, genetic risk testing, and other screening methods. Challenges to the routine acquisition of FHH include constraints on provider time to collect data and the difficulty in accessing risk calculators. Disease-specific and broader risk assessment software platforms have been developed, many with clinical decision support and informatics interoperability, but few access patient information directly.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A key problem in co-saliency detection is how to effectively model the interactive relationship of a whole image group and the individual perspective of each image in a united data-driven manner. In this paper, we propose a group-wise deep co-saliency detection approach to address the co-saliency object discovery problem based on the fully convolutional network (FCN). The proposed approach captures the group-wise interaction information for group images by learning a semantics-aware image representation based on a convolutional neural network, which adaptively learns the group-wise features for co-saliency detection. Furthermore, the proposed approach discovers the collaborative and interactive relationships between group-wise feature representation and single-image individual feature representation and models this in a collaborative learning framework. Then, we set up a unified deep learning scheme to jointly optimize the process of group-wise feature representation learning and collaborative learning, leading to more reliable and robust co-saliency detection results. Finally, we present a graph Laplacian regularized nonlinear regression model for saliency refinement. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Motion compensation has been widely employed for removing temporal redundancies in typical hybrid video coding framework. The popular video compression standards, such as H.264/AVC and HEVC, adopt the block-based partitioning model to describe the motion field due to its high-compression efficiency and relatively low-computational complexity. However, block-based motion compensation may not align with the actual object motion boundaries, potentially limiting the compression efficiency. In view of this, we propose a three-zone segmentation-based motion compensation scheme to improve the description accuracy of motion field as well as the coding efficiency. In particular, the segmentation information is implied in the reference frame instead of being explicitly signalled. Based on the segmentation information, three motion compensation zones can be identified, including one edge, one foreground, and one background zone. The foreground zone is motion compensated by the signalled motion vector of the block, and the background zone is motion compensated by the motion information implicitly derived from the local motion field. Regarding the edge zone, it is viewed as an overlapped area and the weighted compensation strategy is adopted. The proposed algorithm is implemented into the reference software VTM-1.0 of versatile video coding (VVC), and the simulation results show that the algorithm can achieve 1.14&#x0025; and 1.06&#x0025; bitrate savings for random access and low-delay configurations, respectively.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Developing an automatic age estimation method toward human faces continues to possess an important role in computer vision and pattern recognition. Many studies regarding facial age estimation mainly focus on two aspects: facial aging feature extraction and classification/regression model learning. To set our work apart from existing age estimation approaches, we consider a different aspect&#x2014;system structuring, which is under a constrained condition: given a fixed feature type and a fixed learning method, how to design a framework to improve the age estimation performance based on the constraint? We propose a four-stage fusion framework for facial age estimation. This framework starts from gender recognition, then goes to the second phase, gender-specific age grouping, followed by the third stage, age estimation within age groups, and finally ends at the fusion stage. In the experiment, three well-known benchmark datasets, MORPH-II, FG-NET, and CLAP2016, are adopted to validate the procedure. The experimental results show that the performance can be significantly improved by using our proposed framework and this framework also outperforms several state-of-the-art age estimation methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we present a novel approach to find informative and anomalous samples in videos exploiting the concept of typicality from information theory. In most video analysis tasks, selection of the most informative samples from a huge pool of training data in order to learn a good recognition model is an important problem. Furthermore, it is also useful to reduce the annotation cost, as it is time-consuming to annotate unlabeled samples. Typicality is a simple and powerful technique, which can be applied to compress the training data to learn a good classification model. In a continuous video clip, an activity shares a strong correlation with its previous activities. We assume that the activity samples that appear in a video form a Markov chain. We explicitly show how typicality can be utilized in this scenario. We compute an atypical score for a sample using typicality and the Markovian property, which can be applied to two challenging vision problems: 1) sample selection for learning activity recognition models and 2) anomaly detection. In the first case, our approach leads to a significant reduction in manual labeling cost while achieving similar or better recognition performance compared with a model trained with the entire training set. For the latter case, the atypical score has been exploited in identifying anomalous activities in videos, where our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework over other recent strategies.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Participatory sensing is a crowdsourcing-based framework, where the platform executes the sensing requests with the help of many common peoples&#x2019; handheld devices (typically smartphones). In this paper, we mainly address the online sensing request admission and smartphone selection problem to maximize the profit of the platform, taking into account the queue backlog, and the location of sensing requests and smartphones. First, we formulate this problem as a discrete time model and design a location aware online admission and selection control algorithm (LAAS) based on the Lyapunov optimization technique. The LAAS algorithm only depends on the currently available information and makes all the control decisions independently and simultaneously. Next, we utilize the recent advancement of the accurate prediction of smartphones&#x2019; mobility and sensing request arrival information in the next few time slots and develop a predictive location aware admission and selection control algorithm (PLAAS). We further design a greedy predictive location aware admission and selection control algorithm (GPLAAS) to achieve the online implementation of PLAAS approximately and iteratively. Theoretical analysis shows that under any control parameter V &gt; 0, both LAAS and PLAAS algorithm can achieve O(1&#x002f;V)-optimal average profit, while the sensing request backlog is bounded by O(V). Extensive numerical results based on both synthetic and real trace show that LAAS outperforms the Greedy algorithm and Random algorithm and GPLAAS improves the profit-backlog tradeoff over LAAS.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper addresses fully distributed formation control problems for high-order linear multiagent systems (MASs) with directed communication topology. In order to overcome the shortcomings of designing time-varying formation (TVF) protocols via the global information of the communication network and the full states of all the agents in existing formation results, a novel adaptive TVF protocol is developed. First, dynamic output feedback information and sequential observers are used to construct the adaptive TVF protocol. Then, a distributed algorithm which includes a TVF feasibility constraint is proposed. Only local outputs of neighboring agents are used in the algorithm. Moreover, applying the proposed approach and the Lyapunov stability theory, it is found that the fully distributed TVF can be achieved. Finally, numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the theoretical results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The deployment of smart hybrid heat pumps (SHHPs) can introduce considerable benefits to electricity systems via smart switching between electricity and gas while minimizing the total heating cost for each individual customer. In particular, the fully optimized control technology can provide flexible heat that redistributes the heat demand across time for improving the utilization of low-carbon generation and enhancing the overall energy efficiency of the heating system. To this end, an accurate quantification of the preheating is of great importance to characterize the flexible heat. This paper proposes a novel data-driven preheating quantification method to estimate the capability of the heat pump demand shifting and isolate the effect of interventions. Varieties of fine-grained data from a real-world trial are exploited to estimate the baseline heat demand using Bayesian deep learning while jointly considering epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. A comprehensive range of case studies are carried out to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed quantification method, and then, the estimated demand shift is used as an input into the whole-system model to investigate the system implications and quantify the range of benefits of rolling out the SHHPs developed by PassivSystems to the future GB electricity systems.

Stochastic modeling methods of smart homes explain random parameters and uncertainties of the aforementioned components. In this paper, a concise yet comprehensive analysis and comparison are presented for these techniques. First, modeling methods are implemented to find appropriate and precise forecasting models for PV, PEV, HP, and home load demand. Then, the accuracy of each model is validated by the real measured data. Finally, the pros and cons of each method are discussed and reviewed.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper investigates the residential energy management problems in the power-heat-coupling system. For better solving this issue, based on the novel concept of We-Energy (WE) for energy Internet (EI), this paper proposes a residential WE (R-WE) framework faced by the terminal users who play an important role in renewable energy consumption. Inspired by the full-duplex feature of R-WE, the power and heat supply-demand balance constraints are fulfilled in a regional unit of EI, but it may be inequality constraints for corresponding consumer, producer, or WE operation modes in only one R-WE. The R-WE framework can be classified into four operation modes, which is island mode, consumer mode, producer mode, and WE mode. On this basis, the R-WE models cooperate to achieve the objective of minimizing the operation costs, smoothing out the loads&#x2019; variations, and renewable resource fluctuations. Specifically, the R-WE framework with respect to the heat-power-coupling problem can be solved in the distributed double-consensus algorithm (DDCA), which is designed two sets of consensus algorithms by using four completely different consensus variables to calculate the power and heat multipliers, evaluate the power and heat generations and, thereby, further obtain the power mismatches of electricity and heat. Also, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimal conditions of the proposed DDCA is further proved. Meanwhile, a novel projection operation method for combined heat and power devices is designed to take the infeasible solutions mapped into the feasible region. Finally, the simulation results in different cases further demonstrate that the proposed R-WE frame can be an appropriate method to analyze the terminal consumers and harmonize multienergy producers in the process of constructing EI projects. And an R-WE framework of the campus has experimented with minority loads in island mode.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Clothing and carrying status variations are the two key factors that affect the performance of gait recognition because people usually wear various clothes and carry all kinds of objects, while walking in their daily life. These covariates substantially affect the intensities within conventional gait representations such as gait energy images. Hence, to properly compare a pair of input gait features, an appropriate metric for joint intensity is needed in addition to the conventional spatial metric. We therefore propose a unified joint intensity transformer network for gait recognition that is robust against various clothing and carrying statuses. Specifically, the joint intensity transformer network is a unified deep learning-based architecture containing three parts: a joint intensity metric estimation net, a joint intensity transformer, and a discrimination network. First, the joint intensity metric estimation net uses a well-designed encoder-decoder network to estimate a sample-dependent joint intensity metric for a pair of input gait energy images. Subsequently, a joint intensity transformer module outputs the spatial dissimilarity of two gait energy images using the metric learned by the joint intensity metric estimation net. Third, the discrimination network is a generic convolution neural network for gait recognition. In addition, the joint intensity transformer network is designed with different loss functions depending on the gait recognition task (i.e., a contrastive loss function for the verification task and a triplet loss function for the identification task). The experiments on the world&#x2019;s largest datasets containing various clothing and carrying statuses demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security of a full-duplex base station (BS)-aided system in the worst case, where an uplink transmitter (UT) and a downlink receiver (DR) are equipped with a single antenna, while a powerful eavesdropper is equipped with multiple antennas. For securing the confidentiality of signals transmitted from the BS and UT, an artificial noise (AN)-aided secrecy beamforming scheme is proposed, which is robust to the realistic imperfect state information of both the eavesdropping channel and the residual self-interference channel. Our objective function is that of maximizing the worst-case sum secrecy rate achieved by the BS and UT, through jointly optimizing the beamforming vector of the confidential signals and the transmit covariance matrix of the AN. However, the resulting optimization problem is non-convex and non-linear. In order to efficiently obtain the solution, we transform the non-convex problem into a sequence of convex problems by adopting the block coordinate descent algorithm. We invoke a linear matrix inequality for finding its Karush&#x2013;Kuhn&#x2013;Tucker (KKT) solution. In order to evaluate the achievable performance, the worst-case secrecy rate is analytically derived. Furthermore, we construct another secrecy transmission scheme using the projection matrix theory for performance comparison. Our simulation results show that the proposed robust secrecy transmission scheme achieves substantial secrecy performance gains, which verifies the efficiency of the proposed method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Touchless palmprint recognition systems enable high-accuracy recognition of individuals through less-constrained and highly usable procedures that do not require the contact of the palm with a surface. To perform this recognition, methods based on local texture descriptors and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are currently used to extract highly discriminative features while compensating for variations in scale, rotation, and illumination in biometric samples. In particular, the main advantage of CNN-based methods is their ability to adapt to biometric samples captured with heterogeneous devices. However, the current methods rely on either supervised training algorithms, which require class labels (e.g., the identities of the individuals) during the training phase, or filters pretrained on general-purpose databases, which may not be specifically suitable for palmprint data. To achieve a high-recognition accuracy with touchless palmprint samples captured using different devices while neither requiring class labels for training nor using pretrained filters, we introduce PalmNet, which is a novel CNN that uses a newly developed method to tune palmprint-specific filters through an unsupervised procedure based on Gabor responses and principal component analysis (PCA), not requiring class labels during training. PalmNet is a new method of applying Gabor filters in a CNN and is designed to extract highly discriminative palmprint-specific descriptors and to adapt to heterogeneous databases. We validated the innovative PalmNet on several palmprint databases captured using different touchless acquisition procedures and heterogeneous devices, and in all cases, a recognition accuracy greater than that of the current methods in this paper was obtained.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We propose a novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-inspired jamming and relaying scheme to enhance the physical layer security of untrusted relay networks. Particularly, during the first phase, with the application of the downlink NOMA principle, the source sends a superimposed version of a desired signal and a jamming signal, where the jamming signal is designed to deliberately confuse the untrusted relay by exploiting the beamforming design and adapting the transmission rate at the source. During the second phase, relying on the uplink NOMA principle, the untrusted relay forwards its received signals and, simultaneously, the source transmits a new desired signal that cannot be wiretapped by the untrusted relay to maximize the secrecy sum rate. Scenarios of single-antenna and multiple-antenna relaying are considered, and the impact of different antenna configurations at the source and the untrusted relay on the secrecy performance is investigated. Analytical expressions of an ergodic secrecy sum rate (ESSR) lower bound and an asymptotic ESSR scaling law are derived to evaluate the secrecy performance of the proposed NOMA-inspired jamming and relaying scheme. Computer simulations are presented to validate the accuracy of the derived analytical results, and demonstrate the significant ESSR improvement of the proposed scheme over the conventional orthogonal multiple access-based relaying schemes.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In cyberspace, evolutionary strategies are commonly used by both attackers and defenders. For example, an attacker&#x2019;s strategy often changes over the course of time, as new vulnerabilities are discovered and/or mitigated. Similarly, a defender&#x2019;s strategy changes over time. These changes may or may not be in direct response to a change in the opponent&#x2019;s strategy. In any case, it is important to have a set of quantitative metrics to characterize and understand the effectiveness of attackers&#x2019; and defenders&#x2019; evolutionary strategies, which reflect their cyber agility. Despite its clear importance, few systematic metrics have been developed to quantify the cyber agility of attackers and defenders. In this paper, we propose the first metric framework for measuring cyber agility in terms of the effectiveness of the dynamic evolution of cyber attacks and defenses. The proposed framework is generic and applicable to transform any relevant, quantitative, and/or conventional static security metrics (e.g., false positives and false negatives) into dynamic metrics to capture dynamics of system behaviors. In order to validate the usefulness of the proposed framework, we conduct case studies on measuring the evolution of cyber attacks and defenses using two real-world datasets. We discuss the limitations of the current work and identify future research directions.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>AC&#x2013;DC light-emitting diode (LED) drivers suffer from short lifetime because of the low-lifetime electrolytic capacitors used for dc bus decoupling. In this paper, a primary-side peak current control method applied for driving a two-stage multichannel LED driver is proposed. The LED driver consists of an ac&#x2013;dc boost power factor correction stage and an isolated dc&#x2013;dc nonresonant stage. A long-lifetime and small film capacitor is used for implementing the intermediate dc bus. The proposed method, which controls the peak value of the primary-side current of the transformers, is applied to the dc&#x2013;dc stage to ensure constant dc current output of LEDs in spite of the widely varying dc bus voltage due to low bus capacitance. The proposed method compensates the effect of the large dc bus voltage ripple by varying the switching frequency of the primary-side switches. Detailed design procedure, theoretical analysis, and experimental results of the LED driver operating at 180 W with the proposed method are provided. The LED driver with the proposed control method is proved to have high overall efficiency.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The objective of this paper is to develop a method for assisting users to push power-assisted wheelchairs (PAWs) in such a way that the electrical energy consumption over a predefined distance-to-go is optimal, while at the same time bringing users to a desired fatigue level. This assistive task is formulated as an optimal control problem and solved by Feng et al. using the model-free approach gradient of partially observable Markov decision processes. To increase the data efficiency of the model-free framework, we here propose to use policy learning by weighting exploration with the returns (PoWER) with 25 control parameters. Moreover, we provide a new near-optimality analysis of the finite-horizon fuzzy Q-iteration, which derives a model-based baseline solution to verify numerically the near-optimality of the presented model-free approaches. Simulation results show that the PoWER algorithm with the new parameterization converges to a near-optimal solution within 200 trials and possesses the adaptability to cope with changes of the human fatigue dynamics. Finally, 24 experimental trials are carried out on the PAW system, with fatigue feedback provided by the user via a joystick. The performance tends to increase gradually after learning. The results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness and the feasibility of PoWER in our application.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent years have witnessed the promising future of hashing in the industrial applications for fast similarity retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised hashing method for large-scale cross-media search, termed self-supervised deep multimodal hashing (SSDMH), which learns unified hash codes as well as deep hash functions for different modalities in a self-supervised manner. With the proposed regularized binary latent model, unified binary codes can be solved directly without relaxation strategy while retaining the neighborhood structures by the graph regularization term. Moreover, we propose a new discrete optimization solution, termed as binary gradient descent, which aims at improving the optimization efficiency toward real-time operation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets demonstrate the superiority of SSDMH over state-of-the-art cross-media hashing approaches.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With a large number of video surveillance systems installed for the requirement from industrial security, the task of object tracking, which aims to locate objects of interest in videos, is very important. Although numerous tracking algorithms for RGB videos have been developed in the decade, the tracking performance and robustness of these systems may be degraded dramatically when the information from RGB video is unreliable (e.g., poor illumination conditions or very low resolution). To address this issue, this paper presents a new tracking system, which aims to combine the information from RGB and infrared modalities for object tracking. The proposed tracking systems is based on our proposed machine learning model. Particularly, the learning model can alleviate the modality discrepancy issue under the proposed modality consistency constraint from both representation patterns and discriminability, and generate discriminative feature templates for collaborative representations and discrimination in heterogeneous modalities. Experiments on a variety of challenging RGB-infrared videos demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The ability to recognize actions throughout a video is essential for surveillance, self-driving, and many other applications. Although many researchers have investigated deep neural networks to get a better result in video action recognition, these networks usually require a large number of well-labeled data to train. In this paper, we introduce a dense dilated network to collect action information from snippet-level to global-level. The dilated dense network is composed of the blocks with densely connected dilated convolutions layers. Our proposed framework is capable of fusing outputs from each layer to learn high-level representations, and these representations are robust even with only a few training snippets. We study different spatial and temporal modality fusing configurations and introduce a novel temporal guided fusion upon the dense dilated network which can further boost the performance. We conduct extensive experiments on two popular video action datasets: UCF101 and HMDB51. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
