<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Existing techniques to ensure functional correctness and hardware trust
during pre-silicon verification face severe limitations. In this work, we
systematically leverage two key ideas: 1) Symbolic QED, a recent bug detection
and localization technique using Bounded Model Checking (BMC); and 2) Symbolic
starting states, to present a method that: i) Effectively detects both
"difficult" logic bugs and Hardware Trojans, even with long activation
sequences where traditional BMC techniques fail; and ii) Does not need skilled
manual guidance for writing testbenches, writing design-specific assertions, or
debugging spurious counter-examples. Using open-source RISC-V cores, we
demonstrate the following: 1. Quick (&lt;5 minutes for an in-order scalar core and
&lt;2.5 hours for an out-of-order superscalar core) detection of 100% of hundreds
of logic bug and hardware Trojan scenarios from commercial chips and research
literature, and 97.9% of "extremal" bugs (randomly-generated bugs requiring
~100,000 activation instructions taken from random test programs). 2. Quick (~1
minute) detection of several previously unknown bugs in open-source RISC-V
designs.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The security of computers is at risk because of information leaking through
physical outputs such as power, temperature, or electromagnetic (EM) emissions.
Attackers can use advanced signal measurement and analysis to recover sensitive
data from these sidechannels. To address this problem, this paper presents
Maya, a simple and effective solution against power side-channels. The idea is
to re-shape the power dissipated by an application in an
application-transparent manner using control theory techniques - preventing
attackers from learning any information. With control theory, a controller can
reliably keep power close to a desired target value even when runtime
conditions change unpredictably. Then, by changing these targets intelligently,
power can be made to appear in any desired form, appearing to carry activity
information which, in reality, is unrelated to the application. Maya can be
implemented in privileged software or in simple hardware. In this paper, we
implement Maya on two multiprocessor machines using Operating System (OS)
threads, and show its effectiveness and ease of deployment.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In many communication channels, secrecy constraints usually incur a penalty in capacity, as well as generalized degrees-of-freedom (GDoF). In this paper, we show an interesting observation that adding a helper can totally remove the penalty in sum GDoF for a two-user symmetric Gaussian interference channel. For the interference channel where each transmitter sends a message to an intended receiver without secrecy constraints, the sum GDoF is a well-known &#x201c;W&#x201d; curve, characterized by Etkin-Tse-Wang in 2008. If the secrecy constraints are imposed on this interference channel, where the message of each transmitter must be secure from the unintended receiver (eavesdropper), then a GDoF penalty is incurred and the secure sum GDoF is reduced to a modified &#x201c;W&#x201d; curve, derived by Chen recently. In this paper, we show that, by adding a helper into this interference channel with secrecy constraints, the secure sum GDoF turns out to be a &#x201c;W&#x201d; curve, which is the same as the sum GDoF of the setting without secrecy constraints. The proposed scheme is based on the cooperative jamming and a careful signal design such that the jamming signal of the helper is aligned at a specific direction and power level with the information signals of the transmitters, which allows us to totally remove the penalty in GDoF due to the secrecy constraints. Furthermore, the estimation approaches of noise removal and signal separation due to the rational independence are used in the secure rate analysis.

<p>The electroencephalography (EEG) method has recently attracted increasing attention in the study of brain activity-based biometric systems because of its simplicity, portability, noninvasiveness, and relatively low cost. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG, most of the existing EEG-based biometric systems require a long duration of signals to achieve high accuracy in individual identification. Besides, the feasibility and stability of these systems have not yet been conclusively reported, since most studies did not perform longitudinal evaluation. In this paper, we proposed a novel EEG-based individual identification method using code-modulated visualevoked potentials (c-VEPs). Specifically, this paper quantitatively compared eight code-modulated stimulation patterns, including six 63-bit (1.05 s at 60-Hz refresh rate) m-sequences (M1-M6) and two spatially combined sequence groups (M&#x00d7;4: M1-M4 and M&#x00d7; 6: M1-M6) in recording the c-VEPs from a group of 25 subjects for individual identification. To further evaluate the influence of inter-session variability, we recorded two data sessions for each individual on different days to measure intra-session and cross-session identification performance. State-of-the-art VEP detection algorithms in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) were employed to construct a template-matching-based identification framework. For intra-session identification, we achieved a 100% correct recognition rate (CRR) using 5.25-s EEG data (average of five trials for M5). For cross-session identification, 99.43% CRR was attained using 10.5-s EEG signals (average of ten trials for M5). These results suggest that the proposed c-VEP based individual identification method is promising for real-world applications.

<p>Traditional single-factor authentication possesses several critical security
vulnerabilities due to single-point failure feature. Multi-factor
authentication (MFA), intends to enhance security by providing additional
verification steps. However, in practical deployment, users often experience
dissatisfaction while using MFA, which leads to non-adoption. In order to
understand the current design and usability issues with MFA, we analyze
aggregated user generated comments (N = 12,500) about application-based MFA
tools from major distributors, such as, Amazon, Google Play, Apple App Store,
and others. While some users acknowledge the security benefits of MFA, majority
of them still faced problems with initial configuration, system design
understanding, limited device compatibility, and risk trade-offs leading to
non-adoption of MFA. Based on these results, we provide actionable
recommendations in technological design, initial training, and risk
communication to improve the adoption and user experience of MFA.

<p>The importance of training robust neural network grows as 3D data is
increasingly utilized in deep learning for vision tasks, like autonomous
driving. We examine this problem from the perspective of the attacker, which is
necessary in understanding how neural networks can be exploited, and thus
defended. More specifically, we propose adversarial attacks based on solving
different optimization problems, like minimizing the perceptibility of our
generated adversarial examples, or maintaining a uniform density distribution
of points across the adversarial object surfaces. Our four proposed algorithms
for attacking 3D point cloud classification are all highly successful on
existing neural networks, and we find that some of them are even effective

<p>Recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown

challenges to visual forensics and model attribution. We present the first
study of learning GAN fingerprints towards image attribution and using them to
classify an image as real or GAN-generated. For GAN-generated images, we
further identify their sources. Our experiments show that (1) GANs carry
distinct model fingerprints and leave stable fingerprints in their generated
images, which support image attribution; (2) even minor differences in GAN
training can result in different fingerprints, which enables fine-grained model
authentication; (3) fingerprints persist across different image frequencies and
patches and are not biased by GAN artifacts; (4) fingerprint finetuning is
effective in immunizing against five types of adversarial image perturbations;
and (5) comparisons also show our learned fingerprints consistently outperform
several baselines in a variety of setups.

<p>Family health history (FHH) is the most useful means of assessing risk for common chronic diseases. The odds ratio for risk of developing disease with a positive FHH is frequently greater than 2, and actions can be taken to mitigate risk by adhering to screening guidelines, genetic counselling, genetic risk testing, and other screening methods. Challenges to the routine acquisition of FHH include constraints on provider time to collect data and the difficulty in accessing risk calculators. Disease-specific and broader risk assessment software platforms have been developed, many with clinical decision support and informatics interoperability, but few access patient information directly.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A key problem in co-saliency detection is how to effectively model the interactive relationship of a whole image group and the individual perspective of each image in a united data-driven manner. In this paper, we propose a group-wise deep co-saliency detection approach to address the co-saliency object discovery problem based on the fully convolutional network (FCN). The proposed approach captures the group-wise interaction information for group images by learning a semantics-aware image representation based on a convolutional neural network, which adaptively learns the group-wise features for co-saliency detection. Furthermore, the proposed approach discovers the collaborative and interactive relationships between group-wise feature representation and single-image individual feature representation and models this in a collaborative learning framework. Then, we set up a unified deep learning scheme to jointly optimize the process of group-wise feature representation learning and collaborative learning, leading to more reliable and robust co-saliency detection results. Finally, we present a graph Laplacian regularized nonlinear regression model for saliency refinement. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Developing an automatic age estimation method toward human faces continues to possess an important role in computer vision and pattern recognition. Many studies regarding facial age estimation mainly focus on two aspects: facial aging feature extraction and classification/regression model learning. To set our work apart from existing age estimation approaches, we consider a different aspect&#x2014;system structuring, which is under a constrained condition: given a fixed feature type and a fixed learning method, how to design a framework to improve the age estimation performance based on the constraint? We propose a four-stage fusion framework for facial age estimation. This framework starts from gender recognition, then goes to the second phase, gender-specific age grouping, followed by the third stage, age estimation within age groups, and finally ends at the fusion stage. In the experiment, three well-known benchmark datasets, MORPH-II, FG-NET, and CLAP2016, are adopted to validate the procedure. The experimental results show that the performance can be significantly improved by using our proposed framework and this framework also outperforms several state-of-the-art age estimation methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we present a novel approach to find informative and anomalous samples in videos exploiting the concept of typicality from information theory. In most video analysis tasks, selection of the most informative samples from a huge pool of training data in order to learn a good recognition model is an important problem. Furthermore, it is also useful to reduce the annotation cost, as it is time-consuming to annotate unlabeled samples. Typicality is a simple and powerful technique, which can be applied to compress the training data to learn a good classification model. In a continuous video clip, an activity shares a strong correlation with its previous activities. We assume that the activity samples that appear in a video form a Markov chain. We explicitly show how typicality can be utilized in this scenario. We compute an atypical score for a sample using typicality and the Markovian property, which can be applied to two challenging vision problems: 1) sample selection for learning activity recognition models and 2) anomaly detection. In the first case, our approach leads to a significant reduction in manual labeling cost while achieving similar or better recognition performance compared with a model trained with the entire training set. For the latter case, the atypical score has been exploited in identifying anomalous activities in videos, where our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework over other recent strategies.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Participatory sensing is a crowdsourcing-based framework, where the platform executes the sensing requests with the help of many common peoples&#x2019; handheld devices (typically smartphones). In this paper, we mainly address the online sensing request admission and smartphone selection problem to maximize the profit of the platform, taking into account the queue backlog, and the location of sensing requests and smartphones. First, we formulate this problem as a discrete time model and design a location aware online admission and selection control algorithm (LAAS) based on the Lyapunov optimization technique. The LAAS algorithm only depends on the currently available information and makes all the control decisions independently and simultaneously. Next, we utilize the recent advancement of the accurate prediction of smartphones&#x2019; mobility and sensing request arrival information in the next few time slots and develop a predictive location aware admission and selection control algorithm (PLAAS). We further design a greedy predictive location aware admission and selection control algorithm (GPLAAS) to achieve the online implementation of PLAAS approximately and iteratively. Theoretical analysis shows that under any control parameter V &gt; 0, both LAAS and PLAAS algorithm can achieve O(1&#x002f;V)-optimal average profit, while the sensing request backlog is bounded by O(V). Extensive numerical results based on both synthetic and real trace show that LAAS outperforms the Greedy algorithm and Random algorithm and GPLAAS improves the profit-backlog tradeoff over LAAS.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents an energy management method to optimally control the energy supply and the temperature settings of distributed heating and ventilation systems for residential buildings. The control model attempts to schedule the supply and demand simultaneously with the purpose of minimizing the total costs. Moreover, the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) model is introduced into the consumers&#x2019; cost functions and the quadratic fitting method is applied to simplify the PPD model. An energy management algorithm is developed to seek the optimal temperature settings, the energy supply, and the price. Furthermore, due to the ubiquity of price oscillations in electricity markets, we analyze and examine the effects of price oscillations on the performance of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the theoretical analysis and simulation results both demonstrate that the proposed energy management algorithm with price oscillations can converge to a region around the optimal solution.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The deployment of smart hybrid heat pumps (SHHPs) can introduce considerable benefits to electricity systems via smart switching between electricity and gas while minimizing the total heating cost for each individual customer. In particular, the fully optimized control technology can provide flexible heat that redistributes the heat demand across time for improving the utilization of low-carbon generation and enhancing the overall energy efficiency of the heating system. To this end, an accurate quantification of the preheating is of great importance to characterize the flexible heat. This paper proposes a novel data-driven preheating quantification method to estimate the capability of the heat pump demand shifting and isolate the effect of interventions. Varieties of fine-grained data from a real-world trial are exploited to estimate the baseline heat demand using Bayesian deep learning while jointly considering epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. A comprehensive range of case studies are carried out to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed quantification method, and then, the estimated demand shift is used as an input into the whole-system model to investigate the system implications and quantify the range of benefits of rolling out the SHHPs developed by PassivSystems to the future GB electricity systems.

<p>Obtaining an appropriate model is very crucial to develop an efficient energy management system for the smart home, including photovoltaic (PV) array, plug-in electric vehicle (PEV), home loads, and heat pump (HP). Stochastic modeling methods of smart homes explain random parameters and uncertainties of the aforementioned components. In this paper, a concise yet comprehensive analysis and comparison are presented for these techniques. First, modeling methods are implemented to find appropriate and precise forecasting models for PV, PEV, HP, and home load demand. Then, the accuracy of each model is validated by the real measured data. Finally, the pros and cons of each method are discussed and reviewed. The obtained results show the conditions under which the methods can provide a reliable and accurate description of smart home dynamics.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Clothing and carrying status variations are the two key factors that affect the performance of gait recognition because people usually wear various clothes and carry all kinds of objects, while walking in their daily life. These covariates substantially affect the intensities within conventional gait representations such as gait energy images. Hence, to properly compare a pair of input gait features, an appropriate metric for joint intensity is needed in addition to the conventional spatial metric. We therefore propose a unified joint intensity transformer network for gait recognition that is robust against various clothing and carrying statuses. Specifically, the joint intensity transformer network is a unified deep learning-based architecture containing three parts: a joint intensity metric estimation net, a joint intensity transformer, and a discrimination network. First, the joint intensity metric estimation net uses a well-designed encoder-decoder network to estimate a sample-dependent joint intensity metric for a pair of input gait energy images. Subsequently, a joint intensity transformer module outputs the spatial dissimilarity of two gait energy images using the metric learned by the joint intensity metric estimation net. Third, the discrimination network is a generic convolution neural network for gait recognition. In addition, the joint intensity transformer network is designed with different loss functions depending on the gait recognition task (i.e., a contrastive loss function for the verification task and a triplet loss function for the identification task). The experiments on the world&#x2019;s largest datasets containing various clothing and carrying statuses demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>At present, the fusion of different unimodal biometrics has attracted increasing attention from researchers, who are dedicated to the practical application of biometrics. In this paper, we explored a multi-biometric algorithm that integrates palmprints and dorsal hand veins (DHV). Palmprint recognition has a rather high accuracy and reliability, and the most significant advantage of DHV recognition is the biopsy (Liveness detection). In order to combine the advantages of both and implement the fusion method, deep learning and graph matching were, respectively, introduced to identify palmprint and DHV. Upon using the deep hashing network (DHN), biometric images can be encoded as 128-bit codes. Then, the Hamming distances were used to represent the similarity of two codes. Biometric graph matching (BGM) can obtain three discriminative features for classification. In order to improve the accuracy of open-set recognition, in multi-modal fusion, the score-level fusion of DHN and BGM was performed and authentication was provided by support vector machine (SVM). Furthermore, based on DHN, all four levels of fusion strategies were used for multi-modal recognition of palmprint and DHV. Evaluation experiments and comprehensive comparisons were conducted on various commonly used datasets, and the promising results were obtained in this case where the equal error rates (EERs) of both palmprint recognition and multi-biometrics equal 0, demonstrating the great superiority of DHN in biometric verification.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In cyberspace, evolutionary strategies are commonly used by both attackers and defenders. For example, an attacker&#x2019;s strategy often changes over the course of time, as new vulnerabilities are discovered and/or mitigated. Similarly, a defender&#x2019;s strategy changes over time. These changes may or may not be in direct response to a change in the opponent&#x2019;s strategy. In any case, it is important to have a set of quantitative metrics to characterize and understand the effectiveness of attackers&#x2019; and defenders&#x2019; evolutionary strategies, which reflect their cyber agility. Despite its clear importance, few systematic metrics have been developed to quantify the cyber agility of attackers and defenders. In this paper, we propose the first metric framework for measuring cyber agility in terms of the effectiveness of the dynamic evolution of cyber attacks and defenses. The proposed framework is generic and applicable to transform any relevant, quantitative, and/or conventional static security metrics (e.g., false positives and false negatives) into dynamic metrics to capture dynamics of system behaviors. In order to validate the usefulness of the proposed framework, we conduct case studies on measuring the evolution of cyber attacks and defenses using two real-world datasets. We discuss the limitations of the current work and identify future research directions.

The PWM carrier and the main current sampling frequency are both set to 1&#x00a0;kHz, resulting in a 500&#x00a0;Hz average switching frequency per device, which is very suitable for large drive applications. The explicit predictive control is introduced to optimize the available bandwidth provided by such a low sampling frequency, maximizing the dynamic performance.

<p>AC&#x2013;DC light-emitting diode (LED) drivers suffer from short lifetime because of the low-lifetime electrolytic capacitors used for dc bus decoupling. In this paper, a primary-side peak current control method applied for driving a two-stage multichannel LED driver is proposed. The LED driver consists of an ac&#x2013;dc boost power factor correction stage and an isolated dc&#x2013;dc nonresonant stage. A long-lifetime and small film capacitor is used for implementing the intermediate dc bus. The proposed method, which controls the peak value of the primary-side current of the transformers, is applied to the dc&#x2013;dc stage to ensure constant dc current output of LEDs in spite of the widely varying dc bus voltage due to low bus capacitance. The proposed method compensates the effect of the large dc bus voltage ripple by varying the switching frequency of the primary-side switches. Detailed design procedure, theoretical analysis, and experimental results of the LED driver operating at 180 W with the proposed method are provided. The LED driver with the proposed control method is proved to have high overall efficiency.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The objective of this paper is to develop a method for assisting users to push power-assisted wheelchairs (PAWs) in such a way that the electrical energy consumption over a predefined distance-to-go is optimal, while at the same time bringing users to a desired fatigue level. This assistive task is formulated as an optimal control problem and solved by Feng et al. using the model-free approach gradient of partially observable Markov decision processes. To increase the data efficiency of the model-free framework, we here propose to use policy learning by weighting exploration with the returns (PoWER) with 25 control parameters. Moreover, we provide a new near-optimality analysis of the finite-horizon fuzzy Q-iteration, which derives a model-based baseline solution to verify numerically the near-optimality of the presented model-free approaches. Simulation results show that the PoWER algorithm with the new parameterization converges to a near-optimal solution within 200 trials and possesses the adaptability to cope with changes of the human fatigue dynamics. Finally, 24 experimental trials are carried out on the PAW system, with fatigue feedback provided by the user via a joystick. The performance tends to increase gradually after learning. The results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness and the feasibility of PoWER in our application.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent years have witnessed the promising future of hashing in the industrial applications for fast similarity retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised hashing method for large-scale cross-media search, termed self-supervised deep multimodal hashing (SSDMH), which learns unified hash codes as well as deep hash functions for different modalities in a self-supervised manner. With the proposed regularized binary latent model, unified binary codes can be solved directly without relaxation strategy while retaining the neighborhood structures by the graph regularization term. Moreover, we propose a new discrete optimization solution, termed as binary gradient descent, which aims at improving the optimization efficiency toward real-time operation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets demonstrate the superiority of SSDMH over state-of-the-art cross-media hashing approaches.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Video saliency detection aims to continuously discover the motion-related salient objects from the video sequences. Since it needs to consider the spatial and temporal constraints jointly, video saliency detection is more challenging than image saliency detection. In this paper, we propose a new method to detect the salient objects in video based on sparse reconstruction and propagation. With the assistance of novel static and motion priors, a single-frame saliency model is first designed to represent the spatial saliency in each individual frame via the sparsity-based reconstruction. Then, through a progressive sparsity-based propagation, the sequential correspondence in the temporal space is captured to produce the inter-frame saliency map. Finally, these two maps are incorporated into a global optimization model to achieve spatio-temporal smoothness and global consistency of the salient object in the whole video. The experiments on three large-scale video saliency datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The ability to recognize actions throughout a video is essential for surveillance, self-driving, and many other applications. Although many researchers have investigated deep neural networks to get a better result in video action recognition, these networks usually require a large number of well-labeled data to train. In this paper, we introduce a dense dilated network to collect action information from snippet-level to global-level. The dilated dense network is composed of the blocks with densely connected dilated convolutions layers. Our proposed framework is capable of fusing outputs from each layer to learn high-level representations, and these representations are robust even with only a few training snippets. We study different spatial and temporal modality fusing configurations and introduce a novel temporal guided fusion upon the dense dilated network which can further boost the performance. We conduct extensive experiments on two popular video action datasets: UCF101 and HMDB51. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
