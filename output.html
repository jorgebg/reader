When a single spin flips in a one-dimensional system, it can cause neighbouring spins to flip and thus propagate the flip along the chain. This type of magnetic excitation can be described as an elementary quasiparticle known as a magnon. In the 1930s, Hans Bethe predicted that multiple spins could flip and that the multi-spin flip could propagate, giving rise to complex multi-magnon states that look like strings. Using terahertz spectroscopy, Zhe Wang and colleagues measure such 'Bethe strings' directly in a one-dimensional Heisenberg&#8211;Ising antiferromagnet, and show that they dominate the quantum spin dynamics when the system is close to a quantum phase transition.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nature/rss/current/~4/RULo5uuvjnA" width="1" />

They can be ejective, causing coronal mass ejections, or confined. What actually confines the flares has been debated, with two basic alternatives suggested: topological complexity in the magnetic structure above the Sun's surface, or an unstable, twisted magnetic flux rope. Tahar Amari and colleagues followed the growth of a large confined eruption on the Sun and predict its evolution using a two-stage modelling approach. They find that a multilayer magnetic 'cage' containing a twisted flux rope controls the evolution of the eruption, which can be ejective depending on the strength of the cage. The cage also controls the amount of energy that is released.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nature/rss/current/~4/lZVX9eZWpW4" width="1" />

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The emergence of malicious apps poses a serious threat to the Android platform. Most types of mobile malware rely on network interface to coordinate operations, steal users&#x2019; private information, and launch attack activities. In this paper, we propose an effective and automatic malware detection method using the text semantics of network traffic. In particular, we consider each HTTP flow generated by mobile apps as a text document, which can be processed by natural language processing to extract text-level features. Then, we use the text semantic features of network traffic to develop an effective malware detection model. In an evaluation using 31 706 benign flows and 5258 malicious flows, our method outperforms the existing approaches, and gets an accuracy of 99.15&#x0025;. We also conduct experiments to verify that the method is effective in detecting newly discovered malware, and requires only a few samples to achieve a good detection result. When the detection model is applied to the real environment to detect unknown applications in the wild, the experimental results show that our method performs significantly better than other popular anti-virus scanners with a detection rate of 54.81&#x0025;. Our method also reveals certain malware types that can avoid the detection of anti-virus scanners. In addition, we design a detection system on encrypted traffic for bring-your-own-device enterprise network, home network, and 3G/4G mobile network. The detection model is integrated into the system to discover suspicious network behaviors.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Brain signals have recently attracted the attention of the scientific community as potential biometric identifiers. In more detail, there is a growing interest in evaluating the feasibility of using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings to perform automatic people recognition. In this scenario, the study of the longitudinal behavior of EEG signals, i.e., their permanence across time, is of paramount importance. This paper is the first extensive attempt, in terms of employed elicitation protocols, number of involved subjects, number of acquisition sessions, and covered time span, to evaluate the influence of aging effects on the discriminative capabilities of EEG signals over long-term periods. Specifically, we here report and discuss the results obtained from experimental tests conducted on a database comprising 45 subjects, whose EEG signals have been collected during five to six distinct sessions spanning a total period of three years, using four different elicitation protocols. The longitudinal behavior of EEG discriminative traits is evaluated by means of a statistical-and performance-related analysis, using different EEG features and hidden Markov models as classifiers. A characterization of each considered EEG channel in terms of uniqueness and permanence properties is also performed, with the purpose of ranking their relevance for biometric purposes, thus giving hints to contain their number in practical applications. Moreover, we design some possible countermeasures to mitigate aging effects on recognition performance and evaluate their effectiveness, thus paving the road for the future deployment of real-life cognitive recognition systems relying on brain-based biometric traits.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The need for improved critical infrastructure and key resource security is unquestioned and there has been minimal emphasis on level-0 (PHY process) improvements. Wired signal distinct native attribute finger-printing is investigated here as a non-intrusive PHY-based security augmentation to support an envisioned layered security strategy. Results are based on experimental response collections from highway addressable remote transducer differential pressure transmitter devices from three manufacturers (Yokogawa, Honeywell, and Endress&#x002b;Hauser) in an automated process control system. Device discrimination is assessed using time domain (TD) and slope-based FSK (SB-FSK) fingerprints input to multiple discriminant analysis, maximum likelihood and random forest (RndF) classifiers. For 12 different classes (two devices per manufacturer at two distinct set points), both classifiers performed reliably and achieved an arbitrary performance benchmark of average cross-class percent correct of &#x0025; $C$  &#x003e; 90&#x0025;. The least challenging cross-manufacturer results included near-perfect &#x0025; $Capprox 100$ &#x0025;, while the more challenging like-model (serial number) discrimination results included 90&#x0025; &#x003c; &#x0025; $C$  &#x003c; 100&#x0025;, with TD fingerprinting marginally outperforming SB-FSK fingerprinting; SB-FSK benefits from having less stringent response alignment and registration requirements. The RndF classifier was most beneficial and enabled reliable selection of dimensionally reduced fingerprint subsets that minimize data storage and computational requirements. The RndF selected -
eature sets contained 15&#x0025; of the full-dimensional feature sets and only suffered a worst case &#x0025; $C_{Delta}$  &#x003d; 3&#x0025; to &#x0025; $C_{Delta}$  &#x003d; 4&#x0025; performance degradation.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The standard local binary pattern (LBP) operator shows its versatility in performing image classification-related tasks, including texture analysis, object recognition, and steganalysis. However, a conventional well-designed scheme utilizing LBP operator and histogram-based features does not have obvious advantage when compared with the well-known steganalytic scheme spatial rich model (SRM). In this paper, we propose an adapted LBP version, called threshold LBP (TLBP), to reveal the artifacts caused by data embedding. In the proposed steganalytic scheme, the TLBP operation is performed on residual images which are obtained by using a set of high-order derivative filters to capture intricate relationships among pixels. After performing TLBP operation, second order co-occurrence matrix features are formed and then processed with aggregation and non-linear mapping for boosting feature effectiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed TLBP features prevail over SRM features under various steganographic conditions.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Similar to conventional compression with the original, unencrypted image as the input, the recently emerged compression on encrypted images generally exploits statistical correlation of natural images to improve compression efficiency. Most of these compression schemes in the literature leverage statistical correlation at the content-owner or service-provider side, which would either increase the computational burden on the content-owner or disclose statistical distributions to the service-provider and thus probably hinder their practical applications. Through analysis on properties of the compression system for encrypted data, we believe that it is more preferable to exploit statistical correlation of natural images at the receiver side with both encryption key and sufficient computational capability, which in turn would improve compression efficiency while achieving low computational complexity and sufficient security for the content owner and the service provider. In light of this, we use the Markov random field (MRF) to characterize binary images in the spatial domain and represent it with a factor graph. The constructed MRF representation of the binary image in the factor graph is then integrated seamlessly with the factor graph for low-density parity check (LDPC)-based decompression, yielding a joint factor graph for binary image reconstruction. By deriving message update equations for the joint factor graph, we develop a new lossless compression scheme for encrypted binary images, which involves stream-cipher-based encryption, LDPC-based compression, and factor-graph-based image reconstruction. Preferable parameters for the proposed scheme are first determined numerically on a specific binary image and then applied to other binary images. Extensive simulations show that significant improvements in terms of compression bit rate over the state of the art are achieved, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to the volatility of the cost and sustainability concerns associated with the rare-earth permanent magnets, alternative product designs using less or no rare-earth contents have, recently, gained popularity. Another method to address this need is to apply a magnet recycling process, such as the novel hydrogen processing of magnetic scrap (HPMS) which can be applied to the end-of-life products such as hard drive disks. Despite the growing research on the background science of different recycling techniques, a practical make, use and evaluation of recycled magnets in a real-life application, is rarely attended. To address this gap, in this paper and for the first time, the viability of the HPMS recycled magnets for use in a permanent magnet traction motor is investigated. On this basis, a detailed description and testing of the recycling process and the magnet production for a customized traction motor design is provided. Furthermore, the behavior of the motor using the final magnet product is analyzed using simulations and prototype testing. Based on the results, the proposed recycled magnets satisfy the overall requirements, while demonstrating similar or better electromagnetic performance compared to the alternative low-cost ferrite magnets.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The hybrid modulation strategy using both low-frequency square-wave modulation and high-frequency pulse-width modulation can extend the stable operating region of a cascaded H-bridge converter. However, it does not control accurately dc voltages of converter but balances them by charging or discharging dc capacitors based on the state of system, which could aggravate fluctuation of dc voltages. If cascaded H-bridge converter is used in photovoltaic field, the aggravated fluctuation on dc capacitor voltages will result in further losses in energy harvesting of solar cells. To address this issue, a modified hybrid modulation strategy is presented in this paper. When dc-bus measured voltages are close to their reference voltages, these H-bridges operate in a zero mode. Adding appropriate zero state can prevent grid current charging or discharging the dc capacitors whose voltages have already reached their control goals. Therefore, the proposed technique is capable of suppressing dc voltage fluctuation, and, thus, improving the output power of solar cells. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This study proposes a novel prosthetic hand that can artificially replace human sensation using haptic transplant technology. Conventional motorized prostheses are unable to precisely control the grasping force of the hand due to the lack of force sensation. In this paper, a haptic prosthetic hand is developed that allows for intuitive operation and precise force adjustment. These functions are realized by artificially transplanting the tactile sensation of a healthy part of the user's body to the amputated part of their body. The haptic transplant technology transmits the force sensation of the prosthesis to the master interface attached to the amputee's healthy part of body using bilateral control without a force sensor. Furthermore, variable compliance control is proposed for flexible adaptation to the shape of the object being grasped. The effectiveness of the proposed system was experimentally verified by comparing the controllability of the proposed system with that of a myoelectric prosthesis. In summary, an artificial replacement for human sensation was developed, and the intuitive operability and flexibility of the proposed system were confirmed.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Conventional permanent magnet (PM) machine open-phase fault detection relies on the estimation of current harmonics using available phase current sensors. Because the magnitudes of current harmonic are proportional to the machine load condition, it is still a challenge to detect a phase fault at light load when fault-induced current harmonics are too small to estimate. This paper investigates the phase fault detection specifically for the conditions under low fault harmonic magnitudes. Both fault-induced harmonics in dq currents and neutral point (NP) voltage are analyzed to find a suited signal for the fault detection. By adding a voltage sensor to measure the NP voltage in a PM machine, a better fault detection performance is achieved because the fault harmonic in NP voltage results in the reduced effect on torque loads and sensor measurement errors. A 50-W PM machine is tested to verify the phase fault detection performance under low fault harmonic magnitudes. This paper includes the experimental evaluation on the detection limitation in terms of load capability using current and voltage fault signals.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>As for ripple-current mode control, it cannot achieve average current tracking, resulting in poor current accuracy and even current waveform distortion. Meanwhile, fast-scale instability may occur in some operating conditions. To solve these problems effectively, a current-ripple compensation (CRC) control technique is proposed in this paper. The error between the average of the controlled current and the reference current is compensated by certain compensation signal, achieving average current tracking while suppressing fast-scale instability. On this basis, the compensator in the outer-voltage loop is further simplified to a proportional part by introducing a rebuilt average reference current. The idea and design procedure of the proposed CRC control technique are discussed in detail. Accordingly, two available implementation schemes for the proposed CRC are presented, including slope compensated and parabolic compensated schemes. Finally, two application cases, respectively, to dc&#x2013;dc Buck converter and Boost PFC converter, are presented to verify the proposed CRC control technique.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Privacy-preserving data aggregation has been extensively studied in smart grid. However, almost all existing schemes aggregate the total electricity consumption data of the whole user set, which sometimes cannot meet the fine-grained demands from control center in smart grid. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving multisubset data aggregation scheme, named PPMA, in smart grid. PPMA can aggregate users&#x2019; electricity consumption data of different ranges, while guaranteeing the privacy of individual users. Detailed security analysis shows that PPMA can protect individual user&#x0027;s electricity consumption privacy against a strong adversary. In addition, extensive experiments results demonstrate that PPMA has less computation overhead and no more extra communication and storage costs.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a new hierarchical decentralized optimization architecture is proposed to solve the economic dispatch problem for a large-scale power system. Conventionally, such a problem is solved in a centralized way, which is usually inflexible and costly in computation. In contrast to centralized algorithms, in this paper we decompose the centralized problem into local problems. Each local generator only solves its own problem iteratively, based on its own cost function and generation constraint. An extra coordinator agent is employed to coordinate all the local generator agents. Besides, it also takes responsibility to handle the global demand supply constraint based on a newly proposed concept named virtual agent. In this way, different from existing distributed algorithms, the global demand supply constraint and local generation constraints are handled separately, which would greatly reduce the computational complexity. In addition, as only local individual estimate is exchanged between the local agent and the coordinator agent, the communication burden is reduced and the information privacy is also protected. It is theoretically shown that under proposed hierarchical decentralized optimization architecture, each local generator agent can obtain the optimal solution in a decentralized fashion. Several case studies implemented on the IEEE 30-bus and the IEEE 118-bus are discussed and tested to validate the proposed method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Since operating conditions of power systems always change, the input and output signals of wide-area damping controller (WADC), which are selected at an operating point, may not be able to guarantee the damping effect at other operating points. This paper focuses on a new adaptive signal selection for WADC against several operating conditions, such as various load demands, control signal failure, line and generator outages, and effect of communication latency. The joint controllability and observability is used to determine the best input and output pairs of WADC at any operating points. Small-signal and transient stabilities study in the IEEE 50-machine system including renewable sources, i.e., wind and solar photovoltaic generators are conducted to evaluate the effect of the proposed method. Study result demonstrates that the WADC with the adaptive signal selection yields superior damping effect to the WADC with the fixed signal selection over wide range operations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>When single-loop inverter-side current control is used in the LCL-type inverters, there may be more than one stable region with regard to computation delay in control path. The system is stable if computation delay is small enough, but it, named as the first stable region, may be too narrow to finish the control codes in high-frequency system. On the other hand, the second stable region is highly sensitive to the grid impedance variation and is hardly applicable in weak grids. To deal with the situation, this paper investigates the influence of the capacitor voltage feedforward on the system stability considering flexible computation delay in feedforward path. It is found that the capacitor voltage feedforward is able to suppress the resonance of the LCL filter. However, a new resonance may arise if computation delay is not carefully handled. The influence of computation delay in both forward path and feedforward path on system stability is systematically analyzed. The analytical results show that after applying feedforward control with optimized delay, the system stability is greatly improved and is not sensitive to the grid impedance variation. The simulation and experiment results verify the analytical results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the widespread adoption of Internet of Things and cloud computing in different industry sectors, an increasing number of individuals or organizations are outsourcing their Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) data in the cloud server to achieve cost saving and collaboration (e.g., data sharing). However, in this environment, preserving the privacy of data remains a key challenge and inhibiting factor to an even wider adoption of IIoT in the cloud environment. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we design a new secure channel-free certificateless searchable public key encryption with multiple keywords scheme for IIoT deployment. We then demonstrate the security of the scheme in the random oracle model against two types of adversaries, where one adversary is given the power to choose a random public key instead of any user&#x0027;s public key and another adversary is allowed to learn the system master key. In the presence of these types of adversaries, we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme and demonstrate that it achieves (computational) efficiency with low communication cost.

<p><span class="paragraphSection"><strong>To the Editor</strong> In the January 2, 2018, issue of <span style="font-style: italic;">JAMA</span>, we published a Research Letter: &#8220;Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder Among US Children and Adolescents, 2014-2016.&#8221; Using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), we found that the weighted prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was 2.41% (95% CI, 2.17%-2.65%) in 2014-2016. Sample weights are provided with the NHIS data for researchers to use during analysis to take into account unequal probabilities of selection and nonresponse. For the analysis of the 2016 data, we used the weights originally released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in June 2017. The CDC identified inaccuracies in the original sampling weights and updated them in November 2017, after acceptance of the Research Letter, but we did not become aware of this change until December 27, 2017. We reran all the analyses for our estimates using the updated weights. The conclusions were not changed, but there were some small changes in the results for the 2016 data and the pooled data from 2014-2016. For example, the overall prevalence of ASD changed from 2.41% to 2.47% (95% CI, 2.20%-2.73%), with the estimate being within the original 95% CI.
