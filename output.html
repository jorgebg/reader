<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Advances in imaging technologies, combined with inexpensive storage, have led
to an explosion in the volume of publicly available neuroimaging datasets.
Effective analyses of these images hold the potential for uncovering mechanisms
that govern functioning of the human brain, and understanding various
neurological diseases and disorders. The potential significance of these
studies notwithstanding, a growing concern relates to the protection of privacy
and confidentiality of subjects who participate in these studies. In this
paper, we present a de-anonymization attack rooted in the innate uniqueness of
the structure and function of the human brain. We show that the attack reveals
not only the identity of an individual, but also the task they are performing,
and their efficacy in performing the tasks. Our attack relies on novel matrix
analyses techniques that are used to extract discriminating features in
neuroimages. These features correspond to individual-specific signatures that
can be matched across datasets to yield highly accurate identification. We
present data preprocessing, signature extraction, and matching techniques that
are computationally inexpensive, and can scale to large datasets. We discuss
implications of the attack and challenges associated with defending against
such attacks.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent research in quantum cryptography has led to the development of schemes
that encrypt and authenticate quantum messages with computational security. The
security definitions used so far in the literature are asymptotic, game-based,
and not known to be composable. We show how to define finite, composable,
computational security for secure quantum message transmission. The new
definitions do not involve any games or oracles, they are directly operational:
a scheme is secure if it transforms an insecure channel and a shared key into
an ideal secure channel from Alice to Bob, i.e., one which only allows Eve to
block messages and learn their size, but not change them or read them. By
modifying the ideal channel to provide Eve with more or less capabilities, one
gets an array of different security notions. By design these transformations
are composable, resulting in composable security.
</p>
<p>Crucially, the new definitions are finite. Security does not rely on the
asymptotic hardness of a computational problem. Instead, one proves a finite
reduction: if an adversary can distinguish the constructed (real) channel from
the ideal one (for some fixed security parameters), then she can solve a finite
instance of some computational problem. Such a finite statement is needed to
make security claims about concrete implementations.
</p>
<p>We then prove that (slightly modified versions of) protocols proposed in the
literature satisfy these composable definitions. And finally, we study the
relations between some game-based definitions and our composable ones. In
particular, we look at notions of quantum authenticated encryption and QCCA2,
and show that they suffer from the same issues as their classical counterparts:
they exclude certain protocols which are arguably secure.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We introduce a new perspective on the evaluation of privacy, where rights of
the data subjects, privacy principles, and usability criteria are intertwined.
This new perspective is visually represented through a cube where each of its
three axes of variability captures, respectively: principles, rights, and
usability criteria. In this way, our model, called Usable Privacy Cube (or UP
Cube), brings out two perspectives on privacy: that of the data subjects and
that of the controllers/processors. In the long run, the UP Cube is meant to be
the model behind a new certification methodology capable of evaluating the
usability of privacy. Our research builds on the criteria proposed by the
EuroPriSe certification scheme by adding usability criteria to their
evaluation. We slightly reorganize the criteria of EuroPriSe to fit with the UP
Cube model, i.e., we show how the EuroPriSe can be viewed as a combination of
only principles and rights, forming the basis of the UP Cube. Usability
criteria are defined based on goals that we extract from the data protection
regulations, at the same time considering the needs, goals and characteristics
of different types of users and their context of use. The criteria are designed
to produce measurements of the level of usability with which the privacy goals
of the data protection are reached. Considering usability criteria allows for
greater business differentiation beyond GDPR compliance.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Neural networks trained with backpropagation, the standard algorithm of deep
learning which uses weight transport, are easily fooled by existing
gradient-based adversarial attacks. This class of attacks are based on certain
small perturbations of the inputs to make networks misclassify them. We show
that less biologically implausible deep neural networks trained with feedback
alignment, which do not use weight transport, can be harder to fool, providing
actual robustness. Tested on MNIST, deep neural networks trained without weight
transport (1) have an adversarial accuracy of 98% compared to 0.03% for neural
networks trained with backpropagation and (2) generate non-transferable
adversarial examples. However, this gap decreases on CIFAR-10 but still
significant particularly for small perturbation magnitude less than 1/2.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Nodes in route-restricted overlays have an immutable set of neighbors,
explicitly specified by their users. Popular examples include payment networks
such as the Lightning network as well as social overlays such as the Dark
Freenet. Routing algorithms are central to such overlays as they enable
communication between nodes that are not directly connected. Recent results
show that algorithms based on spanning trees are the most promising provably
efficient choice. However, all suggested solutions fail to address how
distributed spanning tree algorithms can deal with active denial of service
attacks by malicious nodes. In this work, we design a novel self-stabilizing
spanning tree construction algorithm that utilizes cryptographic signatures and
prove that it reduces the set of nodes affected by active attacks. Our
simulations substantiate this theoretical result with concrete values based on
real-world data sets. In particular, our results indicate that our algorithm
reduces the number of affected nodes by up to 74% compared to state-of-the-art
attack-resistant spanning tree constructions.

<p>In an era when attempts to better understand the pathophysiology and treatment of melanoma are focused on complex genomics and proteomics, it is remarkable that fundamentally simple questions about surgical excision margins remain unanswered. Often overlooked is the important fact that most patients who present with a primary cutaneous melanoma can be cured by surgery alone. The extent of that surgery must clearly be sufficient to maximise the chance of cure, while minimising patient morbidity and health-care costs associated with the reconstruction of large excision defects.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This study investigates the robust control for uncertain dynamical systems. The uncertainty is (possibly fast) time-varying but bounded. We adopt the fuzzy set theory to describe the uncertainty in the system (hence, called the fuzzy dynamical system). A class of robust controls is proposed based on tunable parameters. The controls are deterministic and are not conventional IF&#x2013;THEN fuzzy rules based (such as Mamdani type). The proposed controls are able to guarantee deterministic system performance, namely uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness. In the phase of searching for the optima from the pool of admissible control design parameters, we formulate this as a two-player cooperative game by developing two performance indexes (i.e., the cost functions), each of which is dominated by one tunable parameter (i.e., the player). By the cooperative game theory, we are able to obtain the Pareto-optimality (i.e., the optima of tunable parameters). Simulation results on an electric vehicle motion control problem are presented for demonstration.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Participatory sensing is a crowdsourcing-based framework, where the platform executes the sensing requests with the help of many common peoples&#x2019; handheld devices (typically smartphones). In this paper, we mainly address the online sensing request admission and smartphone selection problem to maximize the profit of the platform, taking into account the queue backlog, and the location of sensing requests and smartphones. First, we formulate this problem as a discrete time model and design a location aware online admission and selection control algorithm (LAAS) based on the Lyapunov optimization technique. The LAAS algorithm only depends on the currently available information and makes all the control decisions independently and simultaneously. Next, we utilize the recent advancement of the accurate prediction of smartphones&#x2019; mobility and sensing request arrival information in the next few time slots and develop a predictive location aware admission and selection control algorithm (PLAAS). We further design a greedy predictive location aware admission and selection control algorithm (GPLAAS) to achieve the online implementation of PLAAS approximately and iteratively. Theoretical analysis shows that under any control parameter V &gt; 0, both LAAS and PLAAS algorithm can achieve O(1&#x002f;V)-optimal average profit, while the sensing request backlog is bounded by O(V). Extensive numerical results based on both synthetic and real trace show that LAAS outperforms the Greedy algorithm and Random algorithm and GPLAAS improves the profit-backlog tradeoff over LAAS.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The deployment of smart hybrid heat pumps (SHHPs) can introduce considerable benefits to electricity systems via smart switching between electricity and gas while minimizing the total heating cost for each individual customer. In particular, the fully optimized control technology can provide flexible heat that redistributes the heat demand across time for improving the utilization of low-carbon generation and enhancing the overall energy efficiency of the heating system. To this end, an accurate quantification of the preheating is of great importance to characterize the flexible heat. This paper proposes a novel data-driven preheating quantification method to estimate the capability of the heat pump demand shifting and isolate the effect of interventions. Varieties of fine-grained data from a real-world trial are exploited to estimate the baseline heat demand using Bayesian deep learning while jointly considering epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. A comprehensive range of case studies are carried out to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed quantification method, and then, the estimated demand shift is used as an input into the whole-system model to investigate the system implications and quantify the range of benefits of rolling out the SHHPs developed by PassivSystems to the future GB electricity systems.

In this paper, a concise yet comprehensive analysis and comparison are presented for these techniques. First, modeling methods are implemented to find appropriate and precise forecasting models for PV, PEV, HP, and home load demand.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper investigates the residential energy management problems in the power-heat-coupling system. For better solving this issue, based on the novel concept of We-Energy (WE) for energy Internet (EI), this paper proposes a residential WE (R-WE) framework faced by the terminal users who play an important role in renewable energy consumption. Inspired by the full-duplex feature of R-WE, the power and heat supply-demand balance constraints are fulfilled in a regional unit of EI, but it may be inequality constraints for corresponding consumer, producer, or WE operation modes in only one R-WE. The R-WE framework can be classified into four operation modes, which is island mode, consumer mode, producer mode, and WE mode. On this basis, the R-WE models cooperate to achieve the objective of minimizing the operation costs, smoothing out the loads&#x2019; variations, and renewable resource fluctuations. Specifically, the R-WE framework with respect to the heat-power-coupling problem can be solved in the distributed double-consensus algorithm (DDCA), which is designed two sets of consensus algorithms by using four completely different consensus variables to calculate the power and heat multipliers, evaluate the power and heat generations and, thereby, further obtain the power mismatches of electricity and heat. Also, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimal conditions of the proposed DDCA is further proved. Meanwhile, a novel projection operation method for combined heat and power devices is designed to take the infeasible solutions mapped into the feasible region. Finally, the simulation results in different cases further demonstrate that the proposed R-WE frame can be an appropriate method to analyze the terminal consumers and harmonize multienergy producers in the process of constructing EI projects. And an R-WE framework of the campus has experimented with minority loads in island mode.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Clothing and carrying status variations are the two key factors that affect the performance of gait recognition because people usually wear various clothes and carry all kinds of objects, while walking in their daily life. These covariates substantially affect the intensities within conventional gait representations such as gait energy images. Hence, to properly compare a pair of input gait features, an appropriate metric for joint intensity is needed in addition to the conventional spatial metric. We therefore propose a unified joint intensity transformer network for gait recognition that is robust against various clothing and carrying statuses. Specifically, the joint intensity transformer network is a unified deep learning-based architecture containing three parts: a joint intensity metric estimation net, a joint intensity transformer, and a discrimination network. First, the joint intensity metric estimation net uses a well-designed encoder-decoder network to estimate a sample-dependent joint intensity metric for a pair of input gait energy images. Subsequently, a joint intensity transformer module outputs the spatial dissimilarity of two gait energy images using the metric learned by the joint intensity metric estimation net. Third, the discrimination network is a generic convolution neural network for gait recognition. In addition, the joint intensity transformer network is designed with different loss functions depending on the gait recognition task (i.e., a contrastive loss function for the verification task and a triplet loss function for the identification task). The experiments on the world&#x2019;s largest datasets containing various clothing and carrying statuses demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>At present, the fusion of different unimodal biometrics has attracted increasing attention from researchers, who are dedicated to the practical application of biometrics. In this paper, we explored a multi-biometric algorithm that integrates palmprints and dorsal hand veins (DHV). Palmprint recognition has a rather high accuracy and reliability, and the most significant advantage of DHV recognition is the biopsy (Liveness detection). In order to combine the advantages of both and implement the fusion method, deep learning and graph matching were, respectively, introduced to identify palmprint and DHV. Upon using the deep hashing network (DHN), biometric images can be encoded as 128-bit codes. Then, the Hamming distances were used to represent the similarity of two codes. Biometric graph matching (BGM) can obtain three discriminative features for classification. In order to improve the accuracy of open-set recognition, in multi-modal fusion, the score-level fusion of DHN and BGM was performed and authentication was provided by support vector machine (SVM). Furthermore, based on DHN, all four levels of fusion strategies were used for multi-modal recognition of palmprint and DHV. Evaluation experiments and comprehensive comparisons were conducted on various commonly used datasets, and the promising results were obtained in this case where the equal error rates (EERs) of both palmprint recognition and multi-biometrics equal 0, demonstrating the great superiority of DHN in biometric verification.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security of a full-duplex base station (BS)-aided system in the worst case, where an uplink transmitter (UT) and a downlink receiver (DR) are equipped with a single antenna, while a powerful eavesdropper is equipped with multiple antennas. For securing the confidentiality of signals transmitted from the BS and UT, an artificial noise (AN)-aided secrecy beamforming scheme is proposed, which is robust to the realistic imperfect state information of both the eavesdropping channel and the residual self-interference channel. Our objective function is that of maximizing the worst-case sum secrecy rate achieved by the BS and UT, through jointly optimizing the beamforming vector of the confidential signals and the transmit covariance matrix of the AN. However, the resulting optimization problem is non-convex and non-linear. In order to efficiently obtain the solution, we transform the non-convex problem into a sequence of convex problems by adopting the block coordinate descent algorithm. We invoke a linear matrix inequality for finding its Karush&#x2013;Kuhn&#x2013;Tucker (KKT) solution. In order to evaluate the achievable performance, the worst-case secrecy rate is analytically derived. Furthermore, we construct another secrecy transmission scheme using the projection matrix theory for performance comparison. Our simulation results show that the proposed robust secrecy transmission scheme achieves substantial secrecy performance gains, which verifies the efficiency of the proposed method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We propose a novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-inspired jamming and relaying scheme to enhance the physical layer security of untrusted relay networks. Particularly, during the first phase, with the application of the downlink NOMA principle, the source sends a superimposed version of a desired signal and a jamming signal, where the jamming signal is designed to deliberately confuse the untrusted relay by exploiting the beamforming design and adapting the transmission rate at the source. During the second phase, relying on the uplink NOMA principle, the untrusted relay forwards its received signals and, simultaneously, the source transmits a new desired signal that cannot be wiretapped by the untrusted relay to maximize the secrecy sum rate. Scenarios of single-antenna and multiple-antenna relaying are considered, and the impact of different antenna configurations at the source and the untrusted relay on the secrecy performance is investigated. Analytical expressions of an ergodic secrecy sum rate (ESSR) lower bound and an asymptotic ESSR scaling law are derived to evaluate the secrecy performance of the proposed NOMA-inspired jamming and relaying scheme. Computer simulations are presented to validate the accuracy of the derived analytical results, and demonstrate the significant ESSR improvement of the proposed scheme over the conventional orthogonal multiple access-based relaying schemes.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In cyberspace, evolutionary strategies are commonly used by both attackers and defenders. For example, an attacker&#x2019;s strategy often changes over the course of time, as new vulnerabilities are discovered and/or mitigated. Similarly, a defender&#x2019;s strategy changes over time. These changes may or may not be in direct response to a change in the opponent&#x2019;s strategy. In any case, it is important to have a set of quantitative metrics to characterize and understand the effectiveness of attackers&#x2019; and defenders&#x2019; evolutionary strategies, which reflect their cyber agility. Despite its clear importance, few systematic metrics have been developed to quantify the cyber agility of attackers and defenders. In this paper, we propose the first metric framework for measuring cyber agility in terms of the effectiveness of the dynamic evolution of cyber attacks and defenses. The proposed framework is generic and applicable to transform any relevant, quantitative, and/or conventional static security metrics (e.g., false positives and false negatives) into dynamic metrics to capture dynamics of system behaviors. In order to validate the usefulness of the proposed framework, we conduct case studies on measuring the evolution of cyber attacks and defenses using two real-world datasets. We discuss the limitations of the current work and identify future research directions.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>For the five-phase permanent magnet (PM) machines with conventional Halbach array rotor, although the third harmonic current is injected into the phase current, the torque density hardly increases due to the absence of the third harmonic air gap flux density. Hence, a Halbach array considering third harmonic air gap flux density is proposed in this paper, and the topology is described and compared with the conventional Halbach array. The magnetizing angle of the proposed Halbach array and the stator teeth width are optimized based on the nonlinear programing method. The electromagnetic performances of the five-phase PM machines with the proposed Halbach array, including open-circuit flux density, back electromotive force, flux density under the rated load, cogging torque, average torque, torque ripple, loss, and efficiency, are compared with the PM machine with conventional Halbach array by finite-element method. It is demonstrated that the torque density and efficiency of the PM machine with the proposed Halbach array are higher than that of the PM machine with conventional Halbach array. Finally, the five-phase 10-slot&#x002f;8-pole PM machines with proposed Halbach array is manufactured and tested to verify the analysis.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>AC&#x2013;DC light-emitting diode (LED) drivers suffer from short lifetime because of the low-lifetime electrolytic capacitors used for dc bus decoupling. In this paper, a primary-side peak current control method applied for driving a two-stage multichannel LED driver is proposed. The LED driver consists of an ac&#x2013;dc boost power factor correction stage and an isolated dc&#x2013;dc nonresonant stage. A long-lifetime and small film capacitor is used for implementing the intermediate dc bus. The proposed method, which controls the peak value of the primary-side current of the transformers, is applied to the dc&#x2013;dc stage to ensure constant dc current output of LEDs in spite of the widely varying dc bus voltage due to low bus capacitance. The proposed method compensates the effect of the large dc bus voltage ripple by varying the switching frequency of the primary-side switches. Detailed design procedure, theoretical analysis, and experimental results of the LED driver operating at 180 W with the proposed method are provided. The LED driver with the proposed control method is proved to have high overall efficiency.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The objective of this paper is to develop a method for assisting users to push power-assisted wheelchairs (PAWs) in such a way that the electrical energy consumption over a predefined distance-to-go is optimal, while at the same time bringing users to a desired fatigue level. This assistive task is formulated as an optimal control problem and solved by Feng et al. using the model-free approach gradient of partially observable Markov decision processes. To increase the data efficiency of the model-free framework, we here propose to use policy learning by weighting exploration with the returns (PoWER) with 25 control parameters. Moreover, we provide a new near-optimality analysis of the finite-horizon fuzzy Q-iteration, which derives a model-based baseline solution to verify numerically the near-optimality of the presented model-free approaches. Simulation results show that the PoWER algorithm with the new parameterization converges to a near-optimal solution within 200 trials and possesses the adaptability to cope with changes of the human fatigue dynamics. Finally, 24 experimental trials are carried out on the PAW system, with fatigue feedback provided by the user via a joystick. The performance tends to increase gradually after learning. The results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness and the feasibility of PoWER in our application.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent years have witnessed the promising future of hashing in the industrial applications for fast similarity retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised hashing method for large-scale cross-media search, termed self-supervised deep multimodal hashing (SSDMH), which learns unified hash codes as well as deep hash functions for different modalities in a self-supervised manner. With the proposed regularized binary latent model, unified binary codes can be solved directly without relaxation strategy while retaining the neighborhood structures by the graph regularization term. Moreover, we propose a new discrete optimization solution, termed as binary gradient descent, which aims at improving the optimization efficiency toward real-time operation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets demonstrate the superiority of SSDMH over state-of-the-art cross-media hashing approaches.

<p>In this paper, we propose an efficient inter prediction scheme by introducing the deep virtual reference frame (VRF), which serves better reference in the temporal redundancy removal process of video coding. In particular, the high quality VRF is generated with the deep learning-based frame rate up conversion (FRUC) algorithm from two reconstructed bi-directional frames, which is subsequently incorporated into the reference list serving as the high quality reference. Moreover, to alleviate the compression artifacts of VRF, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based enhancement model to further improve its quality. To facilitate better utilization of the VRF, a CTU level coding mode termed as direct virtual reference frame (DVRF) is devised, which achieves better trade-off between compression performance and complexity. The proposed scheme is integrated into HM-16.6 and JEM-7.1 software platforms, and the simulation results under random access (RA) configuration demonstrate significant superiority of the proposed method. When adding VRF to RPS, more than 6&#x0025; average BD-rate gain is achieved for HEVC test sequences on HM-16.6, and 0.8&#x0025; BD-rate gain is observed based on JEM-7.1 software. Regarding the DVRF mode, 3.6&#x0025; bitrate saving is achieved on HM-16.6 with the computational complexity effectively reduced.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep convolutional neural networks have been applied by automobile industries, Internet giants, and academic institutes to boost autonomous driving technologies; while progress has been witnessed in environmental perception tasks, such as object detection and driver state recognition, the scene-centric understanding and identification still remain a virgin land. This mainly encompasses two key issues: 1) the lack of shared large datasets with comprehensively annotated road scene information and 2) the difficulty to find effective ways to train networks concerning the bias of category samples, image resolutions, scene dynamics, and capturing conditions. In this paper, we make two contributions: 1) we introduce a large-scale dataset with over 110 k images, dubbed DrivingScene, covering traffic scenarios under different weather conditions, road structures, and environmental instances and driving places, which is the first large-scale dataset for multi-class traffic scenes classification and 2) we propose a multi-label neural network for road scene recognition, which incorporates both single- and multi-class classification modes into a multi-level cost function for training with imbalanced categories and utilizes a deep data integration strategy to improve the classification ability on hard samples. The experimental results on DrivingScene and PASCAL VOC demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in handling the challenge of data imbalance.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Singular value thresholding (SVT)- or nuclear norm minimization (NNM)-based nonlocal image denoising methods often rely on the precise estimation of the noise variance. However, most existing methods either assume that the noise variance is known or require an extra step to estimate it. Under the iterative regularization framework, the error in the noise variance estimate propagates and accumulates with each iteration, ultimately degrading the overall denoising performance. In addition, the essence of these methods is still least squares estimation, which can cause a very high mean-squared error (MSE) and is inadequate for handling missing data or outliers. In order to address these deficiencies, we present a hybrid denoising model based on variational Bayesian inference and Stein&#x2019;s unbiased risk estimator (SURE), which consists of two complementary steps. In the first step, the variational Bayesian SVT performs a low-rank approximation of the nonlocal image patch matrix to simultaneously remove the noise and estimate the noise variance. In the second step, we modify the conventional SURE full-rank SVT and its divergence formulas for rank-reduced eigen-triplets to remove the residual artifacts. The proposed hybrid BSSVT method achieves better performance in recovering the true image compared with state-of-the-art methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The ability to recognize actions throughout a video is essential for surveillance, self-driving, and many other applications. Although many researchers have investigated deep neural networks to get a better result in video action recognition, these networks usually require a large number of well-labeled data to train. In this paper, we introduce a dense dilated network to collect action information from snippet-level to global-level. The dilated dense network is composed of the blocks with densely connected dilated convolutions layers. Our proposed framework is capable of fusing outputs from each layer to learn high-level representations, and these representations are robust even with only a few training snippets. We study different spatial and temporal modality fusing configurations and introduce a novel temporal guided fusion upon the dense dilated network which can further boost the performance. We conduct extensive experiments on two popular video action datasets: UCF101 and HMDB51. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose a uniform and variational deep learning (UVDL) method for RGB-D object recognition and person re-identification. Unlike most existing object recognition and person re-identification methods, which usually use only the visual appearance information from RGB images, our method recognizes visual objects and persons with RGB-D images to exploit more reliable information such as geometric and anthropometric information that are robust to different viewpoints. Specifically, we extract the depth feature and the appearance feature from the depth and RGB images with two deep convolutional neural networks, respectively. In order to combine the depth feature and the appearance feature to exploit their relationship, we design a uniform and variational multi-modal auto-encoder at the top layer of our deep network to seek a uniform latent variable by projecting them into a common space, which contains the whole information of RGB-D images and has small intra-class variation and large inter-class variation, simultaneously. Finally, we optimize the auto-encoder layer and two deep convolutional neural networks jointly to minimize the discriminative loss and the reconstruction error. The experimental results on both RGB-D object recognition and RGB-D person re-identification are presented to show the efficiency of our proposed approach.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org">EurekAlert! - Breaking News</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A new study led by Dr. Antonella Fioravanti in the lab of Prof. Han Remaut (VIB-VUB Center for Structural Biology) has shown that removing the armor of the bacterium that causes anthrax slows its growth and negatively affects its ability to cause disease. This work will be published in the prestigious journal Nature Microbiology can lead the way to new, effective ways of fighting anthrax and various other diseases.
