<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is a fast growing field of devices being added
to an interconnected environment in an abstract heterogeneous array of servers
and other devices, called smart environments, ranging from private local (home)
environments to nation-wide infrastructures, often accessible via unsecured
wireless communications and information technologies, hence, massively open to
attacks. In this paper we address some of issues that arise when connecting
smart devices endowed with low computational capabilities to a home gateway via
unsecured wireless communication channels, by using a One Time Pad (OTP)
protocol based upon an On-the-fly Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange. Our assumptions
are that only a user and the gateway have enough processing power to perform -
say - secured RSA encrypted communication, hence relaxing the need for a
trusted secure server outside the domain and that the protocol should at least
be secure for a range of known attacks, as replay or DoS attacks.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>By expanding the connection of objects to the Internet and their entry to
human life, the issue of security and privacy has become important. In order to
enhance security and privacy on the Internet, many security protocols have been
developed. Unfortunately, the security analyzes that have been carried out on
these protocols show that they are vulnerable to one or few attacks, which
eliminates the use of these protocols. Therefore, the need for a security
protocol on the Internet of Things (IoT) has not yet been resolved.
</p>
<p>Recently, Khor and Sidorov cryptanalyzed the Wang et al. protocol and
presented an improved version of it. In this paper, at first, we show that this
protocol also does not have sufficient security and so it is not recommended to
be used in any application. More precisely, we present a full secret disclosure
attack against this protocol, which extracted the whole secrets of the protocol
by two communication with the target tag.
</p>
<p>In addition, Sidorv et al. recently proposed an ultralightweight mutual
authentication RFID protocol for blockchain enabled supply chains, supported by
formal and informal security proofs. However, we present a full secret
disclosure attack against this protocol as well.

<p>In this paper we present an open source, fully asynchronous, leaderless
algorithm for reaching consensus in the presence of Byzantine faults in an
asynchronous network. We prove the algorithm's correctness provided that less
than a third of participating nodes are faulty. We also present a way of
applying the algorithm to a network with dynamic membership, i.e. a network in
which nodes can join and leave at will. The core contribution of this paper is
an optimal model in the definition of an asynchronous BFT protocol, and which
is resilient to 1/3 byzantine nodes. This model matches an agreement with
probability one (unlike some probabilistic methods), and where a common coin is
used as a source of randomization so that it respects the FLP impossibility
result.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Online advertising, the backbone of the free Web, has transformed the
marketing business by creating countless opportunities for advertisers to reach
potential customers. The advertising ecosystem exists upon a complex
infrastructure composed by intermediate entities and technologies whose main
goal is to deliver personalized ads to such customers. In recent years,
however, advertisers have started to develop new advanced techniques such as
Cross-Device Tracking, to detect and track the user's activity across multiple
devices and target them on the all possible device. For this method to work, a
variety of user data is collected, aggregated, processed and traded behind the
scenes, and often times, without the user-data owner's informed consent.
Therefore, despite the enormous value of online advertising and support it
offers to the Web, the prevalence and intensity of these tracking and targeting
practices prompt serious concerns for the online users' privacy.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for systematically
investigating Cross-Device Tracking and various components affecting its
targeting performance. We materialize our methodology into a platform that is
able to perform small and large scale automated measurements, under different
experimental scenarios, emulated users and settings. By conducting a variety of
measurements with our framework, we are able to detect and measure Cross-Device
Tracking with average accuracy of 78-96%, and also report significant insights
about its internal mechanisms and its impact on online user's privacy.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Differential privacy is a useful tool to build machine learning models which
do not release too much information about the training data. We study the
R\'enyi differential privacy of stochastic gradient descent when each training
example is sampled without replacement (also known as cyclic SGD). Cyclic SGD
is typically faster than traditional SGD and is the algorithm of choice in
large-scale implementations. We recover privacy guarantees for cyclic SGD which
are competitive with those known for sampling with replacement. Our proof
techniques make no assumptions on the model or on the data and are hence widely
applicable.

He said he had a lump that appeared intermittently in the area, and because of this, he regularly wore firm underwear. In his medical history, it was noted that 9 years earlier he had undergone an open flat mesh repair of a left inguinal hernia. 14 months later, however, the problem had recurred; at this stage, he was managed by a different surgeon&#8212;who had not been involved in the original operation&#8212;who did a further open mesh repair.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents an ultra-high-frequency (UHF) passive sense tag for electrical grid and substation thermal monitoring, with emphasis on the tag system optimization and the design of a low power embedded temperature sensor. The designed tag achieves a sensitivity of -12.3 dBm under active temperature monitoring operation, which is the state of the art among existing UHF passive temperature sense tag products. The sensing inaccuracy of the tag is &#x00b1;2.5 &#x00b0;C (3&#x03c3;) from -25 to 120 &#x00b0;C after a low-cost wireless single-point trim. An antimetal ceramic-packaged tag was tested by attaching to a ring main unit in the substation and complete tag system demonstrated robust wireless operation with a sensing distance of 3.5 m. The combination of batteryless and wireless operation, high sensitivity, wide sensing range, and small incident-power-dependent error (&#x00b1;0.2 &#x00b0;C) makes this tag suitable for the target applications.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Solid state transformer (SST) integrated hybrid dc-ac microgrid (HMG) has wide operating capabilities in presence of dc-ac loads, renewable energy resources, and energy storage. This paper proposes control strategies for localized control of zonal hybrid microgrid, enabled by the SST and centralized energy storage devices (ESD) integrated using dual active bridge (DAB) converter. The control of DAB dc-dc converter is modified for zero circulating power flow (ZCPF) operation in both SST and ESD. Power management and coordination control used in this paper ensures the power supply reliability of the zonal HMG integrated through the SST. Microgrid system, along with its proposed controllers, provides a stabilized low-voltage dc and ac network ports, in both grid feeding and forming modes. The performance of the configured HMG system is evaluated under various power management scenarios using the MATLAB software platform. Further, the SST architecture, with its proposed controller, is tested on FPGA-based hardware platform.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Filgotinib is an oral, small-molecule inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK)&#8211;signal transducer and activator of transcription, JAK1, one of the several subtypes of the enzyme. Four JAKs exist in humans: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and nonreceptor tyrosine-protein kinase TYK2. These kinases bind to types I and II cytokine receptors and transmit extracellular cytokine signals to activate various signal transducers and activators of transcription, which drive the proinflammatory machinery of the cellular immune response. Two other JAK inhibitor drugs, tofacitinib and baricitinib, have been approved in the United States for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Tofacitinib preferentially inhibits JAK1, JAK3, and to a lesser extent JAK2. Baricitinib inhibits JAK1 and JAK2.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Dynamic software watermarking is one of the major countermeasures against software licensing violations. However, conventional dynamic watermarking approaches have exhibited a number of weaknesses including exploitable payload semantics, exploitable embedding/recognition procedures, and weak correlation between payload and subject software. This paper presents a novel dynamic watermarking method, Xmark, which leverages a well-known unsolved mathematical problem referred to as the Collatz conjecture. Our method works by transforming selected conditional constructs (which originally belonged to the software to be watermarked) with a control flow obfuscation technique based on Collatz conjecture. These obfuscation routines are built in a particular way such that they are able to express a watermark in the form of iteratively executed branching activities occurred during computing the aforementioned conjecture. Exploiting the one-to-one correspondence between natural numbers and their orbits computed by the conjecture (also known as the &#x201c;Hailstone sequences&#x201d;), Xmark's watermark-related activities are designed to be insignificant without the pre-defined secret input. Meanwhile, being integrated with obfuscation techniques, our method is able to resist attacks based on various reverse engineering techniques on both syntax and semantic levels. Analyses and simulations indicated that Xmark could evade detections via pattern matching and model checking, and meanwhile effectively prohibit dynamic symbolic execution. We have also shown that our method could remain robust even if a watermarked software is compromised via re-obfuscation using approaches like control flow flattening.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Age synthesis is a challenging task due to the complicated and non-linear transformation in the human aging process. Aging information is usually reflected in local facial parts, such as wrinkles at the eye corners. However, these local facial parts contribute less in previous GAN-based methods for age synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet-domain global and local consistent age generative adversarial network (WaveletGLCA-GAN), in which one global specific network and three local specific networks are integrated together to capture both global topology information and local texture details of human faces. Different from the most existing methods that modeling age synthesis in image domain, we adopt wavelet transform to depict the textual information in frequency domain. Moreover, five types of losses are adopted: 1) adversarial loss aims to generate realistic wavelets; 2) identity preserving loss aims to better preserve identity information; 3) age preserving loss aims to enhance the accuracy of age synthesis; 4) pixel-wise loss aims to preserve the background information of the input face; and 5) the total variation regularization aims to remove ghosting artifacts. Our method is evaluated on three face aging datasets, including CACD2000, Morph, and FG-NET. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show the superiority of the proposed method over other state-of-the-arts.

Instead, a user makes security decisions based on the cyber risks that he perceives by observing a selected number of nodes. To this end, we propose a model which incorporates the limited attention or bounded rationality nature of players in the IoT. Specifically, each individual builds a sparse cognitive network of nodes to respond to. Based on this simplified cognitive network representation, each user then determines his security management policy by minimizing his own real-world security cost. The bounded rational decision-makings of players and their cognitive network formations are interdependent and thus should be addressed in a holistic manner. We establish a games-in-games framework and propose a Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE) solution concept to characterize the decisions of agents and quantify their risk of bounded perception due to the limited attention. In addition, we design a proximal-based iterative algorithm to compute the GNE. With case studies of smart communities, the designed algorithm can successfully identify the critical users whose decisions need to be taken into account by the other users during the security management.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper considers the scenario that multiple data owners wish to apply a machine learning method over the combined dataset of all owners to obtain the best possible learning output but do not want to share the local datasets owing to privacy concerns. We design systems for the scenario that the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm is used as the machine learning method, because SGD (or its variants) is at the heart of recent deep learning techniques over neural networks. Our systems differ from the existing systems in the following features: 1) any activation function can be used, meaning that no privacy-preserving-friendly approximation is required; 2) gradients computed by SGD are not shared but the weight parameters are shared instead; and 3) robustness against colluding parties even in the extreme case that only one honest party exists. One of our systems requires a shared symmetric key among the data owners (trainers) to ensure the secrecy of the weight parameters against a central server. We prove that our systems, while privacy preserving, achieve the same learning accuracy as SGD and, hence, retain the merit of deep learning with respect to accuracy. Finally, we conduct several experiments using benchmark datasets and show that our systems outperform the previous system in terms of learning accuracies.

<p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been undergoing fast development for providing broader signal coverage and more extensive surveillance capabilities in military and civilian applications. Due to the broadcast nature of the wireless signal and the openness of the space, UAV eavesdroppers (UEDs) pose a potential threat to ground communications. In this paper, we consider the communications of a legitimate ground link in the presence of friendly jamming and UEDs within a finite area of space. The spatial distribution of the UEDs obeying a uniform binomial point process (BPP) is used to characterize the randomness of the UEDs. The ground link is assumed to experience log-distance path loss and Rayleigh fading, while free space path loss with/without the averaged excess path loss due to the environment is used for the air-to-ground/air-to-air links. A piecewise function is proposed to approximate the line-of-sight (LoS) probability for the air-to-ground links, which provides a better approximation than using the existing sigmoid-based fitting. The analytical expression for the secure connection probability (SCP) of the legitimate ground link in the presence of non-colluding UEDs is derived. The analysis reveals some useful trends in the SCP as a function of the transmit signal to jamming power ratio, the locations of the UAV jammer, and the height of UAVs.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Industrial and commercial electricity customers have significant potential in providing flexibility for power systems through diverse demand response (DR) programs. However, the industrial and commercial potential of DR is not yet completely understood, especially regarding the emerging and advanced technologies associated with the smart grid. Advances in smart meter technology that allow monitoring and controlling responsive loads in real time will also be key enablers of DR potential. It can be more complex to implement DR for industrial loads if compared to residential loads mainly due to the reliability management that is more vital for industrial plants. Hence, this paper aims at providing a comprehensive review of the most recent advances on industrial and commercial DR. On this basis, this survey first presents the potential and technologies of DR in industrial and commercial sectors. Then, the existing models of DR in the mentioned sectors are presented. The presence of industrial and commercial DR in electricity markets is also investigated. Finally, the main positive and beneficial aspects, as well as challenges and barriers of industrial and commercial DR, are investigated.

<p>It is widely agreed that future manufacturing environments will be populated by humans and robots sharing the same workspace. However, the real collaboration can be sporadic, especially in the case of assembly tasks, which might involve autonomous operations to be executed by either the robot or the human worker. In this scenario, it might be beneficial to predict the actions of the human in order to control the robot both safely and efficiently. In this paper, we propose a method to predict human activity patterns in order to early infer when a specific collaborative operation will be requested by the human and to allow the robot to perform alternative autonomous tasks in the meanwhile. The prediction algorithm is based on higher-order Markov chains and is experimentally verified in a realistic scenario involving a dual-arm robot employed in a small part collaborative assembly task.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes an optimal power scheduling strategy for cooperative operation of multiple-coupled microgrids, where the microgrid coalition makes day-ahead energy exchange commitments with the grid. Deviations from their commitments are limited by penalizing the microgrids. Various system intermittencies are captured via scenarios. The framework aims at maximizing the expected profit of each microgrid, while mitigating the distribution power losses by enabling local power trades between all microgrids within a coalition. The scheduling problem only utilizes the power exchange requests as the control signals between participating microgrids. Extensive numerical results are presented to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

<p>The growing number of attacks against cyber-physical systems in recent years elevates the concern for cybersecurity of industrial control systems (ICSs). The current efforts of ICS cybersecurity are mainly based on firewalls, data diodes, and other methods of intrusion prevention, which may not be sufficient for growing cyber threats from motivated attackers. To enhance the cybersecurity of ICS, a cyber-attack detection system built on the concept of defense-in-depth is developed utilizing network traffic data, host system data, and measured process parameters. This attack detection system provides multiple-layer defense in order to gain the defenders precious time before unrecoverable consequences occur in the physical system. The data used for demonstrating the proposed detection system are from a real-time ICS testbed. Five attacks, including man in the middle (MITM), denial of service (DoS), data exfiltration, data tampering, and false data injection, are carried out to simulate the consequences of cyber attack and generate data for building data-driven detection models. Four classical classification models based on network data and host system data are studied, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree, bootstrap aggregating (bagging), and random forest (RF), to provide a secondary line of defense of cyber-attack detection in the event that the intrusion prevention layer fails. Intrusion detection results suggest that KNN, bagging, and RF have low missed alarm and false alarm rates for MITM and DoS attacks, providing accurate and reliable detection of these cyber attacks. Cyber attacks that may not be detectable by monitoring network and host system data, such as command tampering and false data injection attacks by an insider, are monitored for by traditional process monitoring protocols. In the proposed detection system, an auto-associative kernel regression model is studied to strengthen early attack detection. The result shows that this approach de-
ects physically impactful cyber attacks before significant consequences occur. The proposed multiple-layer data-driven cyber-attack detection system utilizing network, system, and process data is a promising solution for safeguarding an ICS.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Energy imbalance market (EIM) provides an opportunity that allows larger shares of variable renewable energy sources in the grid. Under highly volatile weather conditions, an accurate forecasting of photovoltaic (PV) power is necessary for grid stability and market operation. Most of existing forecasting methods strongly rely on the accuracy of measurements, and the adaptability of these methods to complex weather conditions is rarely discussed. In this paper, a weather classification multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) forecasting model is introduced for complex weather conditions in all seasons. It can be updated incrementally and its high computational efficiency satisfies EIM operations. A data set that consists of the historical power and meteorological parameters produced by a small-scale PV platform is classified and used to train MARS models with forecast horizons ranging from 15 min to 24 h in different seasons. The tests and analyses results indicate higher accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency of the novel model.

<p>In this paper, a two-degrees-of-freedom control algorithm based on uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE), aimed to minimize the total harmonic distortion of inverter output voltage is proposed, possessing enhanced robustness to fundamental frequency variations. A multiple-time-delay action is combined with a commonly utilized low-pass UDE filter to increase the range of output impedance magnitude minimization around odd multiples of fundamental frequency for enhanced rejection of typical single-phase nonlinear loads harmonics. Marginal robustness improvement achieved by increasing the number of time delays is quantified analytically and revealed to be independent of delay order. The performance of the proposed control approach and its superiority over two recently proposed methods is validated successfully by experimental results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The back-to-back (BTB) converter is one of the most popular converter topologies for the control of electrical machines, power transmission systems, and power quality applications. The conventional cascade control structure is commonly used due to its simple design procedure and reliable operation. However, the bandwidth of the dc-link voltage controller has to be limited in order to avoid instability issues and be restrictive in high-performance applications. This paper presents a differential- and common-current (power)-based state-feedback control for BTB converters. This controller features a fast control of active and reactive powers, and a stiff regulation of the dc-link voltage. A theoretical analysis of the proposed controller along with a strategy for current limiting is presented. Its robustness was tested against variations of the filter parameters, the dc capacitance, the grid inductance, and the grid voltage values. The controller was experimentally validated under nominal operation, voltage sags, and connected to a weak grid by using a 15-kVA BTB converter in a laboratory test network.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Filtering images of more than one channel are challenging in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. By grouping similar patches to utilize the self-similarity and sparse linear approximation of natural images, recent nonlocal and transform-domain methods have been widely used in color and multispectral image (MSI) denoising. Many related methods focus on the modeling of group level correlation to enhance sparsity, which often resorts to a recursive strategy with a large number of similar patches. The importance of the patch level representation is understated. In this paper, we mainly investigate the influence and potential of representation at patch level by considering a general formulation with a block diagonal matrix. We further show that by training a proper global patch basis, along with a local principal component analysis transform in the grouping dimension, a simple transform-threshold-inverse method could produce very competitive results. Fast implementation is also developed to reduce the computational complexity. The extensive experiments on both the simulated and real datasets demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness, and efficiency.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose and develop a novel nonlocal variational technique based on structural similarity (SS) information for image restoration problems. In the literature, patches extracted from images are compared according to their pixel values, and then nonlocal filtering can be employed for image restoration. The disadvantage of this approach is that intensity-based patch distance may not be effective in image restoration, especially for images containing texture or structural information. The main aim of this paper is to propose using SS between image patches to develop nonlocal regularization models. In particular, two types of nonlocal regularizing functions are studied: an SS-based nonlocal quadratic function (SS-NLH1) and an SS-based nonlocal total variation function (SS-NLTV) for regularization of image restoration problems. Moreover, we employ iterative algorithms to solve these SS-NLH1 and SS-NLTV variational models numerically and discuss the convergence of these algorithms. The experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Capturing images at high ISO modes will introduce much realistic noise, which is difficult to be removed by traditional denoising methods. In this paper, we propose a novel denoising method for high ISO JPEG images via deep fusion of collaborative and convolutional filtering. Collaborative filtering explores the non-local similarity of natural images, while convolutional filtering takes advantage of the large capacity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to infer noise from noisy images. We observe that the noise variance map of a high ISO JPEG image is spatial-dependent and has a Bayer-like pattern. Therefore, we introduce the Bayer pattern prior in our noise estimation and collaborative filtering stages. Since collaborative filtering is good at recovering repeatable structures and convolutional filtering is good at recovering irregular patterns and removing noise in flat regions, we propose to fuse the strengths of the two methods via deep CNN. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art realistic noise removal methods for a wide variety of testing images in both subjective and objective measurements. In addition, we construct a dataset with noisy and clean image pairs for high ISO JPEG images to facilitate research on this topic.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Semantic segmentation, a pixel-level vision task, is rapidly developed by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Training CNNs requires a large amount of labeled data, but manually annotating data is difficult. For emancipating manpower, in recent years, some synthetic datasets are released. However, they are still different from real scenes, which causes that training a model on the synthetic data (source domain) cannot achieve a good performance on real urban scenes (target domain). In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised adversarial domain adaptation to improve the segmentation performance from synthetic data to real scenes, which consists of three deep neural networks. A detection and segmentation (DS) model focuses on detecting objects and predicting segmentation map; a pixel-level domain classifier (PDC) tries to distinguish the image features from which domains; and an object-level domain classifier (ODC) discriminates the objects from which domains and predicts object classes. PDC and ODC are treated as the discriminators, and DS is considered as the generator. By the adversarial learning, DS is supposed to learn domain-invariant features. In experiments, our proposed method yields the new record of mIoU metric in the same problem.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Multi-illuminant-based color constancy (MCC) is quite a challenging task. In this paper, we proposed a novel model motivated by the bottom-up and top-down mechanisms of human visual system (HVS) to estimate the spatially varying illumination in a scene. The motivation for bottom-up based estimation is from our finding that the bright and dark parts in a scene play different roles in encoding illuminants. However, handling the color shift of large colorful objects is difficult using pure bottom-up processing. Thus, we further introduce a top-down constraint inspired by the findings in visual psychophysics, in which high-level information (e.g., the prior of light source colors) plays a key role in visual color constancy. In order to implement the top-down hypothesis, we simply learn a color mapping between the illuminant distribution estimated by bottom-up processing and the ground truth maps provided by the dataset. We evaluated our model on four datasets and the results show that our method obtains very competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art MCC algorithms. Moreover, the robustness of our model is more tangible considering that our results were obtained using the same parameters for all the datasets or the parameters of our model were learned from the inputs, that is, mimicking how HVS operates. We also show the color correction results on some real-world images taken from the web.
