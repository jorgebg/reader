<p>The content of a reform for WHO came as somewhat of a surprise to many in the global health community. After Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in his inaugural speech, said &#8220;I do not believe in perpetual reform and I think WHO staff are reformed out&#8221;, WHO's Director-General unveiled the result of a 20-month-long consultation for reform. Aimed to be &#8220;the most wide-ranging reforms in the organisation's history&#8221;, according to the accompanying press release, this reform is a substantial top-heavy redesign of the internal structure of the WHO Secretariat.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Kawasaki disease is an acute childhood vasculitis that causes coronary artery aneurysms and is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in high-income countries.1 The cause is not known and, hence, the diagnosis and treatment remain empirical and prevention is not possible. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) continues to be the mainstay of acute treatment, reducing the risk of aneurysms from about 25% to 4%. However, around 20% of patients do not respond to initial treatment with IVIG, variably increasing the risk of aneurysms.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel screen-shooting resilient watermarking scheme, which means that if the watermarked image is displayed on the screen and the screen information is captured by the camera, we can still extract the watermark message from the captured photo. To realize such demands, we analyzed the special distortions caused by the screen-shooting process, including lens distortion, light source distortion, and moire&#x0301; distortion. To resist the geometric deformation caused by lens distortion, we proposed an intensity-based scale-invariant feature transform (I-SIFT) algorithm which can accurately locate the embedding regions. As for the loss of image details caused by light source distortion and moire&#x0301; distortion, we put forward a small-size template algorithm to repeatedly embed the watermark into different regions, so that at least one complete information region can survive from distortions. At the extraction side, we designed a cross-validation-based extraction algorithm to cope with repeated embedding. The validity and correctness of the extraction method are verified by hypothesis testing. Furthermore, to boost the extraction speed, we proposed a SIFT feature editing algorithm to enhance the intensity of the keypoints, based on which, the extraction accuracy and extraction speed can be greatly improved. The experimental results show that the proposed watermarking scheme achieves high robustness for screen-shooting process. Compared with the previous schemes, our algorithm provides significant improvement in robustness for screen-shooting process and extraction efficiency.

<p><span class="paragraphSection">Just as skill in perspective drawing is necessary for proficiency in painting and sculpture, a mastership in anatomy opens the door to all purposeful work in medicine. The period of Galen, emphasizing rational anatomy and physiology as a corrective to even the brightest hippocratic philosophies of form and function, significantly runs synchronously with the highest development in Greek art. Galen&#8217;s inductive school dominated practically all natural and medical science until the advent of the Renaissance, when medicine, till then a unit, burst into the cluster of component disciplines natural history, physiology, geology, chemistry, physics, astronomy and mechanics. When Vesalius in the sixteenth century instituted the teaching of anatomy by dissections of the human body, the laboratory method recorded its first victory over the didactic. No wonder, then, that the name of Andreas Vesalius took a high place in medical consciousness.</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Because of the dynamic nature of network traffic patterns, such as new traffic application arrivals or flash events, it is becoming increasingly difficult for conventional anomaly detection systems to separate various applications based on their traffic patterns. In this paper, by leveraging transport layer packet-level and flow-level features, new structures called application fingerprints are generated, which express such features in a compact and efficient manner. Based on the generated fingerprints, we propose a novel traffic classification framework. The proposed system generates profiles of normal applications using a multi-modal probability distribution. The proposed classification framework is then extended to detect distributed denial of service attacks from the collected statistical information at flow level. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system, we evaluate its performance using five real-world traffic datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method is capable of achieving an accuracy of over 97%, whereas the misclassification rate is only 2.5%.

<p>In this paper, we examine the physical layer security of a cooperative relay network where two source-destination pairs communicate through a decode-and-forward (DF) relay in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. To safeguard the legitimate communications against eavesdropping, we propose a novel two-stage secure relay selection (TSSRS) with a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme to maximize the capacity of one source-destination pair, while guaranteeing the successful communication of the other source-destination pair. To explicitly reveal the benefits of our proposed scheme, we derive the exact and asymptotic expressions for its secrecy outage probability. As a benchmark, we also analyze the secrecy performance of the TSSRS strategy with an orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that our proposed TSSRS-NOMA scheme significantly outperforms the TSSRS-OMA scheme when the transmit power at the source and relay is in the low and medium regimes. In addition, we show that the advantage of the TSSRS-NOMA scheme over the TSSRS-OMA scheme becomes obvious when the two source-destination pairs have profoundly different secrecy requirements.

<p>The existing malware analysis platforms leave detectable fingerprints such as uncommon string properties in QEMU, signatures in Android Java virtual machine, and artifacts in Linux kernel profiles. Since these fingerprints provide the malware a chance to split its behavior depending on whether the analysis system is present or not, the existing analysis systems are not sufficient to analyze the sophisticated malware. In this paper, we propose NINJA, a transparent malware analysis framework on the ARM platform with low artifacts. NINJA leverages a hardware-assisted isolated execution environment TrustZone to transparently trace and debug a target application with the help of performance monitor unit and embedded trace macrocell. These hardware features help NINJA to achieve transparency while avoiding heavy performance overhead. NINJA does not modify system software and is OS-agnostic on the ARM platform. We implement a prototype of NINJA (i.e., tracing and debugging subsystems), and the experimental results show that NINJA is efficient and transparent for malware analysis. An improved fast system restoration mechanism is also designed to facilitate the continuous malware analysis.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel bilinear projections model for unsupervised learning, which can be directly applied to dimension reduction and feature extraction for image analysis. Compared to previous 2-dimensional (2D) methods, our method seeks multiple rank- $k$  bilinear projections (MRBP), which makes a balance between two opposite problems of enhancing the degree of freedom and avoiding the problem of over-fitting by adjusting  $k$ . Besides, each renewed feature in our method is extracted independently, rather than dimensions reduced by row or column like before, and thus our reduced dimension is not restricted by the size of a sample. In addition, we demonstrate that our model could be optimized via two equivalent optimization problems based on the criteria of maximum separability and nearest reconstruction respectively. Motivated by this, the corresponding robust version (RMRBP) achieving a better performance to occluded data is introduced as well. Extensive experiments on several datasets have been done to verify the effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A large number of industrial video applications are expected to work in real-time and power-constrained scenarios. For such applications, the coding complexity has a great impact on their performance. In this paper, we propose a complexity control method in the high-efficiency video coding intracoding to facilitate these video applications. The proposed method is performed on the coding tree unit&#x00a0;(CTU) level, which consists of three steps, namely complexity estimation, complexity allocation, and prediction unit&#x00a0;(PU) adaption. In the first step, a complexity estimation model is proposed to estimate the coding complexity of each CTU based on the sum of absolute transformed difference. Then, the complexity budget is allocated to each CTU proportionally to its estimated coding complexity. In PU adaption, only a subset of PU sizes are selected for the CTU according to its allocated complexity and prediction performance. A feedback-based error elimination scheme removes the complexity error during the encoding process. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to adjust the complexity ratio from 100&#x0025; to 20&#x0025;. Meanwhile, the rate-distortion performance and complexity control accuracy of the proposed method are superior to those of the state-of-the-art methods.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Real-time multiple event analysis is important for reliable situational awareness and secure operation of the power system. Multiple sequential events can induce complex superimposed pattern in the data and are challenging to analyze in real time. This paper proposes a method for accurate detection, temporal localization, and classification of multiple events in real time using synchrophasor data. For detection and temporal localization, a Teager&#x2013;Kaiser energy operator (TKEO) based method is proposed. For event classification, a time series classification based method using energy similarity measure (ESM) is proposed. The proposed method is tested for simulated multiple event cases in the IEEE-118 bus system using DigSilent/PowerFactory and real PMU data for the Indian grid.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we consider false data injection (FDI) attacks with limited information of transmission-line susceptances and new countermeasures in smart grids. First, we prove that the adversary could launch FDI attacks to modify the state variable on a bus or superbus only if he/she knows the susceptance of every transmission line that is incident to that bus or superbus. Based on this observation, we provide a new countermeasure against FDI attacks, i.e., to make the susceptances of $n-1$ interconnected transmission lines that cover all buses unknown to the adversary (e.g., by proactively perturbing transmission-line susceptances through distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) devices), where $n$ is the total number of buses. This new countermeasure can work alone or in conjunction with traditional ones to reduce the number of meter measurements/state variables that are to be secured against FDI attacks. The implementation of FDI attacks with limited susceptance information and the effectiveness of new countermeasures are demonstrated by using an illustrative 4-bus power system and the IEEE 9-bus, 14-bus, 30-bus, 118-bus, and 300-bus test power systems.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The autonomous operation of industrial robots with minimal human supervision has always been in high demand. To prepare the autonomous operation of a car part spray painting robot, novel object detection, and pose estimation algorithms have been developed in this paper. The object detection part used principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of three-dimensional (3-D) point cloud to 2-D binary image. Distance measure between the auto and cross correlation of the binary features was established to find out the similarity between them. Resultantly, the type of auto part was successfully obtained. Furthermore, iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm was used to estimate the pose difference of the auto part with respect to the camera reference frame, which was mounted on the robot. An issue with ICP&#x0027;s lack of robustness to local minimum was solved by the combination of ICP and genetic algorithm (GA). This allowed the optimization of pose error and addressed the problem of local minimum entrapment in ICP. For experimental validation: the proposed object recognition pipeline was implemented in both serial and parallel programming paradigms. The results were obtained for the acquired point clouds of side body car parts and compared with the major 3-D object detection systems in terms of computational cost. Pose estimation error was calculated with both ICP and the modified point set registration schemes, and it was shown to be decreasing in the case of later. All shown results supported the research claims.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents the framework of a power-dispatching automation system (PDAS) based on a virtual private cloud, which extracts advantages of technologies, such as a virtual private cloud, a virtual private network, an https protocol, etc. Unlike existing on-premise or public cloud hosted PDASs that are vulnerable and may be subject to blackouts due to extreme conditions, such as natural disasters or cyberattacks, the proposed framework operates more safely and securely under those conditions, while at the same time meeting the reliability requirements for power systems as well. This paper presents the theory, architectural design, characteristics, and implementation process of the system, as well as its reliability and cyber security measurements. The annual failure time of the proposed system is reduced from 61.2 to about 0.43 min, about 142 times less than those of existing PDASs. This framework has been implemented in the Lipu power system in China since May 2016. Results show that the proposed system is reliable, safe, and cost-effective, with a bright prospect for future applications.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this work, the design of a novel the flexure-linked dual-drive H-gantry is first introduced. Compared to conventional stacked X&#x2013;Y tables, the advantages of this gantry are on decoupled X&#x2013;Y actuation, better mechanical reliability, larger driving force, and shorter response time. However, after deriving its reduced-order dynamical model, it is found that the precision of the end-effector is significantly affected by the position dependent torque caused by the inter-parallel-axes driving forces on the fixed inertia frame and coupling forces from the pair of flexures. These form barriers that limit precision positioning and tracking performance over a large workspace. Thus, in the following part, a robust integral of signum of error (RISE) control with novel jerk adaptation is proposed on top of the standard proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and feedforward scheme. Compared with some prior RISE schemes with gain adaptation, the proposed scheme yields bounded robust gain in the presence of noisy velocity estimation. Real-time experiments on the actual testbed indicate that both improvement of motion precision and prevention of resonant mode excitation over a large workspace are successfully achieved in the proposed scheme.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Despite the recent advances on intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings, existing research works mostly assume training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution. However, due to variation of operating condition, domain shift phenomenon generally exists, which results in significant diagnosis performance deterioration. To address cross-domain problems, latest research works preferably apply domain adaptation techniques on marginal data distributions. However, it is usually assumed that sufficient testing data are available for training, that is not in accordance with most transfer tasks in real industries where only data in machine healthy condition can be collected in advance. This paper proposes a novel cross-domain fault diagnosis method based on deep generative neural networks. By artificially generating fake samples for domain adaptation, the proposed method is able to provide reliable cross-domain diagnosis results when testing data in machine fault conditions are not available for training. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method offers a promising approach for industrial applications.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Accurate estimation of power capacity is critical to ensure battery safety margins and optimize energy utilization. Power capacity estimators based on online identified equivalent circuit model have been widely investigated due to the high accuracy and affordable computing cost. However, the impact of noise corruption which is common in practice on such estimators has never been investigated. This paper scrutinizes the effect of noises on model identification, state of charge (SOC) and power capacity estimation. An online model identification method based on adaptive forgetting recursive total least squares (AF-RTLS) is proposed to compensate the noise effect and attenuate the identification bias of model parameters. A Luenberger observer is further used in combination with the AF-RTLS to estimate the SOC in real time. Leveraging the estimated model parameters and SOC, a multiconstraint analytical method is proposed to online estimate the power capacity. Simulation and experimental results verify that the proposed method is superior in terms of estimation accuracy and the robustness to noise corruption.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fractional interpolation is used to provide sub-pixel level references for motion compensation in the interprediction of video coding, which attempts to remove temporal redundancy in video sequences. Traditional handcrafted fractional interpolation filters face the challenge of modeling discontinuous regions in videos, while existing deep learning-based methods are either designed for a single quantization parameter (QP), only generating half-pixel samples, or need to train a model for each sub-pixel position. In this paper, we present a one-for-all fractional interpolation method based on a grouped variation convolutional neural network (GVCNN). Our method can deal with video frames coded using different QPs and is capable of generating all sub-pixel positions at one sub-pixel level. Also, by predicting variations between integer-position pixels and sub-pixels, our network offers more expressive power. Moreover, we perform specific measurements in training data generation to simulate practical situations in video coding, including blurring the down-sampled sub-pixel samples to avoid aliasing effects and coding integer pixels to simulate reconstruction errors. In addition, we analyze the impact of the size of blur kernels theoretically. Experimental results verify the efficiency of GVCNN. Compared with HEVC, our method achieves 2.2% in bit saving on average and up to 5.2% under low-delay P configuration.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) botnets have become one of the major threats in network security for serving as the fundamental infrastructure for various cyber-crimes. More challenges are involved in the problem of detecting P2P botnets, despite a few work claimed to detect centralized botnets effectively. We propose an enhanced PeerHunter, a network-flow level community behavior analysis based system, to detect P2P botnets. Our system starts from a P2P network flow detection component. Then, it uses &#x201c;mutual contacts&#x201d; to cluster bots into communities. Finally, it uses network-flow level community behavior analysis to detect potential botnets. In the experimental evaluation, we propose two evasion attacks, where we assume the adversaries know our techniques in advance and attempt to evade our system by making the P2P bots mimic the behavior of legitimate P2P applications. Our results showed that enhanced PeerHunter can obtain high detection rate with few false positives, and high robustness against the proposed attacks.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Using multi-atlas registration (MAR), information carried by atlases can be transferred onto a new input image for the tasks of region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation, anatomical landmark detection, and so on. Conventional atlases used in MAR methods are monomodal and contain only normal anatomical structures. Therefore, the majority of MAR methods cannot handle input multimodal pathological images, which are often collected in routine image-based diagnosis. This is because registering monomodal atlases with normal appearances to multimodal pathological images involves two major problems: 1) missing imaging modalities in the monomodal atlases and 2) influence from pathological regions. In this paper, we propose a new MAR framework to tackle these problems. In this framework, deep learning-based image synthesizers are applied for synthesizing multimodal normal atlases from conventional monomodal normal atlases. To reduce the influence from pathological regions, we further propose a multimodal low-rank approach to recover multimodal normal-looking images from multimodal pathological images. Finally, the multimodal normal atlases can be registered to the recovered multimodal images in a multi-channel way. We evaluate our MAR framework via brain ROI segmentation of multimodal tumor brain images. Due to the utilization of multimodal information and the reduced influence from pathological regions, experimental results show that registration based on our method is more accurate and robust, leading to significantly improved brain ROI segmentation compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Stereoscopic saliency detection plays an important role in various stereoscopic video processing applications. However, conventional stereoscopic video saliency detection methods mainly use independent low-level features instead of extracting them automatically, and thus, they ignore the intrinsic relationship between the spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel stereoscopic video saliency detection method based on 3D convolutional neural networks, namely, deep 3D video saliency (Deep3DSaliency). The proposed network consists of two sub-models: spatiotemporal saliency model (STSM) and stereoscopic saliency aware model (SSAM). STSM directly takes three consecutive video frames as the input to extract visual spatiotemporal features, while SSAM attempts to further infer the depth and semantic features from the left and right video frames by shared parameters from STSM. The visual spatiotemporal features from STSM and the depth and semantic features from SSAM are learned by an alternating optimization scheme. Finally, all these saliency-related features are combined together for the final stereoscopic saliency detection via 3D deconvolution. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed model over other existing ones in saliency estimation for 3D video sequences.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The 360&#x00b0; video compression has two main challenges due to projection distortions, namely, the geometry distortion and the face boundary discontinuity. There are some tradeoffs between selecting equi-rectangular projection (ERP) and polyhedron projection. In ERP, the geometry distortion is severer than the face boundary discontinuity; while for the polyhedron projections, the face boundary discontinuity is severer than the geometry distortion. These two distortions will have side effects on the motion compensation and undermine the compression efficiency of the 360&#x00b0; video. In this paper, an integrated framework is developed to handle these two problems to improve coding efficiency. The proposed framework mainly has two key contributions. First, we derive a unified advanced spherical motion model to handle the geometry distortion of different projection formats for the 360&#x00b0; video. When fitting the projection between the various projection formats and the sphere into the unified framework, a specific solution can be obtained for each projection format. Second, we propose a local 3D padding method to handle the face boundary discontinuity between the neighboring faces in various projection formats of the 360&#x00b0; video. The local 3D padding method can be applied to different projection formats through setting different angles between neighboring faces. These two methods are independent of each other and can also be combined into an integrated framework to achieve a better rate-distortion performance. The proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into the latest video coding standard high-efficiency video coding. The experimental results demonstrate that introducing proposed coding tools can achieve significant bitrate savings compared with the current state-of-the-art method.
