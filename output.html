<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org">EurekAlert! - Breaking News</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Researchers at Tokyo Tech have revealed that an artificial receptor preferentially binds male steroid hormones from a mixture of male and female hormones in water. Based on their findings, they succeeded in the preparation of a prototype detection system for male hormones at the nanogram level. This achievement could lead to the development of ultrasensitive analytical devices for medical diagnostics and anti-doping testing in sports.

<p>Despite considerable progress, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) estimates that 30% of the population of the Americas still do not have access to the health care they need because of multifaceted barriers. On April 9, leaders, including Mexico's President Andr&#233;s Manuel L&#243;pez Obrador, PAHO director Carissa Etienne, and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, gathered with academics, activists, and representatives of social movements in Mexico City to hear the report of the Commission on Universal Health in the 21st Century.

<p>Understanding of the neurobiology of pain continues to increase at a remarkable pace, raising optimism for improvements in pain therapy. Physicians can choose from multiple classes of medications to treat acute or chronic pain that can often be highly effective. Many patients, however, do not have their pain well controlled with available drugs, and these drugs often have severe side-effects that can ultimately diminish quality of life and potentially result in serious harm.1 Hence, the need for new medicines for treatment of pain remains very high.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Incidence of angle-closure disease was very low among individuals classified as primary angle closure suspects identified through community-based screening. Laser peripheral iridotomy had a modest, albeit significant, prophylactic effect. In view of the low incidence rate of outcomes that have no immediate threat to vision, the benefit of prophylactic laser peripheral iridotomy is limited; therefore, widespread prophylactic laser peripheral iridotomy for primary angle-closure suspects is not recommended.

We present a novel approach to conducting no-reference artifact detection in digital videos, implemented as an efficient and unique dual-path (parallel) excitatory/inhibitory neural network that uses a simple discrimination rule to define a bank of accurate distortion detectors. The learning engine is distortion-sensitized by pre-processing each video using a statistical image model. The overall system is able to produce full-resolution space-time distortion maps for visualization, providing global distortion detection decisions that represent the state of the art in performance. Our model, which we call the video impairment mapper (VIDMAP), produces a first-of-a-kind full-resolution map of artifact detection probabilities. The current realization of this system is able to accurately detect and map eight of the most important artifact categories encountered during streaming video source inspection: aliasing, video encoding corruptions, quantization, contours/banding, combing, compression, dropped frames, and upscaling artifacts. We show that it is either competitive with or significantly outperforms the previous state of the art on the whole-image artifact detection task. A software release of VIDMAP that has been trained to detect and map these artifacts is available online: http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/quality/VIDMAP_release.zip for public use and evaluation.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as the most popular classification models in biometrics research. Under the discriminative paradigm of pattern recognition, CNNs are used typically in one of two ways: (1) verification mode (&#x201c; are samples from the same person? &#x201d;), where pairs of images are provided to the network to distinguish between genuine and impostor instances and (2) identification mode (&#x201c; whom is this sample from? &#x201d;), where appropriate feature representations that map images to identities are found. This paper postulates a novel mode for using CNNs in biometric identification, by learning models that answer the question &#x201c; is the query's identity among this set? &#x201d;. The insight is a reminiscence of the classical Mastermind game: by iteratively analyzing the network responses when multiple random samples of k gallery elements are compared to the query, we obtain weakly correlated matching scores that, altogether, provide solid cues to infer the most likely identity. In this setting, identification is regarded as a variable selection and regularization problem, with sparse linear regression techniques being used to infer the matching probability with respect to each gallery identity. As main strength, this strategy is highly robust to outlier matching scores, which are known to be a primary error source in biometric recognition. Our experiments were carried out in full versions of two well-known irises near-infrared (CASIA-IrisV4-Thousand) and periocular visible wavelength (UBIRIS.v2) datasets, and confirm that recognition performance can be solidly boosted-up by the proposed algorithm, when compared with the traditional working modes of CNNs in biometrics.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We present an image captioning framework that generates captions under a given topic. The topic candidates are extracted from the caption corpus. A given image's topics are then selected from these candidates by a CNN-based multi-label classifier. The input to the caption generation model is an image-topic pair, and the output is a caption of the image. For this purpose, a cross-modal embedding method is learned for the images, topics, and captions. In the proposed framework, the topic, caption, and image are organized in a hierarchical structure, which is preserved in the embedding space by using the order-embedding method. The caption embedding is upper bounded by the corresponding image embedding and lower bounded by the topic embedding. The lower bound pushes the images and captions about the same topic closer together in the embedding space. A bidirectional caption-image retrieval task is conducted on the learned embedding space and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the embedding method. To generate a caption for an image, an embedding vector is sampled from the region bounded by the embeddings of the image and the topic, then a language model decodes it to a sentence as the output. The lower bound set by the topic shrinks the output space of the language model, which may help the model to learn to match images and captions better. Experiments on the image captioning task on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets validate the usefulness of this framework by showing that the different given topics can lead to different captions describing specific aspects of the given image and that the quality of generated captions is higher than the control model without a topic as input. In addition, the proposed method is competitive with many state-of-the-art methods in terms of standard evaluation metrics.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>As the problem of three-phase unbalance in a distribution network with distributed generations (DGs) is prominent, a multiobjective dynamic reconfiguration method for three-phase balance is proposed to make reconfiguration more reasonable and effective. Based on three-phase power flow calculation and reconfiguration process analysis of distribution networks with DGs, a new reconfiguration model with comprehensive optimization objectives of minimizing three-phase unbalance factor and number of switching times are established. A network connectivity discrimination method based on the algebraic connectivity of graph theory is adopted to quickly remove infeasible solutions, and a new multiobjective molecular differential evolution algorithm is designed to improve optimization depth and avoid prematurity in the optimization process, which is based on the principle of closer molecules with greater intermolecular repulsion. The multiobjective optimal dynamic reconfiguration of a modified IEEE 34-bus test feeder with DGs is carried out and the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, an output feedback finite-time control method is investigated for stabilizing the perturbed vehicle active suspension system to improve the suspension performance. Since physical suspension systems always exist in the phenomenon of uncertainty or external disturbance, a novel disturbance compensator with finite-time convergence performance is proposed for efficiently compensating the unknown external disturbance. Moreover, the presented compensator is advantageous over the existing ones since it is continuous and can completely remove the matched disturbance. From the viewpoint of practical implementation, continuous control law will not lead to chattering, which is desirable for electrical and mechanical systems. For the nominal suspension system without disturbance, a homogeneous controller with a simple filter is constructed to achieve a finite-time convergence property, where the filter is applied to obtain the unknown velocity signal. Thus, the nominal controller combines a disturbance compensator into an overall continuous control law, which provides two independent parts with a separate design unit and a high flexibility for selecting the control gains. According to the geometric homogeneity and finite-time separation principle, it can be shown that the active suspension is finite-time stabilized. A designed example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented controller for improving the vehicle ride performance.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In actual production processes, the occurrence probability of multiple faults is much higher than that of a single fault, which will affect the process industry operating performance and final products quality. This paper is concerned with industrial practices and theoretical approaches for detection and location of key performance indicator (KPI) related multiple faults in process industries. First, a new KPI-related multiple fault monitoring scheme is addressed from the subprocess level based on the developed correlation-based canonical variable analysis model. Then, Bayesian fusion is implemented to form the final monitoring decisions from the plantwide level. After that, a tensor subspace analysis-based discriminant analysis method is proposed for locating the root causes, which will help field engineers to take correction actions and recover the process operations. Finally, the application to a typical industry process, i.e., hot strip mill process, is given to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed methods with real industrial data.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The two-way communication of information between agents in the smart grid, while making way for better monitoring and control, comes at the cost of elevated communication traffic. Compressive sensing is a technique that exploits sparsity of power consumption data (in the Haar basis) and achieves sub-Nyquist compression. Household power consumption data, however, have varying sparseness due to, for example, multistate appliances. Compressing this data with a fixed ratio can lead to nonoptimal results (less compression or large reconstruction error). In this regard, a dynamic compression scheme that estimates a signal&#x0027;s sparsity and decides the amount of compression is desirable. We demonstrate that this approach, when applied with existing estimators of sparsity, has its limitations in overemphasizing one objective compared to the other. We propose a new measure derived from coefficient of variation and demonstrate that it achieves a better tradeoff between reconstruction performance and compression ratio. In addition, we employ a dynamic spatial compression scheme to account for spatial correlation between data of neighboring nodes and present a framework that incorporates dynamic temporal and spatial compression. We present the results on three publicly available datasets at different sampling rates and outline key findings of the study.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep computation, as an advanced machine learning model, has achieved the state-of-the-art performance for feature learning on big data in industrial Internet of Things (IoT). However, the current deep computation model usually suffers from overfitting due to the lack of public available labeled training samples, limiting its performance for big data feature learning. Motivated by the idea of active learning, an adaptive dropout deep computation model (ADDCM) with crowdsourcing to cloud is proposed for industrial IoT big data feature learning in this paper. First, a distribution function is designed to set the dropout rate for each hidden layer to prevent overfitting for the deep computation model. Furthermore, the outsourcing selection algorithm based on the maximum entropy is employed to choose appropriate samples from the training set to crowdsource on the cloud platform. Finally, an improved supervised learning from multiple experts scheme is presented to aggregate answers given by human workers and to update the parameters of the ADDCM simultaneously. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the presented model by comparing with the dropout deep computation model and other state-of-the-art crowdsourcing algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can prevent overfitting effectively and aggregate the labeled samples to train the parameters of the deep computation model with crowdsouring for industrial IoT big data feature learning.

Other advantages include a less number of active components and their lower ratings and a higher efficiency. In addition, a lower magnetic core size is required for the proposed ZSNs due to the lower peak magnetizing current. The performance principles and detailed comparative analysis are provided and confirmed through experiments on a 200-W dc&#x2013;dc converter.

<p>This paper provides robust $mathcal {H}_{infty }$ state feedback controllers suitable for implementation in three-phase grid-connected converters. This control strategy is known to provide optimal rejection of disturbances, but usually leads to high control gains, that may be difficult to be implemented in practice. To mitigate this problem, a linear matrix inequality condition based on slack variables is proposed, which allows to impose bounds on the control gains in a less conservative way than conventional quadratic stability. The performance is proven to be superior to similar $mathcal {H}_{infty }$ state feedback controllers in the literature, providing an upper bound for the converter output admittance and experimental grid currents complying with the IEEE Standard 1547.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Cogging torque, inherent in permanent magnet machines, is closely related to the airgap flux density harmonic contents. The third harmonic can be utilized in combination with the fundamental one to increase the average torque, whilst its relationship with cogging torque is uncertain. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of third harmonic in airgap flux density on cogging torque in surface-mounted permanent magnet (SPM) machines considering different slot&#x002f;pole (S&#x002f;P) combinations. First, based on the simplified expressions of cogging torque in machines with sinusoidal plus third harmonic (Sine&#x002b;3rd) airgap flux density, S&#x002f;P combinations are classified into four cases for discussion. It is found that when N<sub>s</sub> &#x002f;GCD (N<sub>s</sub>, N<sub>p</sub>) &#x2265; 4 (N<sub>s</sub>: slot number; N<sub>p</sub>: pole number; GCD: great common divisor), third harmonic in airgap flux density has no effect on cogging torque. Otherwise, cogging torque will be generated. Furthermore, two approaches for obtaining the Sine and Sine&#x002b;3rd airgap flux density, i.e., Sine&#x002f;Sine&#x002b;3rd h<sub>m</sub> and Sine&#x002f;Sine&#x002b;3rd B<sub>r</sub>, are validated, based on which finite-element analyses are carried out on four machines, i.e., 12-slot&#x002f;10-pole (12S12P), 12S6P, 12S8P, and 12S10P to verify the conclusion. Finally, the 12S8P and 12S10P Sine&#x002b;3rd SPM machines are prototyped and tested for validation.

<p>In this paper, the fixed-time leader-following consensus problem is investigated for high-order multivariable multiagent systems with external disturbances. A new distributed observer is proposed for each follower under a directed information flow to estimate the leader state in a fixed time. Based on the observer, a novel tracking controller is designed such that the estimated leader state is tracked with disturbance rejection in a fixed time. Consensus conditions are established to guarantee the fixed-time stability. Different from some existing finite-/fixed-time consensus approaches, an explicit estimate for the upper bound of the settling time is derived, which provides additional system specification in advance. Moreover, for disturbance rejection, the chattering phenomenon is effectively reduced by using a distributed multivariable signum function. Finally, illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the theoretical results.

First, predictor-based state transformation is employed for each robot to deal with the input delay, and the uncertain terms remained in the transformed systems are carefully considered. Then, a couple of nonlinear fixed-time formation protocols are proposed for the multirobot systems with respectively undirected and directed topology, and the corresponding settling time is derived by using the Lyapunov functions. In particular, the upper-bound estimation of the formation settling time is explicitly given irrelevant to the initial conditions. Finally, the protocols are validated through a numerical simulation example and then implemented on an E-puck robots platform. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation protocols.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In real-world applications, different kinds of learning and prediction errors are likely to incur different costs for the same system. Moreover, in practice, the cost label information is often available only for a few training samples. In a semi-supervised setting, label propagation is critical to infer the cost information for unlabeled training data. The existing methods typically conduct label propagation independently ahead of supervised cost-sensitive learning. The precomputed label information is kept fixed, which may become suboptimal in the subsequent learning process and hence degrade the overall system performance. In this paper, we develop a unified cost-sensitive framework for semi-supervised face recognition that can jointly optimize the inferred label information and the classifier in an iterative manner. Our experiments on face benchmark datasets demonstrate that in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods for label propagation and cost-sensitive learning, the proposed approach can significantly improve the overall system performance, especially in terms of classification errors associated with high costs.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Digital reconstruction of mechanically shredded documents has received increasing attention in the last years mainly for historical and forensics needs. Computational methods to solve this problem are highly desirable in order to mitigate the time-consuming human effort and to preserve document integrity. The reconstruction of strips-shredded documents is accomplished by horizontally splicing pieces so that the arising sequence (solution) is as similar as the original document. In this context, a central issue is the quantification of the fitting between the pieces (strips), which generally involves stating a function that associates a pair of strips to a real value indicating the fitting quality. This problem is also more challenging for text documents, such as business letters or legal documents, since they depict poor color information. The system proposed here addresses this issue by exploring character shapes as visual features for compatibility computation. Experiments conducted with real mechanically shredded documents showed that our approach outperformed in accuracy other popular techniques in the literature considering documents with (almost) only textual content.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Efficient security patch distribution is of essential importance for updating anti-virus software to ensure effective and timely virus detection and cleanup. In this paper, we propose a mixed strategy of patch distribution to combine the advantages of the traditional centralized patch distribution strategy and decentralized patch distribution strategy. A novel network model that contains a central node and a multiplex network composed of patch dissemination network layer and virus propagation network layer is presented, and a competing spreading dynamical process on top of the network model that simulates the interplay between virus propagation and patch dissemination is developed. Such a new framework helps in effectively analyzing the impacts of patches distribution on virus propagation, and developing more realizable schemes for restraining virus propagation. Furthermore, considering the constraints of the capacity of the central node and the bandwidth of network links, an optimal allocation approach of patches is proposed, which could simultaneously optimize multiple dynamical parameters to effectively restrain the virus propagation with a given budget.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The connected vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) and cloud computing technology allows entities in VANET to enjoy the advantageous storage and computing services offered by some cloud service provider. However, the advantages do not come free, since their combination brings many new security and privacy requirements for VANET applications. In this paper, we investigate the cloud-based road condition monitoring (RCoM) scenario, where the authority needs to monitor real-time road conditions with the help of a cloud server so that it could make sound responses to emergency cases timely. When some bad road condition is detected, e.g., some geologic hazard or accident happens, vehicles on site are able to report such information to a cloud server engaged by the authority. We focus on addressing three key issues in RCoM. First, the vehicles have to be authorized by some roadside unit before generating a road condition report in the domain and uploading it to the cloud server. Second, to guarantee the privacy against the cloud server, the road condition information should be reported in ciphertext format, which requires that the cloud server should be able to distinguish the reported data from different vehicles in ciphertext format for the same place without compromising their confidentiality. Third, the cloud server and authority should be able to validate the report source, i.e., to check whether the road conditions are reported by legitimate vehicles. To address these issues, we present an efficient RCoM scheme, analyze its efficiency theoretically, and demonstrate the practicality through experiments.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fractional-pel accurate motion is widely used in video coding. For subband coding, fractional-pel accuracy is challenging since it is difficult to handle the complex motion field with temporal transforms. In our previous work, we designed integer accurate motion-adaptive transforms (MAT) which can transform integer accurate motion-connected coefficients. In this paper, we extend the integer MAT to fractional-pel accuracy. The integer MAT allows only one reference coefficient to be the lowband coefficient. In this paper, we design the transform such that it permits multiple references and generates multiple lowband coefficients. In addition, our fractional-pel MAT can incorporate a general interpolation filter into the basis vector, such that the highband coefficient produced by the transform is the same as the prediction error from the interpolation filter. The fractional-pel MAT is always orthonormal. Thus, the energy is preserved by the transform. We compare the proposed fractional-pel MAT, the integer MAT, and the half-pel motion-compensated orthogonal transform (MCOT), while HEVC intra coding is used to encode the temporal subbands. The experimental results show that the proposed fractional-pel MAT outperforms the integer MAT and the half-pel MCOT. The gain achieved by the proposed MAT over the integer MAT can reach up to 1 dB in PSNR.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Hypergraph learning has been widely exploited in various image processing applications, due to its advantages in modeling the high-order information. Its efficacy highly depends on building an informative hypergraph structure to accurately and robustly formulate the underlying data correlation. However, the existing hypergraph learning methods are sensitive to non-Gaussian noise, which hurts the corresponding performance. In this paper, we present a noise-resistant hypergraph learning model, which provides superior robustness against various non-Gaussian noises. In particular, our model adopts low-rank representation to construct a hypergraph, which captures the globally linear data structure as well as preserving the grouping effect of highly correlated data. We further introduce a correntropy-induced local metric to measure the reconstruction errors, which is particularly robust to non-Gaussian noises. Finally, the Frobenious-norm-based regularization is proposed to combine with the low-rank regularizer, which enables our model to regularize the singular values of the coefficient matrix. By such, the non-zero coefficients are selected to generate a hyperedge set as well as the hyperedge weights. We have evaluated the proposed hypergraph model in the tasks of image clustering and semi-supervised image classification. Quantitatively, our scheme significantly enhances the performance of the state-of-the-art hypergraph models on several benchmark data sets.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we study the problem of cross-modal retrieval by hashing-based approximate nearest neighbor search techniques. Most existing cross-modal hashing works mainly address the issue of multi-modal integration complexity using the same mapping and similarity calculation for data from different media types. Nonetheless, this may cause information loss during the mapping process due to overlooking the specifics of each individual modality. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective cross-modal hashing approach, termed collective reconstructive embeddings (CRE), which can simultaneously solve the heterogeneity and integration complexity of multi-modal data. To address the heterogeneity challenge, we propose to process heterogeneous types of data using different modality-specific models. Specifically, we model textual data with cosine similarity-based reconstructive embedding to alleviate the data sparsity to the greatest extent, while for image data, we utilize the Euclidean distance to characterize the relationships of the projected hash codes. Meanwhile, we unify the projections of text and image to the Hamming space into a common reconstructive embedding through rigid mathematical reformulation, which not only reduces the optimization complexity significantly but also facilitates the inter-modal similarity preservation among different modalities. We further incorporate the code balance and uncorrelation criteria into the problem and devise an efficient iterative algorithm for optimization. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used multimodal benchmarks show that the proposed CRE can achieve a superior performance compared with the state of the art on several challenging cross-modal tasks.
