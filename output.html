<div class="itemdescription">
<p>&#8220;Tuberculosis is one of the world's most neglected health crises. In spite of its alarming danger, surprisingly little action has been taken to address the TB [tuberculosis] epidemic. TB has been a low priority on the world's health agenda. Every day, I ask why this situation is allowed to continue&#8230;Can we really believe that millions of people are dying from TB each year when an inexpensive cure is available? Can we comprehend the magnitude of this injustice?&#8221;1 This statement was made by the then WHO Tuberculosis Programme manager Arata Kochi in 1994 in the wake of WHO declaring tuberculosis a global emergency.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/issue/current">The Lancet</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A quarter of a century since WHO declared tuberculosis an emergency, tuberculosis still kills more people than any other infectious disease. It is time for leadership, actions, and innovations. Tuberculosis needs the attention of world leaders and high-level decision makers to dramatically accelerate progress to achieve the target of ending tuberculosis under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The UN General Assembly High-Level Political Declaration in September, 2018, made ending tuberculosis a global priority.

<p>&#8220;This England&#8212;is it worth fighting for?&#8221; The question hangs over Kate Atkinson's immensely successful 2018 novel, Transcription. Although not ostensibly about Brexit, Atkinson's subject is idealism and identity, forces that have shaped, many might say distorted, Britain's present sense of self. Most doctors, public health practitioners, and medical scientists oppose Brexit. Today, they&#8212;we&#8212;see a nation shamed by humiliation, an erosion of national confidence, and the loss of global reputation. And despair&#8212;despair at the partisan manipulation of public opinion, despair at the violent divisiveness of political debate, despair at a growing constitutional emergency.

<p>The study showed successful weight-loss maintainers rely on physical activity to remain in energy balance (rather than chronic restriction of dietary intake) to avoid weight regain. Successful weight-loss maintainers are individuals who maintain a reduced body weight of 30 pounds or more for over a year. The study, published in the March issue of Obesity, was selected as the Editor's Choice article.

<p>A challenge of dengue infection -- for which 40 percent of the global population is at risk -- is that it can be caused by one of four versions of the virus, and infection by one type only protects for that version and can cause more severe disease following infection with another type. A new study uncovers details about the human immune response that could help with successful vaccine development.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as the most popular classification models in biometrics research. Under the discriminative paradigm of pattern recognition, CNNs are used typically in one of two ways: 1) verification mode (&#x201c; are samples from the same person? &#x201d;), where pairs of images are provided to the network to distinguish between genuine and impostor instances and 2) identification mode (&#x201c; whom is this sample from? &#x201d;), where appropriate feature representations that map images to identities are found. This paper postulates a novel mode for using CNNs in biometric identification, by learning models that answer the question &#x201c; is the query&#x2019;s identity among this set? &#x201d;. The insight is a reminiscence of the classical Mastermind game: by iteratively analyzing the network responses when multiple random samples of  $k$  gallery elements are compared to the query, we obtain weakly correlated matching scores that, altogether, provide solid cues to infer the most likely identity. In this setting, identification is regarded as a variable selection and regularization problem, with sparse linear regression techniques being used to infer the matching probability with respect to each gallery identity. As main strength, this strategy is highly robust to outlier matching scores, which are known to be a primary error source in biometric recognition. Our experiments were carried out in full versions of two well-known irises near-infrared (CASIA-IrisV4-Thousand) and periocular visible wavelength (UBIRIS.v2) datasets, and confirm that recognition performance can be solidly boosted-up by the proposed algorithm, when c-
mpared with the traditional working modes of CNNs in biometrics.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In real-world applications, different kinds of learning and prediction errors are likely to incur different costs for the same system. Moreover, in practice, the cost label information is often available only for a few training samples. In a semi-supervised setting, label propagation is critical to infer the cost information for unlabeled training data. The existing methods typically conduct label propagation independently ahead of supervised cost-sensitive learning. The precomputed label information is kept fixed, which may become suboptimal in the subsequent learning process and hence degrade the overall system performance. In this paper, we develop a unified cost-sensitive framework for semi-supervised face recognition that can jointly optimize the inferred label information and the classifier in an iterative manner. Our experiments on face benchmark datasets demonstrate that in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods for label propagation and cost-sensitive learning, the proposed approach can significantly improve the overall system performance, especially in terms of classification errors associated with high costs.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Digital reconstruction of mechanically shredded documents has received increasing attention in the last years mainly for historical and forensics needs. Computational methods to solve this problem are highly desirable in order to mitigate the time-consuming human effort and to preserve document integrity. The reconstruction of strips-shredded documents is accomplished by horizontally splicing pieces so that the arising sequence (solution) is as similar as the original document. In this context, a central issue is the quantification of the fitting between the pieces (strips), which generally involves stating a function that associates a pair of strips to a real value indicating the fitting quality. This problem is also more challenging for text documents, such as business letters or legal documents, since they depict poor color information. The system proposed here addresses this issue by exploring character shapes as visual features for compatibility computation. Experiments conducted with real mechanically shredded documents showed that our approach outperformed in accuracy other popular techniques in the literature considering documents with (almost) only textual content.

<p>Efficient security patch distribution is of essential importance for updating anti-virus software to ensure effective and timely virus detection and cleanup. In this paper, we propose a mixed strategy of patch distribution to combine the advantages of the traditional centralized patch distribution strategy and decentralized patch distribution strategy. A novel network model that contains a central node and a multiplex network composed of patch dissemination network layer and virus propagation network layer is presented, and a competing spreading dynamical process on top of the network model that simulates the interplay between virus propagation and patch dissemination is developed. Such a new framework helps in effectively analyzing the impacts of patches distribution on virus propagation, and developing more realizable schemes for restraining virus propagation. Furthermore, considering the constraints of the capacity of the central node and the bandwidth of network links, an optimal allocation approach of patches is proposed, which could simultaneously optimize multiple dynamical parameters to effectively restrain the virus propagation with a given budget.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The connected vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) and cloud computing technology allows entities in VANET to enjoy the advantageous storage and computing services offered by some cloud service provider. However, the advantages do not come free, since their combination brings many new security and privacy requirements for VANET applications. In this paper, we investigate the cloud-based road condition monitoring (RCoM) scenario, where the authority needs to monitor real-time road conditions with the help of a cloud server so that it could make sound responses to emergency cases timely. When some bad road condition is detected, e.g., some geologic hazard or accident happens, vehicles on site are able to report such information to a cloud server engaged by the authority. We focus on addressing three key issues in RCoM. First, the vehicles have to be authorized by some roadside unit before generating a road condition report in the domain and uploading it to the cloud server. Second, to guarantee the privacy against the cloud server, the road condition information should be reported in ciphertext format, which requires that the cloud server should be able to distinguish the reported data from different vehicles in ciphertext format for the same place without compromising their confidentiality. Third, the cloud server and authority should be able to validate the report source, i.e., to check whether the road conditions are reported by legitimate vehicles. To address these issues, we present an efficient RCoM scheme, analyze its efficiency theoretically, and demonstrate the practicality through experiments.

<p>Video summarization is a challenging task, mainly due to the difficulties in learning complicated semantic structural relations between videos and summaries. In this paper, we present a novel supervised video summarization scheme based on three-stage deep neural networks. The scheme takes a divide-and-conquer strategy to resolve the complicated task of 3D video summarization into a set of easy and flexible computational subtasks, and then to sequentially perform 2D CNNs, 1D CNNs, and long short-term memory to address the subtasks in an hierarchical fashion. The hierarchical modeling of spatio&#x2013;temporal structure leads to high performance and efficiency. In addition, we propose a simple but effective user-ranking method to cope with the labeling subjectivity problem of user-created video summarization, leading to the labeling quality refinement for robust supervised learning. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art video summarization methods on two benchmark datasets.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fractional-pel accurate motion is widely used in video coding. For subband coding, fractional-pel accuracy is challenging since it is difficult to handle the complex motion field with temporal transforms. In our previous work, we designed integer accurate motion-adaptive transforms (MAT) which can transform integer accurate motion-connected coefficients. In this paper, we extend the integer MAT to fractional-pel accuracy. The integer MAT allows only one reference coefficient to be the lowband coefficient. In this paper, we design the transform such that it permits multiple references and generates multiple lowband coefficients. In addition, our fractional-pel MAT can incorporate a general interpolation filter into the basis vector, such that the highband coefficient produced by the transform is the same as the prediction error from the interpolation filter. The fractional-pel MAT is always orthonormal. Thus, the energy is preserved by the transform. We compare the proposed fractional-pel MAT, the integer MAT, and the half-pel motion-compensated orthogonal transform (MCOT), while HEVC intra coding is used to encode the temporal subbands. The experimental results show that the proposed fractional-pel MAT outperforms the integer MAT and the half-pel MCOT. The gain achieved by the proposed MAT over the integer MAT can reach up to 1 dB in PSNR.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We present an image captioning framework that generates captions under a given topic. The topic candidates are extracted from the caption corpus. A given image&#x2019;s topics are then selected from these candidates by a CNN-based multi-label classifier. The input to the caption generation model is an image-topic pair, and the output is a caption of the image. For this purpose, a cross-modal embedding method is learned for the images, topics, and captions. In the proposed framework, the topic, caption, and image are organized in a hierarchical structure, which is preserved in the embedding space by using the order-embedding method. The caption embedding is upper bounded by the corresponding image embedding and lower bounded by the topic embedding. The lower bound pushes the images and captions about the same topic closer together in the embedding space. A bidirectional caption-image retrieval task is conducted on the learned embedding space and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the embedding method. To generate a caption for an image, an embedding vector is sampled from the region bounded by the embeddings of the image and the topic, then a language model decodes it to a sentence as the output. The lower bound set by the topic shrinks the output space of the language model, which may help the model to learn to match images and captions better. Experiments on the image captioning task on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets validate the usefulness of this framework by showing that the different given topics can lead to different captions describing specific aspects of the given image and that the quality of generated captions is higher than the control model without a topic as input. In addition, the proposed method is competitive with many state-of-the-art methods in terms of standard evaluation metrics.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Hypergraph learning has been widely exploited in various image processing applications, due to its advantages in modeling the high-order information. Its efficacy highly depends on building an informative hypergraph structure to accurately and robustly formulate the underlying data correlation. However, the existing hypergraph learning methods are sensitive to non-Gaussian noise, which hurts the corresponding performance. In this paper, we present a noise-resistant hypergraph learning model, which provides superior robustness against various non-Gaussian noises. In particular, our model adopts low-rank representation to construct a hypergraph, which captures the globally linear data structure as well as preserving the grouping effect of highly correlated data. We further introduce a correntropy-induced local metric to measure the reconstruction errors, which is particularly robust to non-Gaussian noises. Finally, the Frobenious-norm-based regularization is proposed to combine with the low-rank regularizer, which enables our model to regularize the singular values of the coefficient matrix. By such, the non-zero coefficients are selected to generate a hyperedge set as well as the hyperedge weights. We have evaluated the proposed hypergraph model in the tasks of image clustering and semi-supervised image classification. Quantitatively, our scheme significantly enhances the performance of the state-of-the-art hypergraph models on several benchmark data sets.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose a Group-Sparse Representation-based method with applications to Face Recognition (GSR-FR). The novel sparse representation variational model includes a non-convex sparsity-inducing penalty and a robust non-convex loss function. The penalty encourages group sparsity by using an approximation of the  $ell _{0}$ -quasinorm, and the loss function is chosen to make the algorithm robust to noise, occlusions, and disguises. The solution of the non-trivial non-convex optimization problem is efficiently obtained by a majorization-minimization strategy combined with forward-backward splitting, which, in particular, reduces the solution to a sequence of easier convex optimization sub-problems. Extensive experiments on widely used face databases show the potentiality of the proposed model and demonstrate that the GSR-FR algorithm is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods based on sparse representation, especially for very low dimensional feature spaces.

In this paper, we propose a complexity control method in the high-efficiency video coding intracoding to facilitate these video applications. The proposed method is performed on the coding tree unit&#x00a0;(CTU) level, which consists of three steps, namely complexity estimation, complexity allocation, and prediction unit&#x00a0;(PU) adaption. In the first step, a complexity estimation model is proposed to estimate the coding complexity of each CTU based on the sum of absolute transformed difference. Then, the complexity budget is allocated to each CTU proportionally to its estimated coding complexity. In PU adaption, only a subset of PU sizes are selected for the CTU according to its allocated complexity and prediction performance. A feedback-based error elimination scheme removes the complexity error during the encoding process. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to adjust the complexity ratio from 100&#x0025; to 20&#x0025;. Meanwhile, the rate-distortion performance and complexity control accuracy of the proposed method are superior to those of the state-of-the-art methods.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Real-time multiple event analysis is important for reliable situational awareness and secure operation of the power system. Multiple sequential events can induce complex superimposed pattern in the data and are challenging to analyze in real time. This paper proposes a method for accurate detection, temporal localization, and classification of multiple events in real time using synchrophasor data. For detection and temporal localization, a Teager&#x2013;Kaiser energy operator (TKEO) based method is proposed. For event classification, a time series classification based method using energy similarity measure (ESM) is proposed. The proposed method is tested for simulated multiple event cases in the IEEE-118 bus system using DigSilent/PowerFactory and real PMU data for the Indian grid.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a stochastic representation of maximized mutual information analysis (MIA) method for quality monitoring in which a manner of imposing prior probability distributions over projection parameters is employed and subsequently, a Bayesian estimation algorithm is put forward for projection learning. The proposed stochastic MIA (SMIA) based approach allows the enhanced performance of fault detection due to the following advantages over classic monitoring methods. First, the SMIA approach utilizes the mechanism of hierarchical priors and an individual prior over each projection direction, as a key feature of the proposed method, which enables SMIA to build a sparse model that can discard irrelevant components in the process data with respect to the prediction of quality variables. Second, the proposed SMIA method incorporates the advantage of maximizing mutual information on the minimum achievable error of model prediction as well as the advantage of describing the serial dynamics. Additionally, the optimal dimensionality of the latent space in an SMIA can be automatically determined during the procedure of Bayesian estimation by the utilization of these adaptive priors over projections. The effectiveness of the proposed approach for quality monitoring is demonstrated on the benchmark of Tennessee Eastman process.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we consider false data injection (FDI) attacks with limited information of transmission-line susceptances and new countermeasures in smart grids. First, we prove that the adversary could launch FDI attacks to modify the state variable on a bus or superbus only if he/she knows the susceptance of every transmission line that is incident to that bus or superbus. Based on this observation, we provide a new countermeasure against FDI attacks, i.e., to make the susceptances of $n-1$ interconnected transmission lines that cover all buses unknown to the adversary (e.g., by proactively perturbing transmission-line susceptances through distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) devices), where $n$ is the total number of buses. This new countermeasure can work alone or in conjunction with traditional ones to reduce the number of meter measurements/state variables that are to be secured against FDI attacks. The implementation of FDI attacks with limited susceptance information and the effectiveness of new countermeasures are demonstrated by using an illustrative 4-bus power system and the IEEE 9-bus, 14-bus, 30-bus, 118-bus, and 300-bus test power systems.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents the framework of a power-dispatching automation system (PDAS) based on a virtual private cloud, which extracts advantages of technologies, such as a virtual private cloud, a virtual private network, an https protocol, etc. Unlike existing on-premise or public cloud hosted PDASs that are vulnerable and may be subject to blackouts due to extreme conditions, such as natural disasters or cyberattacks, the proposed framework operates more safely and securely under those conditions, while at the same time meeting the reliability requirements for power systems as well. This paper presents the theory, architectural design, characteristics, and implementation process of the system, as well as its reliability and cyber security measurements. The annual failure time of the proposed system is reduced from 61.2 to about 0.43 min, about 142 times less than those of existing PDASs. This framework has been implemented in the Lipu power system in China since May 2016. Results show that the proposed system is reliable, safe, and cost-effective, with a bright prospect for future applications.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this work, the design of a novel the flexure-linked dual-drive H-gantry is first introduced. Compared to conventional stacked X&#x2013;Y tables, the advantages of this gantry are on decoupled X&#x2013;Y actuation, better mechanical reliability, larger driving force, and shorter response time. However, after deriving its reduced-order dynamical model, it is found that the precision of the end-effector is significantly affected by the position dependent torque caused by the inter-parallel-axes driving forces on the fixed inertia frame and coupling forces from the pair of flexures. These form barriers that limit precision positioning and tracking performance over a large workspace. Thus, in the following part, a robust integral of signum of error (RISE) control with novel jerk adaptation is proposed on top of the standard proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and feedforward scheme. Compared with some prior RISE schemes with gain adaptation, the proposed scheme yields bounded robust gain in the presence of noisy velocity estimation. Real-time experiments on the actual testbed indicate that both improvement of motion precision and prevention of resonant mode excitation over a large workspace are successfully achieved in the proposed scheme.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Despite the recent advances on intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings, existing research works mostly assume training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution. However, due to variation of operating condition, domain shift phenomenon generally exists, which results in significant diagnosis performance deterioration. To address cross-domain problems, latest research works preferably apply domain adaptation techniques on marginal data distributions. However, it is usually assumed that sufficient testing data are available for training, that is not in accordance with most transfer tasks in real industries where only data in machine healthy condition can be collected in advance. This paper proposes a novel cross-domain fault diagnosis method based on deep generative neural networks. By artificially generating fake samples for domain adaptation, the proposed method is able to provide reliable cross-domain diagnosis results when testing data in machine fault conditions are not available for training. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method offers a promising approach for industrial applications.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Accurate estimation of power capacity is critical to ensure battery safety margins and optimize energy utilization. Power capacity estimators based on online identified equivalent circuit model have been widely investigated due to the high accuracy and affordable computing cost. However, the impact of noise corruption which is common in practice on such estimators has never been investigated. This paper scrutinizes the effect of noises on model identification, state of charge (SOC) and power capacity estimation. An online model identification method based on adaptive forgetting recursive total least squares (AF-RTLS) is proposed to compensate the noise effect and attenuate the identification bias of model parameters. A Luenberger observer is further used in combination with the AF-RTLS to estimate the SOC in real time. Leveraging the estimated model parameters and SOC, a multiconstraint analytical method is proposed to online estimate the power capacity. Simulation and experimental results verify that the proposed method is superior in terms of estimation accuracy and the robustness to noise corruption.
