<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The Editors (Nov 17, 2018, p 2139)1 identified vaccine hesitancy as an important barrier to achieving the 2020 targets for immunisation. Hesitation and resistance to vaccination is a substantial issue in some districts of Kerala, India. In the Malappuram district of Kerala, which has a substantial Muslim population, we found that factors such as religion have only a minor role in resistance to vaccination (unpublished findings). Many religious leaders openly support vaccination drives and consider that religious texts and beliefs do not oppose disease prevention.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In real-world applications, different kinds of learning and prediction errors are likely to incur different costs for the same system. Moreover, in practice, the cost label information is often available only for a few training samples. In a semi-supervised setting, label propagation is critical to infer the cost information for unlabeled training data. The existing methods typically conduct label propagation independently ahead of supervised cost-sensitive learning. The precomputed label information is kept fixed, which may become suboptimal in the subsequent learning process and hence degrade the overall system performance. In this paper, we develop a unified cost-sensitive framework for semi-supervised face recognition that can jointly optimize the inferred label information and the classifier in an iterative manner. Our experiments on face benchmark datasets demonstrate that in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods for label propagation and cost-sensitive learning, the proposed approach can significantly improve the overall system performance, especially in terms of classification errors associated with high costs.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Digital reconstruction of mechanically shredded documents has received increasing attention in the last years mainly for historical and forensics needs. Computational methods to solve this problem are highly desirable in order to mitigate the time-consuming human effort and to preserve document integrity. The reconstruction of strips-shredded documents is accomplished by horizontally splicing pieces so that the arising sequence (solution) is as similar as the original document. In this context, a central issue is the quantification of the fitting between the pieces (strips), which generally involves stating a function that associates a pair of strips to a real value indicating the fitting quality. This problem is also more challenging for text documents, such as business letters or legal documents, since they depict poor color information. The system proposed here addresses this issue by exploring character shapes as visual features for compatibility computation. Experiments conducted with real mechanically shredded documents showed that our approach outperformed in accuracy other popular techniques in the literature considering documents with (almost) only textual content.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Video summarization is a challenging task, mainly due to the difficulties in learning complicated semantic structural relations between videos and summaries. In this paper, we present a novel supervised video summarization scheme based on three-stage deep neural networks. The scheme takes a divide-and-conquer strategy to resolve the complicated task of 3D video summarization into a set of easy and flexible computational subtasks, and then to sequentially perform 2D CNNs, 1D CNNs, and long short-term memory to address the subtasks in an hierarchical fashion. The hierarchical modeling of spatio&#x2013;temporal structure leads to high performance and efficiency. In addition, we propose a simple but effective user-ranking method to cope with the labeling subjectivity problem of user-created video summarization, leading to the labeling quality refinement for robust supervised learning. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art video summarization methods on two benchmark datasets.

<p>An OU-led project is showing how citizen science programs provide valuable data on rivers in southwestern United States. The ecological and hydrological data obtained from intermittent rivers (rivers that dry at some point in space or time) in Arizona are input into a nationwide network. Trained citizen scientists are mapping three rivers in Arizona: the San Pedro River, Cienega Creek and Agua Fria River.

<p>Kawasaki disease is an acute childhood vasculitis that causes coronary artery aneurysms and is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in high-income countries.1 The cause is not known and, hence, the diagnosis and treatment remain empirical and prevention is not possible. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) continues to be the mainstay of acute treatment, reducing the risk of aneurysms from about 25% to 4%. However, around 20% of patients do not respond to initial treatment with IVIG, variably increasing the risk of aneurysms.

<p>The concept of smart metering allows real-time measurement of power demand which in turn is expected to result in more efficient energy use and better load balancing. However, finely granular measurements reported by smart meters can lead to starkly increased exposure of sensitive information, including various personal attributes and activities. Even though several security solutions have been proposed in recent years to address this issue, most of the existing solutions are based on public-key cryptographic primitives, such as homomorphic encryption and elliptic curve digital signature algorithms which are ill-suited for the resource constrained smart meters. On the other hand, to address the computational inefficiency issue, some masking-based solutions have been proposed. However, these schemes cannot ensure some of the imperative security properties, such as consumer's privacy and sender authentication. In this paper, we first propose a lightweight and privacy-friendly masking-based spatial data aggregation scheme for secure forecasting of power demand in smart grids. Our scheme only uses lightweight cryptographic primitives, such as hash functions and exclusive-OR operations. Subsequently, we propose a secure billing solution for smart grids. As compared with existing solutions, our scheme is simple and can ensure better privacy protection and computational efficiency, which are essential for smart grids.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Despite the benefits of cyber-insurance, organizations are reluctant to enroll in such policies mainly because of their limitation and high price. On the other hand, insurers are confronting the adverse selection and moral hazard problems as monitoring and distinguishing insureds' cybersecurity posture are highly complicated. Considering the organizations' security interdependency and their demand for cyber-insurance, we study the design of coalitional insurance mechanisms with the goal of covering the adverse selection, moral hazard, and motivating players for cybersecurity investment and information sharing. To this end, we propose a synergistic insurance framework, where organizations collaboratively insure a common platform instead of themselves. We present three models for insuring a common platform. In the first model, organizations act as both insurer and insured to distribute the risk in the coalition. In the second model, the system provides rewards to crowdfund the insurance. Finally, in the third model, we investigate the outsourcing of a common platform insurance. Furthermore, we discuss how our proposed mechanisms for such framework satisfy the budget balanced, ex ante individual rationality, and incentive compatibility properties. We study how such a system can improve the social welfare by leveraging cyber-insurance as a motivation for organizations to cooperate on the cybersecurity investment and information sharing.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel bilinear projections model for unsupervised learning, which can be directly applied to dimension reduction and feature extraction for image analysis. Compared to previous 2-dimensional (2D) methods, our method seeks multiple rank- $k$  bilinear projections (MRBP), which makes a balance between two opposite problems of enhancing the degree of freedom and avoiding the problem of over-fitting by adjusting  $k$ . Besides, each renewed feature in our method is extracted independently, rather than dimensions reduced by row or column like before, and thus our reduced dimension is not restricted by the size of a sample. In addition, we demonstrate that our model could be optimized via two equivalent optimization problems based on the criteria of maximum separability and nearest reconstruction respectively. Motivated by this, the corresponding robust version (RMRBP) achieving a better performance to occluded data is introduced as well. Extensive experiments on several datasets have been done to verify the effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fault detection and diagnosis in the pumping unit is a challenging industrial problem for the system that exhibits nonlinearity, coupled parameters, and time-varying noise. This paper proposes a novel combined unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and radial basis function (RBF) method based on an adaptive noise factor for fault diagnosis in the pumping unit. First, to reduce computation and complexity of the diagnosis model, the Fourier descriptor method based on an approximate polygon is presented to extract the features of the indicator diagram. RBF neural network is adopted to establish the fault diagnosis model based on indicator diagram data and production data. In particular, UKF is used to train the weights ($w_{m,l}$), the center ($c_{m}$), and the width ($b_{m}$) of the RBF model. Furthermore, the adaptive noise factor method is proposed to address the adaptive filtering issue in the fault diagnosis model. The proposed method is applied to the pumping unit system, and experimental results show the effectiveness and favorable recognition rate in classifying multiple faults.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A large number of industrial video applications are expected to work in real-time and power-constrained scenarios. For such applications, the coding complexity has a great impact on their performance. In this paper, we propose a complexity control method in the high-efficiency video coding intracoding to facilitate these video applications. The proposed method is performed on the coding tree unit&#x00a0;(CTU) level, which consists of three steps, namely complexity estimation, complexity allocation, and prediction unit&#x00a0;(PU) adaption. In the first step, a complexity estimation model is proposed to estimate the coding complexity of each CTU based on the sum of absolute transformed difference. Then, the complexity budget is allocated to each CTU proportionally to its estimated coding complexity. In PU adaption, only a subset of PU sizes are selected for the CTU according to its allocated complexity and prediction performance. A feedback-based error elimination scheme removes the complexity error during the encoding process. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to adjust the complexity ratio from 100&#x0025; to 20&#x0025;. Meanwhile, the rate-distortion performance and complexity control accuracy of the proposed method are superior to those of the state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Real-time multiple event analysis is important for reliable situational awareness and secure operation of the power system. Multiple sequential events can induce complex superimposed pattern in the data and are challenging to analyze in real time. This paper proposes a method for accurate detection, temporal localization, and classification of multiple events in real time using synchrophasor data. For detection and temporal localization, a Teager&#x2013;Kaiser energy operator (TKEO) based method is proposed. For event classification, a time series classification based method using energy similarity measure (ESM) is proposed. The proposed method is tested for simulated multiple event cases in the IEEE-118 bus system using DigSilent/PowerFactory and real PMU data for the Indian grid.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we consider false data injection (FDI) attacks with limited information of transmission-line susceptances and new countermeasures in smart grids. First, we prove that the adversary could launch FDI attacks to modify the state variable on a bus or superbus only if he/she knows the susceptance of every transmission line that is incident to that bus or superbus. Based on this observation, we provide a new countermeasure against FDI attacks, i.e., to make the susceptances of $n-1$ interconnected transmission lines that cover all buses unknown to the adversary (e.g., by proactively perturbing transmission-line susceptances through distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) devices), where $n$ is the total number of buses. This new countermeasure can work alone or in conjunction with traditional ones to reduce the number of meter measurements/state variables that are to be secured against FDI attacks. The implementation of FDI attacks with limited susceptance information and the effectiveness of new countermeasures are demonstrated by using an illustrative 4-bus power system and the IEEE 9-bus, 14-bus, 30-bus, 118-bus, and 300-bus test power systems.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this work, the design of a novel the flexure-linked dual-drive H-gantry is first introduced. Compared to conventional stacked X&#x2013;Y tables, the advantages of this gantry are on decoupled X&#x2013;Y actuation, better mechanical reliability, larger driving force, and shorter response time. However, after deriving its reduced-order dynamical model, it is found that the precision of the end-effector is significantly affected by the position dependent torque caused by the inter-parallel-axes driving forces on the fixed inertia frame and coupling forces from the pair of flexures. These form barriers that limit precision positioning and tracking performance over a large workspace. Thus, in the following part, a robust integral of signum of error (RISE) control with novel jerk adaptation is proposed on top of the standard proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and feedforward scheme. Compared with some prior RISE schemes with gain adaptation, the proposed scheme yields bounded robust gain in the presence of noisy velocity estimation. Real-time experiments on the actual testbed indicate that both improvement of motion precision and prevention of resonant mode excitation over a large workspace are successfully achieved in the proposed scheme.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Despite the recent advances on intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings, existing research works mostly assume training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution. However, due to variation of operating condition, domain shift phenomenon generally exists, which results in significant diagnosis performance deterioration. To address cross-domain problems, latest research works preferably apply domain adaptation techniques on marginal data distributions. However, it is usually assumed that sufficient testing data are available for training, that is not in accordance with most transfer tasks in real industries where only data in machine healthy condition can be collected in advance. This paper proposes a novel cross-domain fault diagnosis method based on deep generative neural networks. By artificially generating fake samples for domain adaptation, the proposed method is able to provide reliable cross-domain diagnosis results when testing data in machine fault conditions are not available for training. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method offers a promising approach for industrial applications.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Accurate estimation of power capacity is critical to ensure battery safety margins and optimize energy utilization. Power capacity estimators based on online identified equivalent circuit model have been widely investigated due to the high accuracy and affordable computing cost. However, the impact of noise corruption which is common in practice on such estimators has never been investigated. This paper scrutinizes the effect of noises on model identification, state of charge (SOC) and power capacity estimation. An online model identification method based on adaptive forgetting recursive total least squares (AF-RTLS) is proposed to compensate the noise effect and attenuate the identification bias of model parameters. A Luenberger observer is further used in combination with the AF-RTLS to estimate the SOC in real time. Leveraging the estimated model parameters and SOC, a multiconstraint analytical method is proposed to online estimate the power capacity. Simulation and experimental results verify that the proposed method is superior in terms of estimation accuracy and the robustness to noise corruption.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) botnets have become one of the major threats in network security for serving as the fundamental infrastructure for various cyber-crimes. More challenges are involved in the problem of detecting P2P botnets, despite a few work claimed to detect centralized botnets effectively. We propose an enhanced PeerHunter, a network-flow level community behavior analysis based system, to detect P2P botnets. Our system starts from a P2P network flow detection component. Then, it uses &#x201c;mutual contacts&#x201d; to cluster bots into communities. Finally, it uses network-flow level community behavior analysis to detect potential botnets. In the experimental evaluation, we propose two evasion attacks, where we assume the adversaries know our techniques in advance and attempt to evade our system by making the P2P bots mimic the behavior of legitimate P2P applications. Our results showed that enhanced PeerHunter can obtain high detection rate with few false positives, and high robustness against the proposed attacks.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Using multi-atlas registration (MAR), information carried by atlases can be transferred onto a new input image for the tasks of region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation, anatomical landmark detection, and so on. Conventional atlases used in MAR methods are monomodal and contain only normal anatomical structures. Therefore, the majority of MAR methods cannot handle input multimodal pathological images, which are often collected in routine image-based diagnosis. This is because registering monomodal atlases with normal appearances to multimodal pathological images involves two major problems: 1) missing imaging modalities in the monomodal atlases and 2) influence from pathological regions. In this paper, we propose a new MAR framework to tackle these problems. In this framework, deep learning-based image synthesizers are applied for synthesizing multimodal normal atlases from conventional monomodal normal atlases. To reduce the influence from pathological regions, we further propose a multimodal low-rank approach to recover multimodal normal-looking images from multimodal pathological images. Finally, the multimodal normal atlases can be registered to the recovered multimodal images in a multi-channel way. We evaluate our MAR framework via brain ROI segmentation of multimodal tumor brain images. Due to the utilization of multimodal information and the reduced influence from pathological regions, experimental results show that registration based on our method is more accurate and robust, leading to significantly improved brain ROI segmentation compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Stereoscopic saliency detection plays an important role in various stereoscopic video processing applications. However, conventional stereoscopic video saliency detection methods mainly use independent low-level features instead of extracting them automatically, and thus, they ignore the intrinsic relationship between the spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel stereoscopic video saliency detection method based on 3D convolutional neural networks, namely, deep 3D video saliency (Deep3DSaliency). The proposed network consists of two sub-models: spatiotemporal saliency model (STSM) and stereoscopic saliency aware model (SSAM). STSM directly takes three consecutive video frames as the input to extract visual spatiotemporal features, while SSAM attempts to further infer the depth and semantic features from the left and right video frames by shared parameters from STSM. The visual spatiotemporal features from STSM and the depth and semantic features from SSAM are learned by an alternating optimization scheme. Finally, all these saliency-related features are combined together for the final stereoscopic saliency detection via 3D deconvolution. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed model over other existing ones in saliency estimation for 3D video sequences.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Traditional image quality assessment (IQA) methods do not perform robustly due to the shallow hand-designed features. It has been demonstrated that deep neural network can learn more effective features than ever. In this paper, we describe a new deep neural network to predict the image quality accurately without relying on the reference image. To learn more effective feature representations for non-reference IQA, we propose a two-stream convolution network that includes two subcomponents for image and gradient image. The motivation for this design is using a two-stream scheme to capture different-level information of inputs and easing the difficulty of extracting features from one steam. The gradient stream focuses on extracting structure features in details, and the image stream pays more attention to the information in intensity. In addition, to consider the locally non-uniform distribution of distortion in images, we add a region-based fully convolutional layer for using the information around the center of the input image patch. The final score of the overall image is calculated by averaging of the patch scores. The proposed network performs in an end-to-end manner in both the training and testing phases. The experimental results on a series of benchmark datasets, e.g., LIVE, CISQ, IVC, TID2013, and Waterloo Exploration Database, show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which verifies the effectiveness of our network architecture.
