<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Core-loss calculation is an important issue in the design and analysis of electric machines, especially in high-speed applications. However, because of the severe uneven distribution and local supersaturation of the flux density, in combination with the evident dc magnetic bias and the skin effect of the eddy current at a high frequency, it is difficult to estimate the core loss in a high-speed doubly salient electromagnetic machine. In this paper, two improved core-loss calculation methods are proposed. Additionally, an approach is established to determine the core-loss coefficients, which considers the influence of the frequency and amplitude of the flux density by adopting the function-fitting method. The change pattern of the core-loss coefficients is also investigated, together with the influence of the dc magnetic bias on the eddy-current loss. Finally, rotor-lock experiments and high-speed rotating experiments are both conducted. Additionally, two improved methods are used and compared for core-loss calculation.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel flux reversal permanent magnet (FRPM) machine with asymmetric-stator-pole (ASP) configuration. Different from the conventional FRPM machine with uniform &#x201c;NS-NS-NS&#x201d; PM sequence, the proposed ASP-FRPM machine is characterized by a &#x201c;NSN-S-NSN&#x201d; magnet arrangement. Hence, the interpolar flux leakage is significantly reduced with the developed design, which can improve the torque capability. The machine topologies, features, and operating principle are introduced, respectively. A simplified magnetic circuit model is established to reveal the underlying flux leakage reduction mechanism of the ASP design, and the rotor pole number is analytically optimized as well. The design parameters are then globally optimized so as to improve the torque quality. In addition, the electromagnetic characteristics of the ASP- and conventional FRPM machines are compared. Finally, experiments have been carried out to validate the theoretical results.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Human haptic perception system is complex, involving both cutaneous and kinesthetic receptors. These receptors work together and enable human to perceive the external world. To simulate immersive interaction with virtual objects in virtual reality scenarios haptic devices are desired to reproduce multiproperties of virtual objects, support multigestures of human hands to perform fine manipulation, produce haptic stimuli for simultaneously stimulating multireceptors (including cutaneous and kinesthetic receptors) of human haptic channel, and thus invoke realistic compound haptic sensations. In recent years, such multimodal haptic devices have emerged. In this paper, we survey the latest progress on multimodal haptic devices, identify the gaps, and put forward future research directions on the topic.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a cable-driven exoskeleton device is developed for stroke patients to enable them to perform passive range of motion exercises and teleoperation rehabilitation of their impaired hands. Each exoskeleton finger is controlled by an actuator via two cables. The motions between the metacarpophalangeal and distal&#x002f;proximal interphalangeal joints are decoupled, through which the movement pattern is analogous to that observed in the human hand. A dynamic model based on the Lagrange method is derived to estimate how cable tension varies with the angular position of the finger joints. Two discernable phases are observed, each of which reflects the motion of the metacarpophalangeal and distal&#x002f;proximal interphalangeal joints. The tension profiles of exoskeleton fingers predicted by the Lagrange model are verified through a mechatronic integrated platform. The model can precisely estimate the tensions at different movement velocities, and it shows that the characteristics of two independent phases remain the same even for a variety of movement velocities. The feasibility for measuring resistance when manipulating a patient&#x0027;s finger is demonstrated in human experiments. Specifically, the net force required to move a subject&#x0027;s finger joints can be accounted for by the Lagrange model.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Oriented-plane curvature reproduction, the control of fingertip deformation by orientating a flat plate on contact points to generate a sensation of curvature, is one of the curvature reproduction methods with favorable effects. However, among the three geometric cues of curvature, only the zeroth- and first-order information is recovered with this method, whereas the second-order information (i.e., local curvature) is neglected due to the oriented plate&#x0027;s inherent characteristic of having a planar surface. The second-order information will change the contact length between the finger and the surface and thus affects the feeling. As a solution for this problem, this paper proposes to control the indentation depth of the finger pulp on the oriented plate such that the correct contact length is reproduced during the rendering. A finger wearable device is developed to control that indentation depth. Three psychophysical experiments are carried out and the results indicate that the second-order information plays a positive role in curvature rendering.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Unpaired image-to-image translation problem aims to model the mapping from one domain to another with unpaired training data. Current works like the well-acknowledged Cycle GAN provide a general solution for any two domains through modeling injective mappings with a symmetric structure. While in situations where two domains are asymmetric in complexity, i.e., the amount of information between two domains is different, these approaches pose problems of poor generation quality, mapping ambiguity, and model sensitivity. To address these issues, we propose Asymmetric GAN (AsymGAN) to adapt the asymmetric domains by introducing an auxiliary variable (aux) to learn the extra information for transferring from the information-poor domain to the information-rich domain, which improves the performance of state-of-the-art approaches in the following ways. First, aux better balances the information between two domains which benefits the quality of generation. Second, the imbalance of information commonly leads to mapping ambiguity, where we are able to model one-to-many mappings by tuning aux, and furthermore, our aux is controllable. Third, the training of Cycle GAN can easily make the generator pair sensitive to small disturbances and variations while our model decouples the ill-conditioned relevance of generators by injecting aux during training. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed method both qualitatively and quantitatively on asymmetric situation, label-photo task, on Cityscapes and Helen datasets, and show many applications of asymmetric image translations. In conclusion, our AsymGAN provides a better solution for unpaired image-to-image translation in asymmetric domains.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we focus on restoring high-resolution facial images under noisy low-resolution scenarios. This problem is a challenging problem as the most important structures and details of captured facial images are missing. To address this problem, we propose a novel local patch-based face super-resolution (FSR) method via the joint learning of the contextual model. The contextual model is based on the topology consisting of contextual sub-patches, which provide more useful structural information than the commonly used local contextual structures due to the finer patch size. In this way, the contextual models are able to recover the missing local structures in target patches. In order to further strengthen the structural compensation function of contextual topology, we introduce the recognition feature as additional regularity. Based on the contextual model, we formulate the super-resolved procedure as a contextual joint representation with respect to the target patch and its adjacent patches. The high-resolution image is obtained by weighting contextual estimations. Both quantitative and qualitative validations show that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Open-ended long-form video question answering is a challenging task in visual information retrieval, which automatically generates a natural language answer from the referenced long-form video contents according to a given question. However, the existing works mainly focus on short-form video question answering, due to the lack of modeling semantic representations from long-form video contents. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic hierarchical reinforced network for open-ended long-form video question answering, which employs an encoder&#x2013;decoder architecture with a dynamic hierarchical encoder and a reinforced decoder. Concretely, we first propose a frame-level dynamic long-short term memory (LSTM) network with binary segmentation gate to learn frame-level semantic representations according to the given question. We then develop a segment-level highway LSTM network with a question-aware highway gate for segment-level semantic modeling. Furthermore, we devise the reinforced decoder with a hierarchical attention mechanism to generate natural language answers. We construct a large-scale long-form video question answering dataset. The extensive experiments on the long-form dataset and another public short-form dataset show the effectiveness of our method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Cross-modal retrieval is an important research area due to its wide range of applications, and several algorithms have been proposed to address this task. We feel that it is the right time to take a step back and analyze the current status of research in this area. As new object classes are continuously being discovered over time, it is necessary to design algorithms that can generalize to data from previously unseen classes. Towards that goal, our first contribution is to establish protocols for generalized zero-shot cross-modal retrieval and analyze the generalization ability of the standard cross-modal algorithms. Second, we propose a semantic-aware ranking algorithm that can be used as an add-on to any existing cross-modal approach to improve its performance on both seen and unseen classes. Finally, we propose a modification of the standard evaluation metric (MAP for single-label data and NDCG for multi-label data), which we feel is a more intuitive measure of the cross-modal retrieval performance. Extensive experiments on two single-label and three multi-label cross-modal datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A novel thermal infrared pedestrian segmentation algorithm based on conditional generative adversarial network (IPS-cGAN) is proposed for intelligent vehicular applications. The convolution backbone architecture of the generator is based on the improved U-Net with residual blocks for well utilizing regional semantic information. Moreover, cross entropy loss for segmentation is introduced as the condition for the generator. SandwichNet, a novel convolutional network with symmetrical input, is proposed as the discriminator for real&#x2013;fake segmented images. Based on the c-GAN framework, good segmentation performance could be achieved for thermal infrared pedestrians. Compared to some supervised and unsupervised segmentation algorithms, the proposed algorithm achieves higher accuracy with better robustness, especially for complex scenes.

<p>Standard security protocols like SSL, TLS, IPSec etc. have high memory and
processor consumption which makes all these security protocols unsuitable for
resource constrained platforms such as Internet of Things (IoT). Blockchain
(BC) finds its efficient application in IoT platform to preserve the five basic
cryptographic primitives, such as confidentiality, authenticity, integrity,
availability and non-repudiation. Conventional adoption of BC in IoT platform
causes high energy consumption, delay and computational overhead which are not
appropriate for various resource constrained IoT devices. This work proposes a
machine learning (ML) based smart access control framework in a public and a
private BC for a smart city application which makes it more efficient as
compared to the existing IoT applications. The proposed IoT based smart city
architecture adopts BC technology for preserving all the cryptographic security
and privacy issues. Moreover, BC has very minimal overhead on IoT platform as
well. This work investigates the existing threat models and critical access
control issues which handle multiple permissions of various nodes and detects
relevant inconsistencies to notify the corresponding nodes. Comparison in terms
of all security issues with existing literature shows that the proposed
architecture is competitively efficient in terms of security access control.

<p>An important concern for many Cloud customers is data confidentiality. Of
particular concern are potential data leaks via side channels, which arise when
mutually untrusted parties contend on resources such as CPUs, caches, and
networks. In this paper, we present a principled solution for mitigating side
channels that arise from shared network links. Our solution, Pacer, shapes the
outbound traffic of a Cloud tenant to make it independent of the tenant's
secrets by design. At the same time, Pacer permits traffic variations based on
public (non-secret) aspects of the tenants' computation, thus enabling
efficient sharing of network resources. Implementing Pacer requires modest
changes to the guest OS and the hosting hypervisor, and only minimal changes to
guest applications. Experiments show that Pacer allows guests to protect their
secrets with overhead close to the minimum possible considering the guest's
conditional traffic distribution given public information. For instance, Pacer
can hide a requested Wiktionary document in one of two size clusters at an
average throughput and bandwidth overhead of 6.8% and 150%, respectively.

<p>Blockchain interoperability, which allows state transitions across different
blockchain networks, is critical functionality to facilitate major blockchain
adoption. Existing interoperability protocols mostly focus on atomic token
exchange between blockchains. However, as blockchains have been upgraded from
passive distributed ledgers into programmable state machines (thanks to smart
contracts), the scope of blockchain interoperability goes beyond just token
exchange. In this paper, we present HyperService, the first platform that
delivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains.
HyperService is powered by two innovative designs: (i) a developer-facing
programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain applications
in a unified programming model; and (ii) a secure blockchain-facing
cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains.
We implement a prototype of HyperService in about 35,000 lines of code to

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In Reply Dr Yang and colleagues highlight some of the key challenges facing the field of biomarker discovery in general and in particular with the use of PD-L1 metrics to predict immunotherapy response in NSCLC. We agree that there are numerous challenges to interpreting PD-L1 pathological data, including the antibody clone used, intensity of staining, heterogeneity of expression within the tumor, and changes in expression over time and with interval treatments. Ultimately, controlling for all of these variables, even in the context of a clinical trial (eg, requiring evaluation of PD-L1 status from multiple biopsy sites), is very challenging and further highlights the importance of exploring these data in a real-world data set where community clinical practice precludes optimization of all of these parameters. Nevertheless, as noted in the Methods section of the article, we defined positive and negative PD-L1 results using previously published standards, including a requirement of 50% staining in a central laboratory using the 22C3 or SP142 antibodies, or annotation in the medical record of a positive result. Cases that did not adhere to these guidelines were excluded.

<p>Neuroblastoma, a malignancy of the sympathetic nervous system that arises in cells derived from the neural crest, predominantly affects young children. Although survival rates have improved significantly, neuroblastoma remains challenging due, in part, to its biological and clinical heterogeneity. Subsets of children fare well with minimal therapy, with cure rates of close to 100% for children with specific disease characteristics; however, for high-risk patients the cure rates are&#8201;approximately&#8201;50%. Current risk stratification systems consider patient age and stage as well as tumor histology and genomic features, permitting delivery of therapy that is based on the likelihood of disease recurrence. Only observation is required for some patients, whereas for other patients, maximally intensive multimodality therapy is necessary.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A significant portion (ca. 40%) of the world's total energy is utilized in buildings. Cooling of large buildings worldwide is done by centrifugal chiller systems, where the compressors, pumps, and fans are driven by ac motors. These motors are energy hungry parts of the chiller. All-variable speed chillers, taking into account load variations, reduced the energy demand significantly compared to the constant speed ones. Induction motors (IMs) are commonly used in modern chillers. However, as the efficiency of the IM decreases with the speed, the overall efficiency drops, as the chiller operates most of the time in part-load condition. In this paper, SimulationX software is used to quantitatively investigate about the energy efficiency improvement by using synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) in all-variable speed centrifugal chillers. The system was tested for three distinct building load profiles. The results are judged in comparison with the state-of-the-art IE2 IMs. The results provide quantitative evidence that SynRM can significantly increase the energy efficiency in the chiller systems and has a big potential to substitute IMs in these applications.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel sensor-less switching method based on logic gates for a five-level packed U-cell (PUC5) converter. It comprises only two level-shifted triangular carriers and logic gates. Hence, the number of triangular carriers is halved and the switching states table is eliminated, which cause remarkable reduction in complexity of the proposed modulation method. Moreover, employing the proposed sensor-less switching method leads to decrease in the PUC5 capacitor value by a factor of carrier ratio, fast self-balancing of the PUC5 capacitor voltage, and halving the output LC filter inductor and capacitor values in stand-alone mode, as well as the grid-link inductor value in grid-connected mode. In addition, the PUC5 converter start-up transient time is considerably decreased and the first switching harmonic cluster frequency is doubled, which lead to notable improvement of steady-state and dynamic performances of the PUC5 converter. The proposed sensor-less switching method has been implemented in both stand-alone and grid-connected operating modes of PUC5 converter. Provided simulation and experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed sensor-less switching method as well as its improved dynamic and steady-state performances in both stand-alone and grid-connected modes.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Participatory sensing is a crowdsourcing-based framework, where the platform executes the sensing requests with the help of many common peoples' handheld devices (typically smartphones). In this paper, we mainly address the online sensing request admission and smartphone selection problem to maximize the profit of the platform, taking into account the queue backlog, and the location of sensing requests and smartphones. First, we formulate this problem as a discrete time model and design a location aware online admission and selection control algorithm (LAAS) based on the Lyapunov optimization technique. The LAAS algorithm only depends on the currently available information and makes all the control decisions independently and simultaneously. Next, we utilize the recent advancement of the accurate prediction of smartphones' mobility and sensing request arrival information in the next few time slots and develop a predictive location aware admission and selection control algorithm (PLAAS). We further design a greedy predictive location aware admission and selection control algorithm (GPLAAS) to achieve the online implementation of PLAAS approximately and iteratively. Theoretical analysis shows that under any control parameter V &gt; 0, both LAAS and PLAAS algorithm can achieve O(1/V)-optimal average profit, while the sensing request backlog is bounded by O(V). Extensive numerical results based on both synthetic and real trace show that LAAS outperforms the Greedy algorithm and Random algorithm and GPLAAS improves the profit-backlog tradeoff over LAAS.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Public cloud offers economy of scale to adapt workload changes in an autonomic manner, maximizing the use of resources. Through network function virtualization (NFV), network operators can move LTE core to the cloud; hence removing their dependency on carrier-grade LTE network functions. Recent research efforts discuss performance, latency, and fault tolerance of LTE NFV, largely ignoring the security aspects. In this paper, we discover new vulnerabilities that LTE NFV face today with no standard solutions to address them. These vulnerabilities span at both LTE control and user planes. To address them, we propose vEPC-sec that cryptographically secures LTE control-plane signaling messages in the cloud. It provides distributed key management and key derivation schemes to derive shared-symmetric keys for securing the communication between any two network functions. Our approach provides encryption and integrity protection to the messages even during virtual machines scalability and failure recovery scenarios. vEPC-sec also prevents user-plane vulnerabilities by ensuring that LTE routing modules should faithfully forward the LTE subscriber packets.

<p>In many communication channels, secrecy constraints usually incur a penalty in capacity, as well as generalized degrees-of-freedom (GDoF). In this paper, we show an interesting observation that adding a helper can totally remove the penalty in sum GDoF for a two-user symmetric Gaussian interference channel. For the interference channel where each transmitter sends a message to an intended receiver without secrecy constraints, the sum GDoF is a well-known &#x201c;W&#x201d; curve, characterized by Etkin-Tse-Wang in 2008. If the secrecy constraints are imposed on this interference channel, where the message of each transmitter must be secure from the unintended receiver (eavesdropper), then a GDoF penalty is incurred and the secure sum GDoF is reduced to a modified &#x201c;W&#x201d; curve, derived by Chen recently. In this paper, we show that, by adding a helper into this interference channel with secrecy constraints, the secure sum GDoF turns out to be a &#x201c;W&#x201d; curve, which is the same as the sum GDoF of the setting without secrecy constraints. The proposed scheme is based on the cooperative jamming and a careful signal design such that the jamming signal of the helper is aligned at a specific direction and power level with the information signals of the transmitters, which allows us to totally remove the penalty in GDoF due to the secrecy constraints. Furthermore, the estimation approaches of noise removal and signal separation due to the rational independence are used in the secure rate analysis.

<p>The electroencephalography (EEG) method has recently attracted increasing attention in the study of brain activity-based biometric systems because of its simplicity, portability, noninvasiveness, and relatively low cost. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG, most of the existing EEG-based biometric systems require a long duration of signals to achieve high accuracy in individual identification. Besides, the feasibility and stability of these systems have not yet been conclusively reported, since most studies did not perform longitudinal evaluation. In this paper, we proposed a novel EEG-based individual identification method using code-modulated visualevoked potentials (c-VEPs). Specifically, this paper quantitatively compared eight code-modulated stimulation patterns, including six 63-bit (1.05 s at 60-Hz refresh rate) m-sequences (M1-M6) and two spatially combined sequence groups (M&#x00d7;4: M1-M4 and M&#x00d7; 6: M1-M6) in recording the c-VEPs from a group of 25 subjects for individual identification. To further evaluate the influence of inter-session variability, we recorded two data sessions for each individual on different days to measure intra-session and cross-session identification performance. State-of-the-art VEP detection algorithms in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) were employed to construct a template-matching-based identification framework. For intra-session identification, we achieved a 100% correct recognition rate (CRR) using 5.25-s EEG data (average of five trials for M5). For cross-session identification, 99.43% CRR was attained using 10.5-s EEG signals (average of ten trials for M5). These results suggest that the proposed c-VEP based individual identification method is promising for real-world applications.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In cyberspace, evolutionary strategies are commonly used by both attackers and defenders. For example, an attacker's strategy often changes over the course of time, as new vulnerabilities are discovered and/or mitigated. Similarly, a defender's strategy changes over time. These changes may or may not be in direct response to a change in the opponent's strategy. In any case, it is important to have a set of quantitative metrics to characterize and understand the effectiveness of attackers' and defenders' evolutionary strategies, which reflect their cyber agility. Despite its clear importance, few systematic metrics have been developed to quantify the cyber agility of attackers and defenders. In this paper, we propose the first metric framework for measuring cyber agility in terms of the effectiveness of the dynamic evolution of cyber attacks and defenses. The proposed framework is generic and applicable to transform any relevant, quantitative, and/or conventional static security metrics (e.g., false positives and false negatives) into dynamic metrics to capture dynamics of system behaviors. In order to validate the usefulness of the proposed framework, we conduct case studies on measuring the evolution of cyber attacks and defenses using two real-world datasets. We discuss the limitations of the current work and identify future research directions.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The deployment of smart hybrid heat pumps (SHHPs) can introduce considerable benefits to electricity systems via smart switching between electricity and gas while minimizing the total heating cost for each individual customer. In particular, the fully optimized control technology can provide flexible heat that redistributes the heat demand across time for improving the utilization of low-carbon generation and enhancing the overall energy efficiency of the heating system. To this end, an accurate quantification of the preheating is of great importance to characterize the flexible heat. This paper proposes a novel data-driven preheating quantification method to estimate the capability of the heat pump demand shifting and isolate the effect of interventions. Varieties of fine-grained data from a real-world trial are exploited to estimate the baseline heat demand using Bayesian deep learning while jointly considering epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. A comprehensive range of case studies are carried out to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed quantification method, and then, the estimated demand shift is used as an input into the whole-system model to investigate the system implications and quantify the range of benefits of rolling out the SHHPs developed by PassivSystems to the future GB electricity systems.

<p>Obtaining an appropriate model is very crucial to develop an efficient energy management system for the smart home, including photovoltaic (PV) array, plug-in electric vehicle (PEV), home loads, and heat pump (HP). Stochastic modeling methods of smart homes explain random parameters and uncertainties of the aforementioned components. In this paper, a concise yet comprehensive analysis and comparison are presented for these techniques. First, modeling methods are implemented to find appropriate and precise forecasting models for PV, PEV, HP, and home load demand. Then, the accuracy of each model is validated by the real measured data. Finally, the pros and cons of each method are discussed and reviewed. The obtained results show the conditions under which the methods can provide a reliable and accurate description of smart home dynamics.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>At present, the fusion of different unimodal biometrics has attracted increasing attention from researchers, who are dedicated to the practical application of biometrics. In this paper, we explored a multi-biometric algorithm that integrates palmprints and dorsal hand veins (DHV). Palmprint recognition has a rather high accuracy and reliability, and the most significant advantage of DHV recognition is the biopsy (Liveness detection). In order to combine the advantages of both and implement the fusion method, deep learning and graph matching were, respectively, introduced to identify palmprint and DHV. Upon using the deep hashing network (DHN), biometric images can be encoded as 128-bit codes. Then, the Hamming distances were used to represent the similarity of two codes. Biometric graph matching (BGM) can obtain three discriminative features for classification. In order to improve the accuracy of open-set recognition, in multi-modal fusion, the score-level fusion of DHN and BGM was performed and authentication was provided by support vector machine (SVM). Furthermore, based on DHN, all four levels of fusion strategies were used for multi-modal recognition of palmprint and DHV. Evaluation experiments and comprehensive comparisons were conducted on various commonly used datasets, and the promising results were obtained in this case where the equal error rates (EERs) of both palmprint recognition and multi-biometrics equal 0, demonstrating the great superiority of DHN in biometric verification.
