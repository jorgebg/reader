</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Researchers have developed a rapid and reliable new method to continuously monitor sickle cell disease using a microfluidics-based electrical impedance sensor. This novel technology can characterize the dynamic cell sickling and unsickling processes in sickle blood without the use of microscopic imaging or biochemical markers. The technology is being developed with the hope of providing patients with a portable, standalone sensor to conveniently self-monitor the hematological parameters of their disease and evaluate their risk of vaso-occlusion.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The so-called 'silent' or 'synonymous' genetic alterations do not result in altered proteins. But they can nevertheless influence numerous functions of the cell and thus also disease processes. Scientists from the German Cancer Consortium, German Cancer Research Center, and the University of Freiburg have now created a comprehensive database of all synonymous mutations ever found in cancer. This is a 'reference book' that provides cancer researchers with all available information on each of these supposedly 'silent' mutations at a glance.

<p>The heterogeneity of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), long recognised by clinicians, is now challenging the entire lupus community, from geneticists to clinical investigators. Although the outlook for patients with SLE has greatly improved, many unmet needs remain, chief of which is the development of safer and more efficacious therapies. To develop innovative therapies, a far better understanding of SLE pathogenesis as it relates to the array of clinical phenotypes is needed. Additionally, to efficiently achieve these goals, the lupus community needs to refine existing clinical research tools and better adapt them to overcome the obstacles created by the heterogeneity of manifestations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Existing research on vulnerability discovery models shows that the existence of vulnerabilities inside an application may be linked to certain features, e.g., size or complexity, of that application. However, the applicability of such features to demonstrate the relative security between two applications is not well studied, which may depend on multiple factors in a complex way. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale empirical study of the correlation between various features of applications and the abundance of vulnerabilities. Unlike existing work, which typically focuses on one particular application, resulting in limited successes, we focus on the more realistic issue of assessing the relative security level among different applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study of 780 real-world applications involving 6498 vulnerabilities. We apply seven feature selection methods to nine feature subsets selected among 34 collected features, which are then fed into six types of machine learning models, producing 523 estimations. The predictive power of important features is evaluated using four different performance measures. This paper reflects that the complexity of applications is not the only factor in vulnerability discovery and the human-related factors contribute to explaining the number of discovered vulnerabilities in an application.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we address the problem of forensic photo carving, which serves as one of the key sources of digital evidence in modern law enforcement. We propose efficient algorithms for assembling meaningful photographs from orphaned photofragments, carved without access to file headers, meta-data, or compression settings. The addressed problem raises a novel variant of a jigsaw puzzle with an unknown number of mixed images, missing pieces, and severe brightness and colorization artifacts. We construct an efficient compatibility metric for matching puzzle pieces and a corresponding image stitching procedure which allows us to mitigate these artifacts. To facilitate photo assembly, we perform a forensic analysis of the fragments to provide clues about their location within the frame of the imaging sensor. The proposed algorithm formulates the assembly problem as finding non-overlapping sets in an interval graph spanned over the input fragments. The algorithm exhibits lower computational complexity compared with a popular puzzle-solving approach based on minimal spanning trees.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In recent studies, a simple non-coherent communication scheme based on energy detection is proposed in massive single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems. Before data transmission, the transmitter sends pilots to the receiver for the purpose of estimating the channel statistics. However, this training phase unintentionally provides opportunity for a malicious jammer to attack legitimate communication. In order to secure the legitimate communication, this paper proposes a jamming detection method in non-coherent SIMO systems, in which the information of channel statistics is not required. First, the transmitter sends pilots to the receiver, then the receiver sends the conjugate of its received signal (which may contain jammer signal) back to the transmitter, where the final decision on jamming detection is made. According to the likelihood ratio test principle, two detectors based on variance and standard variance normalization are proposed. The performance analysis indicates that these two detectors are of similar detection performance but of different complexity. Furthermore, it is revealed that the probability of detection initially grows with the number of receive antennas but converges quickly then, whereas the channel statistics from the jammer to the receiver always greatly influences the performance. Finally, the numerical simulations are carried out to validate the proposed detection method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Currently, much attention has been paid to reversible data hiding (RDH) in an encrypted domain due to the popular deployment of cloud storage. However, nearly all existing RDH schemes in the encrypted domain are proposed for raster images, and very little work has been done to 2D vector graphics, which are represented in real numbers. In this paper, a reversible mapping model for real numbers is first built. It maps the points in  $R^{n}$  to  $2^{s}$  non-intersecting subsets in  $R^{n}$ , which guarantees that  $s$  bits can be embedded into each real number. Based on the model, an RDH scheme in encrypted 2D vector graphics is put forward. In the scheme, a user encrypts 2D engineering graphics and stores them in the cloud, and then the cloud service provider can perform information hiding, extraction, and even recover the encrypted 2D vector graphics. For the authorized user, it can acquire the recovered 2D vector graphics from the cloud and obtain their original versions after decryption. For an unauthorized user, he can only acquire the encrypted 2D vector graphics with a hidden message, and only approximate 2D vector graphics can be obtained even if he knows the decryption key but does not know the hiding key. The experimental results and analysis show that it can strike a good balance between security, distortion, and capacity. It provides a new paradigm for RDH in the encrypted domain for the data represented in real numbers.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Named data networking (NDN) is a disruptive yet promising architecture for the future Internet, in which the content diffusion mechanisms are shifted from the conventional host-centric to content-centric ones so that the data delivery can be significantly improved. After a decade of research and development, NDN and the related NDN forwarding daemon implementations are now mature enough to enable stakeholders, such as telcos, to consider them for a real deployment. Consequently, NDN and IP will likely cohabit, and the future Internet may be formed of isolated administrative domains, each deploying one of these two network paradigms. The security question of the resulting architecture naturally arises. In this paper, we consider the case of denial of service. Even though the interest flooding attack (IFA) has been largely studied and mitigated through NACK packets in pure NDN networks, we demonstrate in this paper through experimental assessments that there are still some ways to mount such an attack, and especially in the context of coupling NDN with IP, which can hardly be addressed by current solutions. Subsequently, we leverage the hypothesis testing theory to develop a generalized likelihood ratio test adapted to evolve IFA attacks. Simulations show the relevance of the proposed model for guaranteeing the prescribed probability of false alarm and highlight the trade-off between detection power and delay. Finally, we consider a real deployment scenario where NDN is coupled with IP to carry HTTP traffic. We show that the model of IFA attacks is not very accurate in practice and further develops a sequential detector to keep a high detection accuracy. By considering data from the testbed, we show the efficiency of the overall detection method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Converter-driven direct current (dc) motors exhibit various advantages in industry, but impose several challenges to higher precision speed regulation in the presence of parametric uncertainties and exogenous, time-varying load torque disturbances. In this paper, the robust predictive speed regulation problem of a generic dc&#x2013;dc buck converter-driven permanent magnet dc motors is addressed by using an output feedback discrete-time model predictive control algorithm. A new discrete-time reduced-order generalized proportional-integral observer (GPIO) is proposed to reconstruct the virtual system states as well as the lumped disturbances. The estimates of GPIO are then collected for output speed prediction. An optimized duty ratio law of the converter is obtained by solving a constrained receding horizon optimization problem, where the operational constraint on control input is explicitly taken into account. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed new algorithm is demonstrated by various experimental testing results.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the automated demand response (DR) problem in smart grids equipped with information and communication technology networks, where power generating and consuming units can exchange information as a multiagent system (MAS), and a real-time pricing (RTP) scheme is proposed. When the communication graph among agents is connected, a novel parallel and distributed consensus-based algorithm is proposed to derive an RTP scheme to facilitate DR, and when communication uncertainties exist, a robust consensus algorithm is proposed to cease the effect of uncertainties. Next, this paper proposes a novel control mechanism to tackle the problem of disconnected communication among agents, e.g., under cyber-attacks, by employing the so-called mixed communication-broadcast control architecture where the underlying ideas are twofold. First, each area in the grid associated with a connected subgraph is controlled by a MAS to guarantee the power balance and to reach consensus on the local electric price for that area. Second, a supervisory unit observes those local electric prices to calculate the global electric price for the whole grid and then broadcasts to all units so that they can properly adjust their output powers. Simulations are carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system to validate the proposed control mechanisms.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper investigates the problem of decentralized fault-tolerant tracking control for nonlinear large-scale systems with sensor and actuator faults. Due to the adverse coupling effects that unknown sensor faults and output interconnections coexist, the previous methods fail to achieve decentralized tracking controls. Focus of this paper is particularly on addressing this issue. First, a decentralized fault-tolerant observer is constructed to simultaneously estimate unmeasured state and compensate the actuator faults. Then, an adaptive signal compensation mechanism is presented to mitigate the effects of sensor faults and output interconnections. By applying the cubic absolute-value Lyapunov function analysis method, it is shown that all the signals are bounded and the tracking error of each subsystem converges to an adjustable neighborhood of zero. An example of a large-scale power system is adopted to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained scheme.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>High control bandwidth is usually restricted in a finite sampling rate of a charge-coupled device (CCD)-based tracking loop, which hinders a good closed-loop performance. Conventionally, a rate feedforward controller is usually used to improve the control performance; however, it is restricted by the line-of-sight (LOS) rate, which is required to be estimated due to only the LOS error available in the CCD-based tracking control system. Besides that, it is also affected by the inverse of the control model. A new error-based feedforward (EBF) control mode is proposed to overcome these difficulties. Due to being plugged into an existing feedback control loop, the closed-loop performance of the CCD-based control system can be minimized by optimizing a Q-filter. The closed-loop stability and robustness with this EBF control system are investigated on the condition of the gain margin and the phase margin of the open-loop transfer function. Furthermore, this paper proposes a new criterion to enhance the robustness of the EBF control system and reveals the sensitivity function property. Because of not being restricted by an accurate model, this new feedforward controller cannot lead to a compromise between error attenuation and noise propagation in the control loop. Simulations and experiments are both used to testify the effectiveness of the improved control mode.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper analyzes the neutral current reduction performance of a three-phase four-leg solid state transformer (SST) under different degrees of unbalanced load. Several kinds of control strategies are presented, such as the neutral current elimination controls that rely on phase shifting, voltage amplitude, phase shifting, and voltage amplitude combination control. A neutral current minimization control, which ensures the SST output voltages complying with the EN 50160 output voltage unbalance standard, is also developed. These control approaches simply build on the balanced voltage control providing voltage references which slightly unbalance the voltage amplitude and phase angle or both. The effectiveness of the proposed strategies is validated through tests on a downscaled prototype. Simulation results for the neutral current minimization control of the SST applied to a real urban distribution network with distributed loads are presented. The results of this analysis show that overall the neutral current minimization results in an energy saving from both reduced losses in the distribution cables and reduced power consumption in the load.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Developing methods to predict how image quality affects the task performance is a topic of great interest in many applications. While such studies have been performed in the medical imaging community, little work has been reported in the security X-ray imaging literature. In this paper, we develop models that predict the effect of image quality on the detection of the improvised explosive device components by bomb technicians in images taken using portable X-ray systems. Using a newly developed NIST-LIVE X-Ray Task Performance Database, we created a set of objective algorithms that predict bomb technician detection performance based on the measures of image quality. Our basic measures are traditional image quality indicators (IQIs) and perceptually relevant natural scene statistics (NSS)-based measures that have been extensively used in visible light image quality prediction algorithms. We show that these measures are able to quantify the perceptual severity of degradations and can predict the performance of expert bomb technicians in identifying threats. Combining NSS- and IQI-based measures yields even better task performance prediction than either of these methods independently. We also developed a new suite of statistical task prediction models that we refer to as quality inspectors of X-ray images (QUIX); we believe this is the first NSS-based model for security X-ray images. We also show that QUIX can be used to reliably predict conventional IQI metric values on the distorted X-ray images.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We consider the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging of an object using the light reflected off a diffusive wall. The wall scatters incident light such that a lens is no longer useful to form an image. Instead, we exploit the 4D spatial coherence function to reconstruct a 2D projection of the obscured object. The approach is completely passive in the sense that no control over the light illuminating the object is assumed and is compatible with the partially coherent fields ubiquitous in both the indoor and outdoor environments. We formulate a multi-criteria convex optimization problem for reconstruction, which fuses the reflected field&#x2019;s intensity and spatial coherence information at different scales. Our formulation leverages established optics models of light propagation and scattering and exploits the sparsity common to many images in different bases. We also develop an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers to efficiently solve the convex program proposed. A means for analyzing the null space of the measurement matrices is provided as well as a means for weighting the contribution of individual measurements to the reconstruction. This paper holds promise to advance passive imaging in the challenging NLOS regimes in which the intensity does not necessarily retain distinguishable features and provides a framework for multi-modal information fusion for efficient scene reconstruction.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Accurately clustering Internet-scale Internet users into multiple communities according to their aesthetic styles is a useful technique in image modeling and data mining. In this paper, we present a novel partially supervised model which seeks a sparse representation to capture photo aesthetics. It optimally fuzes multi-channel features, i.e., human gaze behavior, quality scores, and semantic tags, each of which could be absent. Afterward, by leveraging the KL-divergence to distinguish the aesthetic distributions between photo sets, a large-scale graph is constructed to describe the aesthetic correlations between users. Finally, a dense subgraph mining algorithm which intrinsically supports outliers (i.e., unique users not belong to any community) is adopted to detect aesthetic communities. The comprehensive experimental results on a million-scale image set grabbed from Flickr have demonstrated the superiority of our method. As a byproduct, the discovered aesthetic communities can enhance photo retargeting and video summarization substantially.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Intensity-based image registration approaches rely on similarity measures to guide the search for geometric correspondences with the high affinity between images. The properties of the used measures are vital for the robustness and accuracy of the registration. In this paper, a symmetric, intensity interpolation-free, affine registration framework based on a combination of intensity and spatial information is proposed. The excellent performance of the framework is demonstrated on a combination of synthetic tests, recovering known transformations in the presence of noise, and real applications in biomedical and medical image registration, for both 2D and 3D images. The method exhibits greater robustness and higher accuracy than similarity measures in common use, when inserted into a standard gradient-based registration framework available as part of the open source Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit. The method is also empirically shown to have a low computational cost, making it practical for real applications. The source code is available.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The de facto algorithm for facial landmark estimation involves running a face detector with a subsequent deformable model fitting on the bounding box. This encompasses two basic problems: 1) the detection and deformable fitting steps are performed independently, while the detector might not provide the best-suited initialization for the fitting step, and 2) the face appearance varies hugely across different poses, which makes the deformable face fitting very challenging and thus distinct models have to be used (e.g., one for profile and one for frontal faces). In this paper, we propose the first, to the best of our knowledge, joint multi-view convolutional network to handle large pose variations across faces in-the-wild, and elegantly bridge face detection and facial landmark localization tasks. The existing joint face detection and landmark localization methods focus only on a very small set of landmarks. By contrast, our method can detect and align a large number of landmarks for semi-frontal (68 landmarks) and profile (39 landmarks) faces. We evaluate our model on a plethora of datasets including the standard static image datasets such as IBUG, 300W, COFW, and the latest Menpo Benchmark for both semi-frontal and profile faces. A significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods on deformable face tracking is witnessed on the 300VW benchmark. We also demonstrate state-of-the-art results for face detection on FDDB and MALF datasets.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In order to improve the performance of fault isolation and diagnosis of principal component analysis (PCA) based methods, this article proposes a novel fault detection and isolation approach using the structured joint sparse PCA (SJSPCA). The objective function involves two regularization terms: the '2,1 norm and the graph Laplacian. By imposing the '2,1 norm, SJSPCA is able to achieve rowwise sparsity, and introducing the graph Laplacian term can incorporate structured variable correlation information. The row-sparsity property of '2,1 norm ensures that the score indices associated with normal variables approaching zero and the graph Laplacian constraint helps the isolation of correlated faulty variables. Once a fault is detected, a twostage fault-isolation strategy is considered and a score index is calculated for each variable. It is proved that the proposed two-stage strategy is capable of isolating faulty variables. The improved fault-isolation performance of SJSPCA is illustrated by a simulation example and a gas flow fault observed in an industrial blast furnace iron-making process.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Automated fault detection is an important part of a quality control system. It has the potential to increase the overall quality of monitored products and processes. The fault detection of automotive instrument cluster systems in computer-based manufacturing assembly lines is currently limited to simple boundary checking. The analysis of more complex nonlinear signals is performed manually by trained operators, whose knowledge is used to supervise quality checking and manual detection of faults. We present a novel approach for automated Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) based on deep learning. The approach was tested on data generated by computer-based manufacturing systems equipped with local and remote sensing devices. The results show that the approach models the different spatial/temporal patterns found in the data. The approach can successfully diagnose and locate multiple classes of faults under real-time working conditions. The proposed method is shown to outperform other established FDI methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents the topology, analysis, and control implementation of a new single-phase flexible power quality conditioner (FPQC), which can be used for handling voltage- and current-related power quality (PQ) problems. Different from other PQ-compensating devices, the FPQC can work under two compensating modes, i.e., parallel-connection mode (PCM) and series-connection mode (SCM). When the source voltage is unpolluted, the FPQC is working under the PCM so that the load harmonic current and reactive power can be compensated. When the source voltage is polluted, the FPQC is switched to the SCM to mitigate the impact caused by the polluted voltage. In this way, a desired voltage can be maintained at the load side to protect the critical load. The mode switching between PCM and SCM is realized by two relays. To ensure fast dynamics response and smooth transient operation, the model predictive control method is applied to regulate the developed FPQC. Both the simulation platform and laboratorial prototype are built to validate the effectiveness of the system. The simulation and experimental results are presented and discussed.

<p>We propose a quantitative analysis method using cell segmentation to evaluate the coating quality of anodic oxide. In order to identify each cell in a titania surface, a boundary region is adaptively detected according to the regional intensity distribution, and a boundary distance map is projected onto the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the titania surface. Each cell in the projected image is divided via clustering centered on the local maximum point. The uniformities of the cell distribution, size, and thickness are measured using the angle difference, size difference, and brightness difference between adjacent cells to comprehensively evaluate the quantitative alignment of the titania surface. The proposed method demonstrates the best performance in both cell detection and cell segmentation for SEM images of the titania surface compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The quantitative analysis of the anodic oxide film alignment was verified using color coding, histogram, and quantification of uniformity.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to the ever-increasing requirements of delay-sensitive and mission-critical applications in 5G, mobile edge computing is promising to react and support real-time interactive systems. However, it is still challenging to construct a 5G-enabled traffic management system, owing to the qualification of ultra-low latency and ubiquitous connectivity. Furthermore, the computing resources and storage capacities of edge nodes are limited, thus computation offloading is a fundamental issue for real-time traffic management. This paper puts forward a hybrid computation offloading framework for real-time traffic management in 5G networks. Specially, we consider both nonorthogonal-multiple-access-enabled and vehicle-to-vehicle-based traffic offloading. The investigated problem is formulated as a joint task distribution, subchannel assignment, and power allocation problem, with the objective of maximizing the sum offloading rate. After that, we prove its NP-hardness and decompose it into three subproblems, which can be solved iteratively. Performance evaluations illustrate the effectiveness of our framework.
