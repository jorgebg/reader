<p>Dec 14, 2018, was a dark day for universal health coverage (UHC). To begin with, a federal judge in Texas, USA, ruled that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is unconstitutional.1 That same day, the new President of Mexico, Andr&#233;s Manuel L&#243;pez Obrador, announced his intention to abolish the country's largest public insurance programme, known as Seguro Popular (People's Health Insurance).2 The ACA and Seguro Popular have extended health coverage to millions of previously uninsured families, most of them among the poorest in their respective countries.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The forensic investigation of JPEG compression generally relies on the analysis of first-order statistics based on image histogram. The JPEG compression detection methods based on such methodology can be effortlessly circumvented by adopting some anti-forensic attacks. This paper presents a counter JPEG anti-forensic method by considering the second-order statistical analysis based on the co-occurrence matrices (CMs). The proposed framework comprises three stages: selection of the target difference image, evaluation of CMs, and generation of second-order statistical feature based on CMs. In the first stage, we explore the effects of dithering operation of JPEG anti-forensics by analyzing the variance inconsistencies along the diagonals. Afterward, CMs are evaluated in the second stage to highlight the effects of grainy noise introduced during the dithering operation. The third stage is devoted to generate an optimal second-order statistical feature which is fed to the SVM classifier. The experimental results based on the uncompressed color image database and BOSSBase dataset images demonstrated that the proposed forensic detector based on CM is very efficient even in the presence of anti-forensic attacks. Moreover, the experimental results also confirm the competency of the proposed method in counter median filtering and contrast enhancement anti-forensics. The proposed scheme also provides satisfactory results in detecting other image processing operations such as mean filtering, Gaussian filtering, Weiner filtering, scaling, and rotation, thereby revealing its multi-purpose nature.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p><span class="paragraphSection"><strong>In Reply</strong> In response to our JAMA Insights article on noninvasive prenatal genetic screening, Drs Cohen and Westover advocate for universal public and private reimbursement for cfDNA tests, arguing that it will reduce disparities in access to prenatal screening. Approximately 40% of US pregnancies are supported by Medicaid. This population is, by definition, confined to the lowest end of the income scale and to women who cannot access other forms of health care coverage. These women are predominantly younger and less likely to present for care during the first trimester, which is why many Medicaid programs may not consider a more expensive aneuploidy screen to be a priority. The most prominent conditions adversely affecting pregnancies in this population are preeclampsia, risk of preterm birth, and preventable maternal-fetal morbidities due to complications, possibly linked to the rate of untreated chronic disease such as obesity and diabetes. None of these are detectable by commercial cfDNA panels but are significantly more likely to be detected and treated when women have consistent prenatal care. In declining immediate expanded reimbursement for cfDNA, many Medicaid programs are simply making rational decisions about scarce resources and the real needs of their patients.</span>

<p>Peripheral T-cell lymphoma is a rare and heterogeneous subgroup of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, comprising approximately 10&#8211;15% of all cases.1 Although there is no consensus on the optimal front-line therapy, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) has been widely adopted as the default reference regimen, with autologous stem cell transplantation consolidation performed in eligible patients. However, with the exception of younger low-risk International Prognostic Index patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma,2 outcomes in peripheral T-cell lymphoma are suboptimal, with a meta-analysis3 showing a 5-year overall survival of just 38&#183;5% with CHOP or CHOP-like regimens.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized the computer vision research and have seen unprecedented adoption for multiple tasks, such as classification, detection, and caption generation. However, they offer little transparency into their inner workings and are often treated as black boxes that deliver excellent performance. In this paper, we aim at alleviating this opaqueness of CNNs by providing visual explanations for the network&#x2019;s predictions. Our approach can analyze a variety of CNN-based models trained for computer vision applications, such as object recognition and caption generation. Unlike the existing methods, we achieve this via unraveling the forward pass operation. The proposed method exploits feature dependencies across the layer hierarchy and uncovers the discriminative image locations that guide the network&#x2019;s predictions. We name these locations CNN fixations, loosely analogous to human eye fixations. Our approach is a generic method that requires no architectural changes, additional training, or gradient computation, and computes the important image locations (CNN fixations). We demonstrate through a variety of applications that our approach is able to localize the discriminative image locations across different network architectures, diverse vision tasks, and data modalities.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of using depth information in salient object detection. However, the most commonly seen images so far are still RGB images that do not contain the depth data. Meanwhile, the human brain can extract the geometric model of a scene from an RGB-only image and hence provides a 3D perception of the scene. Inspired by this observation, we propose a new concept named RGB-&#x2018;D&#x2019; saliency detection, which derives pseudo depth from the RGB images and then performs 3D saliency detection. The pseudo depth can be utilized as image features, prior knowledge, an additional image channel, or independent depth-induced models to boost the performance of traditional RGB saliency models. As an illustration, we develop a new salient object detection algorithm that uses the pseudo depth to derive a depth-driven background prior and a depth contrast feature. Extensive experiments on several standard databases validate the promising performance of the proposed algorithm. In addition, we also adapt two supervised RGB saliency models to our RGB-&#x2018;D&#x2019; saliency framework for performance enhancement. The results further demonstrate the generalization ability of the proposed RGB-&#x2018;D&#x2019; saliency framework.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fractional interpolation is used to provide sub-pixel level references for motion compensation in the interprediction of video coding, which attempts to remove temporal redundancy in video sequences. Traditional handcrafted fractional interpolation filters face the challenge of modeling discontinuous regions in videos, while existing deep learning-based methods are either designed for a single quantization parameter (QP), only generating half-pixel samples, or need to train a model for each sub-pixel position. In this paper, we present a one-for-all fractional interpolation method based on a grouped variation convolutional neural network (GVCNN). Our method can deal with video frames coded using different QPs and is capable of generating all sub-pixel positions at one sub-pixel level. Also, by predicting variations between integer-position pixels and sub-pixels, our network offers more expressive power. Moreover, we perform specific measurements in training data generation to simulate practical situations in video coding, including blurring the down-sampled sub-pixel samples to avoid aliasing effects and coding integer pixels to simulate reconstruction errors. In addition, we analyze the impact of the size of blur kernels theoretically. Experimental results verify the efficiency of GVCNN. Compared with HEVC, our method achieves 2.2&#x0025; in bit saving on average and up to 5.2&#x0025; under low-delay P configuration.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>As one of the most widely used clustering techniques, the fuzzy  $k$ -means (FKM) assigns every data point to each cluster with a certain degree of membership. However, conventional FKM approach relies on the square data fitting term, which is sensitive to the outliers with ignoring the prior information. In this paper, we develop a novel and robust fuzzy  $k$ -means clustering algorithm, namely, joint learning of fuzzy  $k$ -means and nonnegative spectral clustering with side information. The proposed method combines fuzzy  $k$ -means and nonnegative spectral clustering into a unified model, which can further exploit the prior knowledge of data pairs such that both the quality of affinity graph and the clustering performance can be improved. In addition, for the purpose of enhancing the robustness, the adaptive loss function is adopted in the objective function, since it smoothly interpolates between  $ell _{1}$ -norm and  $ell _{2}$ -norm. Finally, experimental results on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness and the superiority of our clustering method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Hashing has attracted increasing research attention in recent years due to its high efficiency of computation and storage in image retrieval. Recent works have demonstrated the superiority of simultaneous feature representations and hash functions learning with deep neural networks. However, most existing deep hashing methods directly learn the hash functions by encoding the global semantic information, while ignoring the local spatial information of images. The loss of local spatial structure makes the performance bottleneck of hash functions, therefore limiting its application for accurate similarity retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel deep ordinal hashing (DOH) method, which learns ordinal representations to generate ranking-based hash codes by leveraging the ranking structure of feature space from both local and global views. In particular, to effectively build the ranking structure, we propose to learn the rank correlation space by exploiting the local spatial information from fully convolutional network and the global semantic information from the convolutional neural network simultaneously. More specifically, an effective spatial attention model is designed to capture the local spatial information by selectively learning well-specified locations closely related to target objects. In such hashing framework, the local spatial and global semantic nature of images is captured in an end-to-end ranking-to-hashing manner. Experimental results conducted on three widely used datasets demonstrate that the proposed DOH method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing methods.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Common fall occurrences in the elderly population pose dramatic challenges in public healthcare domain. Adoption of an efficient and yet highly reliable automatic fall detection system may not only mitigate the adverse effects of falls through immediate medical assistance, but also profoundly improve the functional ability and confidence level of elder people. This paper presents a pervasive fall detection system developed on smart phones, namely, FallDroid that exploits a two-step algorithm proposed to monitor and detect fall events using the embedded accelerometer signals. Comprising of the threshold-based method and multiple kernel learning support vector machine, the proposed algorithm uses novel techniques to effectively identify fall-like events (such as lying on a bed or sudden stop after running) and reduce false alarms. In addition to user convenience and low power consumption, experimental results reveal that the system detects falls with high accuracy ($97.8%$ and $91.7%$), sensitivity ($99.5%$ and $95.8%$), and specificity ($95.2%$ and $88.0%$) when placed around the waist and thigh, respectively. The system also achieves the lowest false alarm rate of 1 alarm per 59 h of usage, which is best till date.

A robust adaptive sliding mode control method is proposed for disturbance damping and faults tolerance, which is designed on an observer and second-order discrete-time adaptive sliding mode function. Furthermore, the reachability of sliding motion is proved. Then, the networked predictive control method is employed to compensate the communication constraints.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Extracting electric vehicle (EV) charging loads is an important aspect that enables smart grid operators to make informed and intelligent decisions about conserving power and promoting the reliability of the electrical grid. This paper presents an unsupervised algorithm to extract the EV charging loads (EVCLs) nonintrusively from the smart meter data. The proposed algorithm can run on low-frequency smart meter sampling data and only requires the real power measurement, which is the type of data communicated and recorded by most smart meters. Validation results on real aggregated household loads have shown that the proposed approach is a promising solution to extract EVCLs and that the approach can effectively mitigate the interference of other appliances that have similar load behaviors as EVs. Furthermore, the extraction of such load behaviors can be aggregated and open further smart grid analyses and studies.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The incorporation of the reconfiguration into the expansion planning of smart distribution networks is addressed in this paper, in which the potential of distributed energy resources and demand response (DR) are modeled. The system of systems (SoS) architecture is employed to model the strategy of a distribution company (DISCO), a private investor (PI), and a DR provider (DRP). The SoS is an efficient modeling architecture to model the behavior of independent and autonomous systems with distinct objective functions who are able to share some data and work together. The aim of the DISCO is to upgrade the system with the optimal cost and reliability, whereas the PI and DRP want to maximize their profit. The DISCO should try to persuade the PI to install DGs (Distributed generations) by offering the guaranteed purchasing prices. Furthermore, the DRP is a market player who can negotiate with the DISCO to sign a contract to sell the purchased DR capacities from the customers. The uncertainties of the DISCO problem is handled by using the chance-constraint method, but the PI and DRP use the conditional value at risk method to model their uncertainties. Finally, to solve the proposed model, the multiobjective optimization algorithm is employed.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>One of the major obstacles facing the large-scale integration of renewable energy sources to existing power networks is the large magnitude of fluctuations and uncertainties introduced to aggregated demand profiles. Such variations make the supply&#x2013;demand matching a more challenging task, and increase the operational cost of the power system. In this paper, we provide an effective, yet simple, methodology for smoothing power variations using the demand response of a large number of residential appliances. We first present a demand aggregation model based on queueing theory that can accommodate both deferrable and thermostatically controlled loads. Second, controllable demands are scheduled using an online algorithm to smooth the net noncontrollable demand profile. The performance of our methodology is evaluated using realistic data.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The inherent second-harmonic ripple power in a cascaded H-bridge (CHB)-based motor drive system poses the demand of large capacitors in the dc link of each cell. In this paper, an active power decoupling method based on negative sequence current injection and its corresponding dual voltage closed-loop control are proposed to solve this problem without adding any extra components. The proposed dual voltage closed-loop control system consists of a conventional active power control loop and a frequency-adaptive ripple power control loop. The ripple power control loop aims at injecting a set of negative sequence decoupling currents into the front ends of the cells to remove the ripple powers with variable frequency. Higher steady-state accuracy and robustness are, therefore, achieved compared to the open-loop control. Moreover, to simplify the control system, the ripple power control loop can be integrated into the active power control loop without introducing a harmonic reference frame transformation. By adopting the proposed control, the dc capacitance can be reduced to less than 10&#x0025; of the conventional case. The effectiveness and practicability of this method are verified by simulation and experimental results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper investigates robust control strategies for wind energy conversion systems with variable-speed permanent magnet synchronous generators, which are integrated into the grid to provide reliable, secure, and efficient electrical power. A three-phase grid-side converter without a grid transformer is connected to the grid using an LCL filter with low resistive losses. In these working conditions, an instantaneous power proportional integral (PI) controller for the outer voltage-loop in the grid-side converter is used to regulate the DC-link voltage and generate the required currents for the inner current-loop in the grid-side converter. Two integral-type terminal sliding-mode controllers are proposed to control the active and reactive powers exchanged between the converter and the grid. The switching signals in the controllers are softened to attenuate chattering. The time-varying gains in the controllers are constructed to reduce control energy wastage and avoid overestimation of the boundaries of system uncertainties. Simulated and experimental results validate the proposed method.

With a single switch and no requirement of higher duty cycle values, the proposed converter achieves a high voltage gain and high efficiency, in addition to lowered voltage and current stresses of the components.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The employment of solar microconverter allows a more detailed monitoring of the photovoltaic (PV) output power at the single module level; thus, machine learning techniques are capable to track the peculiarities of modules in the PV plants, such as regular shadings. In this way, it is possible to compare in real time the day-ahead forecast power with the actual one in order to better evaluate faults or anomalous trends that might have occurred in the PV plant. This paper presents a method for an effective fault diagnosis; this method is based on the day-ahead forecast of the output power from an existing PV module, linked to a microconverter, and on the outcome of the neighbor PV modules. Finally, this paper also proposes the analysis of the most common error definitions with new mathematical formulations, by comparing their effectiveness and immediate comprehension, in view of increasing power forecasting accuracy and performing both real-time and offline analysis of PV modules performance and possible faults.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Online social networks (OSNs) are providing a variety of applications for human users to interact with families, friends, and even strangers. One such application, the friend search engine, allows the general public to query individual users' friend lists and has been gaining popularity recently. However, without proper design, this application may mistakenly disclose users' private relationship information. Our previous work has proposed a privacy preservation solution that can effectively boost OSNs' sociability while protecting users' friendship privacy against attacks launched by individual malicious requestors. In this paper, we propose an advanced collusion attack, where a victim user's friendship privacy can be compromised through a series of carefully designed queries coordinately launched by multiple malicious requestors. The effect of the proposed collusion attack is validated through synthetic and real-world social network data sets. The in-depth research on the advanced collusion attacks will help us design a more robust and secure friend search engine on OSNs in the near future.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Garbled circuits are general tools that allow two parties to compute any function without disclosing their respective inputs. Applications of this technique vary from distributed privacy-preserving machine learning tasks to secure outsourced authentication. Unfortunately, the energy cost of garbled circuit evaluation protocols is substantial. This limits the applicability of garbled circuits in scenarios that involve battery-operated devices, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and smartphones. In this paper, we propose MEG, a Memory- and Energy-efficient Garbled circuit evaluation mechanism. MEG utilizes batch data transmission and multi-threading to reduce memory and energy consumption. We implement MEG on an Android smartphone and compare its performance and energy consumption with state-of-the-art techniques using two garbled circuits of widely different sizes (AES-128 and 256-bit edit distance). Our results show that, compared with &#x201c;plain&#x201d; garbled circuit evaluation, MEG decreases memory consumption by more than 90%. When compared with current pipelined garbled circuit evaluation techniques, MEG's energy usage was 42% lower for AES-128 and 23% lower for EDT-256. Furthermore, our multi-thread implementation of MEG decreased circuit evaluation time by up to 56.7% for AES-128, and by up to 13.5% for EDT-256, compared with state-of-the-art pipelining techniques.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to its cost efficiency, the controller area network (CAN) is still the most wide-spread in-vehicle bus, and the numerous reported attacks demonstrate the urgency in designing new security solutions for CAN. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection mechanism that takes advantage of Bloom filtering to test frame periodicity based on message identifiers and parts of the data-field which facilitates detection of potential replay or modification attacks. This proves to be an effective approach since most of the traffic from in-vehicle buses is cyclic in nature and the format of the data-field is fixed due to rigid signal allocation. Bloom filters provide an efficient time-memory tradeoff which is beneficial for the constrained resources of automotive grade controllers. We test the correctness of our approach and obtain good results on an industry-standard CANoe-based simulation for a J1939 commercial-vehicle bus and also on CAN with flexible data-rate traces obtained from a real-world high-end vehicle. The proposed filtering mechanism is straightforward to adapt for any other time-triggered in-vehicle bus, e.g., FlexRay, since it is built on time-driven characteristics.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we consider user scheduling and power allocation techniques for downlinks where transmitted message must be kept confidential from all other unintended users and the number of users is larger than that of access point (AP) antennas. In order to maximize network secrecy rate with a limited number of antennas, the AP schedules a user who can achieve the largest secrecy rate and exploits multiple antennas for transmitting artificial noise to the unintended users. We derive the closed-form expressions of the optimal power allocation for the artificial noise and the average network secrecy rate through asymptotic analysis. The analysis results provide the insightful information on the behaviors of the user scheduling and the effect of system parameters on the network secrecy rate performance. It is shown that opportunistic scheduling with artificial noise transmission technique is more effective than the conventional precoding techniques for multiple confidential message transmissions in terms of network secrecy rate. Furthermore, we have also discussed a transmission strategy for the worst case scenarios where all unintended users are treated as colluding eavesdroppers. The simulations confirm the validity of the analysis results and provide additional information on the network performance in general cases.
