<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning setting where many clients
(e.g. mobile devices or whole organizations) collaboratively train a model
under the orchestration of a central server (e.g. service provider), while
keeping the training data decentralized. FL embodies the principles of focused
data collection and minimization, and can mitigate many of the systemic privacy
risks and costs resulting from traditional, centralized machine learning and
data science approaches. Motivated by the explosive growth in FL research, this
paper discusses recent advances and presents an extensive collection of open
problems and challenges.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In recent years, the use and suitability of drones for many applications,
including surveillance, search and rescue, research, agriculture and civil
engineering, has greatly increased due to their improved affordability and
improved functionality. However, low-cost consumer drones are rarely designed
to work in fleets, which limits the applications for which business, research
and individuals may deploy such drones. Proprietary, commercial and bespoke
options are available at higher cost and existing solutions providing fleet
functionality have limited security, if any, which excludes their use for
sensitive applications. In this paper, we discuss the repurposing of consumer
off-the-shelf (COTS) drones for use in secured fleets and provide the design,
implementation and evaluation of a complete approach for creating end-to-end
secured fleets of consumer drones (SFCD).
</p>
<p>We present a protocol for securing communications within fleets whilst
employing more efficient symmetric key cryptography throughout to reduce the
impact of our security on the limited and resource-constrained COTS drones,
exploiting the characteristics of a fleet with an online and central ground
control station, which may act as a key distribution centre. The protocol
allows an arbitrary number of channels to be established to authenticate and
optionally encrypt real-time data transmitted on these channels. We also
discuss routing in fleets, as well as the control and monitoring of them, to
allow SFCD to be fully deployed; providing an extensive and thorough solution.
Our experimental evaluation confirms the suitability of low-cost consumer
drones for use in SFCD, with flight time impacted by only 9.9% and worst-case
bandwidth of 4.7Mibit/s.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Since their introduction over two decades ago, physical side-channel attacks
have presented a serious security threat. While many ciphers' implementations
employ masking techniques to protect against such attacks, they often leak
secret information due to unintended interactions in the hardware. We present
Rosita, a code rewrite engine that uses a leakage emulator which we amended to
correctly emulate the micro-architecture of a target system. We use Rosita to
automatically protect a masked implementation of AES and show the absence of
exploitable leakage at only a 11% penalty to the performance.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This work presents Arcula, a new design for hierarchical deterministic
wallets that brings identity-based addresses to the blockchain. Arcula is built
on top of provably secure cryptographic primitives. It generates all its
cryptographic secrets from a user-provided seed and enables the derivation of
new public keys based on the identities of users, without requiring any secret
information. Unlike other wallets, it achieves all these properties while being
secure against privilege escalation. We formalize the security model of
hierarchical deterministic wallets and prove that an attacker compromising an
arbitrary number of users within an Arcula wallet cannot escalate his
privileges and compromise users higher in the access hierarchy. Our design
works out-of-the-box with any blockchain that enables the verification of
signatures on arbitrary messages. We evaluate its usage in a real-world
scenario on the Bitcoin Cash network.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a popular machine learning
model for various tasks in recent years. In this paper, we study how to improve
model accuracy of GBDT while preserving the strong guarantee of differential
privacy. Sensitivity and privacy budget are two key design aspects for the
effectiveness of differential private models. Existing solutions for GBDT with
differential privacy suffer from the significant accuracy loss due to too loose
sensitivity bounds and ineffective privacy budget allocations (especially
across different trees in the GBDT model). Loose sensitivity bounds lead to
more noise to obtain a fixed privacy level. Ineffective privacy budget
allocations worsen the accuracy loss especially when the number of trees is
large. Therefore, we propose a new GBDT training algorithm that achieves
tighter sensitivity bounds and more effective noise allocations. Specifically,
by investigating the property of gradient and the contribution of each tree in
GBDTs, we propose to adaptively control the gradients of training data for each
iteration and leaf node clipping in order to tighten the sensitivity bounds.
Furthermore, we design a novel boosting framework to allocate the privacy
budget between trees so that the accuracy loss can be further reduced. Our
experiments show that our approach can achieve much better model accuracy than
other baselines.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep neural network (DNN) extracts hierarchical representations from process data and is promising for nonlinear process monitoring. Obtaining meaningful representations and generating efficient fault detection residual are the main challenges in DNN-based monitoring. This study proposes a regularized deep correlated representation (RDCR) method that incorporates deep belief networks (DBNs) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for nonlinear process monitoring. Hierarchical representations are initially extracted using DBN to process input and output variables. Second, hierarchical representations from process input and output are modeled through CCA to characterize the relationship between them. Efficient fault detection residuals are then generated, and monitoring statistics are established. CCA-based monitoring relies on the most correlated representations; thus, a multiobjective evolutionary optimization-based regularization is performed to select the most correlated representations and eliminate the influence of unrelated representations. The advantages of the RDCR monitoring are verified through experimental studies on a numerical example and the Tennessee Eastman process.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The variety of arc fault induced by different load types makes residential series arc fault detection complicated and challengeable. This paper proposes a hybrid time and frequency analysis and fully connected neural network (HTFNN) based method to identify series ac arc fault. The HTFNN method recognizes samples state by broadly classifying them into resistive (Re) category, capacitive&#x2013;inductive (CI) category, and switching (Sw) category according to the fundamental frequency components of series current. In each category, separate fully connected neural network (NN) with customized time and frequency indicators being the input is employed for fine class recognition and state identification. This method construction addresses the feature overlap among various cases by separate categories and enables suitable indicator selection within each category. Since the identification complexity in each category is cheaper than identifying all cases together, concise NNs are applied in this paper to reduce computing cost. The general accuracies of normal and arcing state identification in Re, CI, and Sw category are 99.64&#x0025;, 100&#x0025;, and 98.45&#x0025;, respectively, based on 3950 test samples. Method comparison shows that HTFNN achieves higher detection precision at lower computational complexity for generalized load types. This paper also evaluates the feasibility of implementing the method in hardware for arc fault detection device application.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to the inherent intermittent nature of renewable energy sources (RES), the control and management of microgrids become complex and require modern control techniques and management strategies to cope up with the changes in the dynamics of the system. This paper focuses on improving the dynamic performance of a microgrid by developing different energy management and control strategies employing a four-layer multiagent concept. The first layer of the proposed system is a forecasting and estimation layer and is responsible for providing the real-time forecasts for RES output power, load, and battery state of charge. The second layer is a control and action layer, assigned with the duties of taking the control decisions and actions accordingly by collecting information from different agents deployed in the system. The third layer is a real-time monitoring and control layer that provides the real-time information of the microgrid to the second layer. The fourth layer is a fault detection and action layer that facilitates the self-healing capability in the proposed microgrid. The performance and the applicability of the proposed model is tested by simulating the faults at different locations in the system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Nowadays, production-oriented manufacturing is transforming to service-oriented one, which leads to an increasing demand for high reliability of manufacturing systems. However, a popular approach to measuring terminal reliability of complex networked systems is based on graph theory, which has been shown to be an NP-hard problem. Though the NP-hard problem can be avoided by employing a statistical measure method for terminal reliability of random networks based on percolation theory, there is still lack of a general assessment approach to calculating terminal reliability of heterogeneous complex networks in intelligent manufacturing. In this paper, we propose a novel fractal-based approach to measuring the terminal reliability of heterogeneous networks. With help of the renormalization procedure that coarse grains a network into boxes containing nodes within given lateral size and inverse renormalization, which gives a fractal network growth model, a fractal network approximation of an arbitrary complex network is obtained. This fractal network topology can be described by a superposition of fractal elements based on fractal theory. Following this description, terminal reliability is the function of reliability of fractal elements. Then, a reliability assessment algorithm with computational complexity $O(N^2)$ based on fractal elements is developed. Numerical simulation is performed on a real network and a fractal network to validate the effectiveness of our method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>It is challenging to convert a hazy color image into a gray-scale image because the color contrast field of a hazy image is distorted. In this paper, a novel decolorization algorithm is proposed to transfer a hazy image into a distortion-recovered gray-scale image. To recover the color contrast field, the relationship between the restored color contrast and its distorted input is presented in CIELab color space. Based on this restoration, a nonlinear optimization problem is formulated to construct the resultant gray-scale image. A new differentiable approximation solution is introduced to solve this problem with an extension of the Huber loss function. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm effectively preserves the global luminance consistency while represents the original color contrast in gray-scales, which is very close to the corresponding ground truth gray-scale one.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Multi-task deep learning methods learn multiple tasks simultaneously and share representations amongst them, so information from related tasks improves learning within one task. The generalization capabilities of the produced models are substantially enhanced. Typical multi-task deep learning models usually share representations of different tasks in lower layers of the network, and separate representations of different tasks in higher layers. However, different groups of tasks always have different requirements for sharing representations, so the required design criterion does not necessarily guarantee that the obtained network architecture is optimal. In addition, most existing methods ignore the redundancy problem and lack the pre-screening process for representations before they are shared. Here, we propose a model called Attention-aware Multi-task Convolutional Neural Network, which automatically learns appropriate sharing through end-to-end training. The attention mechanism is introduced into our architecture to suppress redundant contents contained in the representations. The shortcut connection is adopted to preserve useful information. We evaluate our model by carrying out experiments on different task groups and different datasets. Our model demonstrates an improvement over existing techniques in many experiments, indicating the effectiveness and the robustness of the model. We also demonstrate the importance of attention mechanism and shortcut connection in our model.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Light field (LF) stitching is a potential solution to improve the field of view (FOV) for hand-held plenoptic cameras. Existing LF stitching methods cannot provide accurate registration for scenes with large depth variation. In this paper, a novel LF stitching method is proposed to handle parallax in the LFs more flexibly and accurately. First, a depth layer map (DLM) is proposed to guarantee adequate feature points on each depth layer. For the regions of nondeterministic depth, superpixel layer map (SLM) is proposed based on LF spatial correlation analysis to refine the depth layer assignments. Then, DLM-SLM-based LF registration is proposed to derive the location dependent homography transforms accurately and to warp LFs to its corresponding position without parallax interference. 4D graph-cut is further applied to fuse the registration results for higher LF spatial continuity and angular continuity. Horizontal, vertical and multi-LF stitching are tested for different scenes, which demonstrates the superior performance provided by the proposed method in terms of subjective quality of the stitched LFs, epipolar plane image consistency in the stitched LF, and perspective-averaged correlation between the stitched LF and the input LFs.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The accuracy of power electronics simulation relies on the semiconductor switch model employed. Thus, in this paper where an ultrafast mechatronic circuit breaker (UFMCB) is implemented in real-time on the field programmable gate array, a detailed nonlinear thyristor model is proposed for extra device-level information regarding design evaluation. The cascaded thyristors impose a heavy computational burden on the UFMCB simulation, and node elimination is achieved following the proposal of a scalable thyristor model. For the convenience of the circuit breaker's integration into dc grid, a pair of coupled voltage-current sources is inserted as its interface, which achieves a reduction in the dimension of system admittance matrix, and the subsequent proposal of a relaxed scalar Newton-Raphson method further expedites the simulation by decomposing the nodal matrix equation. Meanwhile, the modular multilevel converter as a dc grid terminal adopts half-bridge and clamped double submodule topologies to test system performance in conjunction with the UFMCB. Real-time execution is achieved and the results are validated by ANSYS/Simplorer and PSCAD/EMTDC in device- and system-level, respectively.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent development of object detection mainly depends on deep learning with large-scale benchmarks. However, collecting such fully-annotated data is often difficult or expensive for real-world applications, which restricts the power of deep neural networks in practice. Alternatively, humans can detect new objects with little annotation burden, since humans often use the prior knowledge to identify new objects with few elaborately-annotated examples, and subsequently generalize this capacity by exploiting objects from wild images. Inspired by this procedure of learning to detect, we propose a novel Progressive Object Transfer Detection (POTD) framework. Specifically, we make three main contributions in this paper. First, POTD can leverage various object supervision of different domains effectively into a progressive detection procedure. Via such human-like learning, one can boost a target detection task with few annotations. Second, POTD consists of two delicate transfer stages, i.e., Low-Shot Transfer Detection (LSTD), and Weakly-Supervised Transfer Detection (WSTD). In LSTD, we distill the implicit object knowledge of source detector to enhance target detector with few annotations. It can effectively warm up WSTD later on. In WSTD, we design a recurrent object labelling mechanism for learning to annotate weakly-labeled images. More importantly, we exploit the reliable object supervision from LSTD, which can further enhance the robustness of target detector in the WSTD stage. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on a number of challenging detection benchmarks with different settings. The results demonstrate that, our POTD outperforms the recent state-of-the-art approaches. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/Cassie94/LSTD/tree/lstd.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a new robust field-weakening approach for reluctance synchronous motors regulated by direct torque and flux control. Compared to the existing direct torque and flux control based field-weakening methods that cannot achieve maximized DC-link voltage utilization and are parameter dependent, the proposed approach contributes to improve the field-weakening performance of reluctance synchronous motor in two aspects. First, it extends the constant power speed range through autonomous stator flux reference adjustment, which maximizes the dc-link voltage utilization. Smooth transition between the maximum torque per ampere trajectory and field-weakening trajectory is also realized. Second, it enhances the parameter robustness of drives in very high-speed region by employing a torque reference adjustment scheme. This effectively avoids the instability of drives caused by machine parameter variations. The proposed approach is verified experimentally on a laboratory setup.

<p>The dynamic analysis of induction motors is supported by well-known theories: the two-axes transformation, and the space vector theory. Yet some inconsistencies with the theory of dynamic systems exist. The machine eigenvalues suggest the existence of two damped oscillators, physically not understandable. The respective eigenfrequencies change with the angular velocity of the reference frame. This contradicts the understanding that eigenfrequencies are inherent system properties. Physically, the dynamics depend on the continuous distribution of magnetic energy and its spatial displacement during transient processes. Information on the system dynamics is lost when dividing the continuum of magnetic energy into discrete portions. Complex state variables associate the dynamics to the propagation in space of distributed magnetic fields. The dynamic analysis reveals the existence single-complex eigenvalues. These define a novel class of system identifiers. They are characterized by having only one imaginary part instead of a conjugate complex pair. The use of complex state variables conveys insight and physical understanding of the dynamic processes within the machine. The approach constitutes an extension to the theory of dynamic systems.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The screen content (SC) pictures, such as webpages, serve as a visible and convenient medium to well-represent the Internet information, and therefore, the visual quality of SC pictures is highly significant and has attained a growing amount of attention. Accurate quality evaluation of SC pictures not only provides the fidelity of the conveyed information, but also contributes to the improvement of the user experience. In practical applications, a reliable estimation of SC pictures plays a considerably critical role for the optimization of the processing systems as the guidance. Based on these motivations, this paper proposes a novel method for precisely assessing the quality of SC pictures using very sparse reference information. Specifically, the proposed quality method separately extracts the macroscopic and microscopic structures, followed by comparing the differences of macroscopic and microscopic features between a pristine SC picture and its corrupted version to infer the overall quality score. By studying the feature histogram for dimensionality reduction, the proposed method merely requires two features as the reference information that can be exactly embedded in the file header with very few bits. Experiments manifest the superiority of our algorithm as compared with state-of-the-art relevant quality metrics when applied to the visual quality evaluation of SC pictures.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to the limits on market requirements, material conditions, and production situations in manufacturing process, conventional optimization approaches are difficult to obtain optimal economical and technical indices with physical constraints. To optimize several conflicting objects such as production rate, economic benefits, and gas emission, a hybrid-model-based intelligent optimization method that consists of an improved genetic algorithm and derived deep learning is put forward in this paper. Integration of the hybrid model has made modeling and optimizing an indivisible whole, in which the fitness of the genetic algorithm comes from deep neural networks by weighted sum of the output variables that correspond to the input solutions. The recurrent neural network (RNN) with disposition-gated recurrent unit (dGRU) is applied to capture the dynamics of blast furnace by training the model over datasets recorded in the production scene. Meanwhile, the self-adaptive population genetic algorithm (SAPGA) with a varied population size depending on the fitness distribution is used to locate the optimal solutions under current working conditions. The hybrid intelligent optimization model, validated by both numerical tests and practical data, has been running in an ironmaking plant for one year. It has proved to be successful in meeting industry demands by optimizing multiproduction indices simultaneously.

<p>A family of texture-based generative models for fingerprint images is proposed. The generative models are used to estimate upper bounds on the image entropy for systems with small sensor acquisition. The identification capacity of such systems is then estimated using the mutual information between different samples from the same finger. Similar to the generative model for entropy estimation, pixel-level model families are proposed for estimating the similarity between fingerprint images with a given global affine transformation. These models are used for mutual information estimation, and are also adopted to compensate for local deformations between samples. Finally, it is shown that sensor sizes as small as 52 &#x00d7; 52 pixels are potentially sufficient to discriminate populations as large as the entire world population that ever lived, given that the complexity-unconstrained recognition algorithm is available which operates on the lowest possible pixel level.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Massive MIMO attains high spectral and power efficiency transmission by leveraging a large number of transmit antennas. However, to capture the benefits of massive MIMO, each antenna should be accompanied with a dedicated RF chain, and consequently, the hardware costs would scale up tremendously with the increase of the antennas. Cheap implementations of massive MIMO have recently gained considerable attention, and constant modulus (CM) signaling is seen as a promising solution, owing to its low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). This paper investigates the physical-layer (PHY) security in massive MIMO with an emphasis on the CM signaling. In particular, we consider a transmitter with massive antennas broadcast common confidential information to a group of legitimate receivers, and a number of eavesdroppers overhear the transmission and attempt to intercept the information. Our goal is to design the CM beamforming at the transmitter so that the multicast secrecy rate is maximized. This secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is generally NP-hard. To tackle it, two tractable approaches are developed. The first one employs the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique and the Charnes-Copper transformation to obtain a convex relaxation of the SRM problem. However, due to the dimension lifting of SDR, this approach is feasible only for small to medium antenna sizes. The second approach leverages the Dinkelbach method to work directly over the beamformer domain; a custom-build nonconvex alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed to efficiently perform each Dinkelbach update. Simulation results demonstrate that the second approach is computationally more efficient and can achieve nearly optimal performance when the number of antennas is large.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the optimal tradeoff between secrecy and non-secrecy rates of the MISO wiretap channels for different power constraint settings: sum power constraint only, per-antenna power constraints only, and joint sum and per-antenna power constraints. The problem is motivated by the fact that channel capacity and secrecy capacity are generally achieved by different transmit strategies. First, a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure a positive secrecy capacity is shown. The optimal tradeoff between secrecy rate and transmission rate is characterized by a weighted rate sum maximization problem. Since this problem is not necessarily convex, equivalent problem formulations are introduced to derive the optimal transmit strategies. Under sum power constraint only, a closed-form solution is provided. Under per-antenna power constraints, necessary conditions to find the optimal power allocation are derived. Sufficient conditions are provided for the special case of two transmit antennas. For the special case of aligned channels, the optimal transmit strategies can deduced from an equivalent point-to-point channel problem. Last, the theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Anomaly detection is an important technique used to identify patterns of unusual network behavior and keep the network under control. Today, network attacks are increasing in terms of both their number and sophistication. To avoid causing significant traffic patterns and being detected by existing techniques, many new attacks tend to involve gradual adjustment of behaviors, which always generate incomplete sessions due to their running mechanisms. Accordingly, in this work, we employ the behavior symmetry degree to profile the anomalies and further identify unusual behaviors. We first proposed a symmetry degree to identify the incomplete sessions generated by unusual behaviors; we then employ a sketch to calculate the symmetry degree of internal hosts to improve the identification efficiency for online applications. To reduce the memory cost and probability of collision, we divide the IP addresses into four segments that can be used as keys of the hash functions in the sketch. Moreover, to further improve detection accuracy, a threshold selection method is proposed for dynamic traffic pattern analysis. The hash functions in the sketch are then designed using Chinese remainder theory, which can analytically trace the IP addresses associated with the anomalies. We tested the proposed techniques based on traffic data collected from the northwest center of CERNET (China Education and Research Network); the results show that the proposed methods can effectively detect anomalies in large-scale networks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel deep sparse coding network (SCN) capable of efficiently adapting its own regularization parameters for a given application. The network is trained end-to-end with a supervised task-driven learning algorithm via error backpropagation. During training, the network learns both the dictionaries and the regularization parameters of each sparse coding layer so that the reconstructive dictionaries are smoothly transformed into increasingly discriminative representations. In addition, the adaptive regularization also offers the network more flexibility to adjust sparsity levels. Furthermore, we have devised a sparse coding layer utilizing a &#x201c;skinny&#x201d; dictionary. Integral to computational efficiency, these skinny dictionaries compress the high-dimensional sparse codes into lower dimensional structures. The adaptivity and discriminability of our 15-layer SCN are demonstrated on six benchmark datasets, namely Cifar-10, Cifar-100, STL-10, SVHN, MNIST, and ImageNet, most of which are considered difficult for sparse coding models. Experimental results show that our architecture overwhelmingly outperforms traditional one-layer sparse coding architectures while using much fewer parameters. Moreover, our multilayer architecture exploits the benefits of depth with sparse coding's characteristic ability to operate on smaller datasets. In such data-constrained scenarios, our technique demonstrates a highly competitive performance compared with the deep neural networks.
