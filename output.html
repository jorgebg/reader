<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We consider a private data set composed of a set of individuals, and the data are outsourced to a remote cloud server. We revisit the classic query auditing problem in this outsourcing scenario; the cloud audits each newly arrived query on a single attribute, and the query is rejected if answering it compromises any individual's privacy. Various query auditing issues have been studied and addressed before. However, previous auditing schemes either have the difficulty of removing denial threats, or lack the analysis of utility (which is defined as the number of answered queries). In this paper, we study the auditing of a sequence of polynomial-time computable queries. Each query is of format f(X&#x0303;) a, where f is any polynomial function, X&#x0303; is a subset of the private data set, and the answer is either &#x201c;yes&#x201d; or &#x201c;no&#x201d;. Existing methods cannot be applied directly to audit such a query, because it intermingles several types of functions (e.g., sum and max/min). Hence, we propose CASTLE, which is an inequality query auditing scheme that evaluates the risk of answering a query based on the query history and determines whether a newly arrived query should be answered correctly against a denial threat. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of the existing query auditing mechanisms, which are of low utility, we relax CASTLE to increase the utility by returning answers with slight perturbations. We show that our method can be applied to audit intermingled equality queries with an extension. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>New strains of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have exhibited potential to disconnect communication networks, even cutting off entire countries from the Internet. The &#x201c;crossfire&#x201d; is a new, indirect DDoS link-flooding attack, which masks itself as natural congestion, making it very hard to counter. Several studies have proposed online attack detection schemes, whose efficiency has been shown to vary in different network topologies. However, the topology/detection relation has been studied qualitatively, without formal proof or quantification metric. This paper is motivated by the fact that network topology changes are generally expensive and slow. Therefore, network designers should be provided with means of evaluating the effects of topology modifications to the attack detection efficiency. This paper fills this gap by contributing a formal proof for the topology-detection efficiency relation, as well as a novel off-line metric that quantifies it. Full attack prototypes are implemented and evaluated in real-Internet topologies, validating the analytical findings. It is shown that the novel metric expresses the topology-detection relation efficiently, while existing and widely used metrics do not constitute good choices for this task.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The classical Bloom filter data structure is a crucial component of hundreds of cryptographic protocols. It has been used in privacy preservation and secure computation settings, often in conjunction with the (somewhat) homomorphic properties of ciphers such as Paillier's. In 2014, a new data structure extending and surpassing the capabilities of the classical Bloom filter has been proposed. The new primitive, called spatial Bloom filter (SBF) retains the hash-based membership-query design of the Bloom filter, but applies it to elements from multiple sets. Since its introduction, the SBF has been used in the design of cryptographic protocols for a number of domains, including location privacy and network security. However, due to the complex nature of this probabilistic data structure, its properties had not been fully understood. In this paper, we address this gap in knowledge and we fully explore the probabilistic properties of the SBF. In doing so, we define a number of metrics (such as emersion and safeness) useful in determining the parameters needed to achieve certain characteristics in a filter, including the false positive probability and inter-set error rate. This will in turn enable the design of more efficient cryptographic protocols based on the SBF, opening the way to their practical application in a number of security and privacy settings.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The principle of compressed sensing (CS) can be applied in a cryptosystem by providing the notion of security. The Gaussian one-time sensing (G-OTS) CS-based cryptosystem employing a random Gaussian matrix and renewing the elements at each encryption is known to be perfectly secure, as long as each plaintext has constant energy. A random Bernoulli matrix can replace the Gaussian one for encrypting each plaintext efficiently in the Bernoulli one-time sensing (B-OTS) cryptosystem. In this paper, we analyze the security of G-OTS and B-OTS cryptosystems, respectively, where each cryptosystem may have unequal plaintext energy. By means of probability metrics, we study the indistinguishability of each CS-based cryptosystem, which formalizes the notion of computational security. Moreover, we investigate how much the indistinguishability is sensitive to energy variation of plaintexts in each cryptosystem. For the B-OTS cryptosystem, we analyze the indistinguishability and the energy sensitivity in a non-asymptotic manner for a finite plaintext length. In conclusion, this paper confirms that G-OTS and B-OTS cryptosystems can be strictly and asymptotically indistinguishable, respectively, as long as each plaintext has constant energy, but the indistinguishability is highly sensitive to energy variation of plaintexts.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we consider the design of a new secure transmission scheme for a four-node relay-eavesdropper channel, where user cooperation is used to facilitate secure communications. The key idea of the proposed achievable scheme is to apply the compression relaying concept of noisy network coding (NNC) to the secrecy communication scenario. But different from the original non-secrecy NNC, the compression rate at the relay is adaptively chosen according to the eavesdropping channel. Particularly, helping interference information is injected into the compression codebook at the relay by simply enlarging the compression rate, which is to effectively suppress the eavesdropping channel. Closed-form expressions of the secrecy rates achieved by the proposed NNC-based secure scheme are characterized for both the discrete memoryless and Gaussian relay-eavesdropper channels, where the optimal compression rate and the optimal transmit power at the relay are also determined. The proposed secure scheme can be viewed as a general framework, which naturally combines the NNC compression relaying scheme with the interference-assisted scheme. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed secure scheme offers constant performance gains over typical existing cooperative secure schemes.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This study adopts the method of third-order harmonic voltage injection (THVI) to move the peak value of a reference voltage toward the high capacitor voltage and increase the utilization rate of the capacitor voltage. This method can lower the cost or enlarge the capacity of a modular multilevel converter (MMC) when applied in high-voltage direct-current transmission. In this paper, the principle of THVI is introduced. Two calculation methods for modulation waves are studied, and the mathematical expressions of the capacitor voltage under all operating conditions are deduced. Thus, the optimal magnitude and phase of the third-order harmonic voltage are determined under all operating conditions. The mathematical expressions of the optimal magnitude and phase of the third-order harmonic voltage are obtained, and their online calculation burden is reduced. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method of THVI is feasible and effective.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a single-switch single power-conversion (S$^text{3}$ PC) power factor correction (PFC) converter. Using the series-resonant circuit, the S $^text{3}$PC converter provides bidirectional core excitation for the transformer and obtains higher power capability compared with the conventional single-switch PFC converters. Also, the series-resonant circuit provides zero-current switching turn-off for the output diodes, so that the reverse-recovery loss is alleviated. The regenerative snubber not only avoids the voltage spike of the switch but also recycles the absorbed energy. Because these features are obtained with only a single switch and through single power-conversion, the S$^text{3}$PC converter has high efficiency and simple structure. The control algorithm derived from feedback linearization enables the S$^text{3}$PC converter to obtain good controllability. Also, by using this control algorithm, the proposed converter performs both PFC control and output power control through single power-conversion. With these advantages, the S $^text{3}$PC converter provides maximum efficiency of 96.4&#x0025; and high power factor in excess of 0.994. The proposed converter is theoretically analyzed in detail, and experimental results are applied to a 1-kW prototype to show its validity.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper develops a novel voltage equalizer by combining wireless power transfer (WPT) and a voltage multiplier (VM) for series-connected energy storage cells. The physical isolation achieved by WPT can offer several unique benefits that traditional equalizers can hardly provide. In this paper, the characteristics of a multiple-output VM are analytically discussed and used to develop an equivalent one-output VM model. Based on this model, parameters of the WPT system are properly designed. The proposed design methodology can achieve a single-switch voltage equalizer without feedback control, which dramatically decreases the circuit complexity and cost. Moreover, this methodology can naturally ensure a robust system under small coil misalignment. In the experiment, the proposed system is built to balance four series-connected ultracapacitor modules. The system efficiency is 72.8&#x0025; at a load power level of 10 W.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction and state-of-health (SOH) diagnosis are of extreme importance for safety, durability, and cost of energy storage systems based on lithium-ion batteries. It is also a crucial challenge for energy storage systems to predict RUL and diagnose SOH of batteries due to the complicated aging mechanism. In this paper, a novel method for battery RUL prediction and SOH estimation is proposed. First, a novel support vector regression-based battery SOH state-space model is established to simulate the battery aging mechanism, which takes the capacity as the state variable and takes the representative features during a constant-current and constant-voltage protocol as the input variables. The estimated impedance variables are taken as the output due to the correlation between battery capacity and the sum of charge transfer resistance and electrolyte resistance. Second, in order to suppress the measurement noises of current and voltage, a particle filter is employed to estimate the impedance degradation parameters. Furthermore, experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method. The results show that the proposed SOH estimation method can provide an accurate and robustness result. The proposed RUL prediction framework can also ensure an accurate RUL prediction result.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>As more and more data become available for machine prognostic analysis in the big data environment, effective data suitability assessment methods become highly desired to help locate data with sufficient quality for analysis. Driven by this purpose, this paper proposes a novel and systematic methodology for data suitability assessment based on the needs of prognostics and health management (PHM). In this study, the data suitability for PHM is assessed from the aspects of detectability, diagnosability, and trendability, which correspond to the three major tasks of PHM: fault detection, fault diagnosis, and degradation assessment. The proposed methodology is mainly built upon the recent research studies on maximum mean discrepancy in the field of machine learning, which include a family of test statistics that are used to test the difference between two data distributions. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated in diverse industrial applications, which include semiconductors, boring tool degradation, and sensorless drive diagnosis. The results in the case studies indicate that the proposed methodology can be a promising tool to evaluate whether the data under study or the extracted feature set is suitable for PHM tasks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Component pick-and-place technology has been widely used to improve production efficiency and reduce common defects. The vision-driven measurement system of a component pick-and-place machine requires an appropriate positioning algorithm with low computational complexity, high accuracy, and high generalizability. To satisfy these attributes is rather challenging. This paper focuses on the online component positioning problem based on corner points. Thus, we propose a robust, accurate, and efficient universal algorithm that incorporates preprocessing, coarse positioning, and fine positioning stages. Two types of model key points are introduced for interpreting the model component. To enhance positioning accuracy and robustness against illumination changes, the Harris corners and subpixel corner points are extracted from the images of real components. In the coarse positioning step, distance and shape feature matching methods are introduced to, respectively, compute the coarse and correct correspondences between type I model key points and Harris corner points. After the corresponding point pairs have been obtained, the coarse and fine positioning problems are formulated as least squares error problems. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by applying the method in several real component positioning experiments.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a System-on-Chip design for real-time satellites photovoltaic curves telemetry. In these applications, the limitation of memory and communication bandwidth makes quite difficult to store and to transmit the whole characteristic current-voltage (I-V) curve of any solar section in real-time. The proposed solution is based on the real-time calculation of the equivalent single-diode model of the solar section. The single-diode model fits accurately the behavior of any solar panel, so once the parameters are calculated, saved, and transmitted, at any working conditions, that specific curve could be later reproduced. The system is based on a LEON3 32-bit microprocessor core implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array. The LEON microprocessors were originally designed by the European Space Agency, Paris, France, to be used in space projects where high reliability is required. In addition, in order to design the system as simple and reliable as possible, from all the methods available in the literature to extract the five parameters of the equivalent model, the Oblique Asymptote Method has been chosen for its simplicity and precision. Finally, some experimental results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the final system.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Downtime is a key performance index for industrial automation systems. An industrial automation system achieves maximum productivity when its downtime is reduced to the minimum. One approach to minimize downtime is to predict system faults and recover from them automatically. A cloud-based decision support system is proposed for rapid problem identifications and to assist the self-management processes. By running multiple parallel simulations of control software with real-time inputs ahead of system time, faults could be detected and corrected automatically using autonomous industrial software agents. Fault trees, as well as control algorithms, are modeled using IEC 61499 function blocks that can be directly executed on both physical controllers and cloud services. A case study of water heating process is used to demonstrate the self-healing process supported by the cloud-based decision support system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The wide-area measurement system provides a new data acquisition and supervisory control tool for a power system, and the data acquisition level is increased dramatically with its development in the smart grid environment. Huge data associated with the power system operation are acquired, which are beneficial for enhancing situational awareness of a power system concerned. Identifying the coherency among synchronous generators using real-time signals from phasor measurement units (PMUs) is one of the major tasks of situational awareness in power system operation. Given this background, a data-driven coherency identification methodology is proposed based on the spectral clustering algorithm. First, several trajectory dissimilarity indices for the rotor angle and rotor speed trajectories of generators as measured by PMUs are presented based on the trajectory similarity theory. Second, a decision-making method based on the Gini coefficient and Kendall rank correlation coefficient is presented for integrating multiple indices describing trajectory dissimilarities. Third, the spectral clustering algorithm is presented to identify the coherency of synchronous generators, and silhouette is presented for determining a reasonable number of coherent groups. Finally, oscillation events happened/simulated in two actual power systems, i.e., Guangdong power system in China and Western Interconnection power system in North America, are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven coherency identification methodology.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/issue/current">The Lancet</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>I was surprised to read that the GETSET trial by Lucy Clark and colleagues1 excluded participants who had physical contraindications to exercise, as such a criterion would appear to exclude anyone suffering from post-exertional malaise (PEM). In its 2015 report,2 the US Institute of Medicine concluded: &#8220;There is sufficient evidence that PEM is a primary feature that helps distinguish ME/CFS [myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome] from other conditions&#8221;. Indeed, post-exertional neuroimmune exhaustion is a compulsory requirement for a diagnosis of myalgic encephalomyelitis under the International Consensus Criteria.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/issue/current">The Lancet</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Among patients who had lumbar puncture, atraumatic needles were associated with a decrease in the incidence of postdural-puncture headache and in the need for patients to return to hospital for additional therapy, and had similar efficacy to conventional needles. These findings offer clinicians and stakeholders a comprehensive assessment and high-quality evidence for the safety and efficacy of atraumatic needles as a superior option for patients who require lumbar puncture.
