<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Moving steganography and steganalysis from the laboratory into the real world, the robustness of steganography needs to be further considered. In this paper, we propose a robust steganographic algorithm to resist the JPEG compression of transport channel based on transport channel matching. Transport channel matching can adjust images to meet the requirements of transport channel so that the impact of JPEG compression from the channel can be reduced. To improve the robustness of steganography, the embedded message bits will be encoded by the error correction code. Then, the adaptive steganographic algorithms will be used to embed messages. To enhance the coding rate, the error correction capability t of the error correction code is dynamically adjusted according to the images. Experimental results on the local simulation of JPEG compression and social network site demonstrate that the proposed steganographic algorithm has a good performance with respect to both robustness and security.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a tightly coupled inductive power transfer (IPT) system for the low-voltage and high-current charging of automatic guided vehicles (AGVs). There are two challenges in the system design. First, the widely varying range of the airgap introduces difficulties to design the compensation circuit. Second, the low-voltage and high-current working condition introduces difficulties to maintain the system efficiency. This paper reveals that there are a large amount of high-order harmonic currents in a tightly coupled IPT system, and we have provided an effective design method to reduce the harmonics. The integrated LCC compensation circuit is selected as a solution, showing four merits: good robustness to the airgap variation, easy controllability, convenience to optimize the efficiency, and low high-order harmonics. A prototype is implemented, and the magnetic coupler size is 220 &#x00d7; 200 &#x00d7; 10&#x00a0;mm. Experimental results show that it achieves 1.78&#x00a0;kW power transfer from a 300&#x00a0;V dc source to a 24&#x00a0;V battery with 86.1&#x0025; efficiency and a 73.8&#x00a0;A charging current across an airgap of 15&#x00a0;mm. When the airgap varies between 5 and 25&#x00a0;mm, the system power variation is within &#x00b1;36.7&#x0025; and the efficiency is not significantly affected.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>For boost converter operating in the discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), feedback and feedforward compensators are widely used to improve the converter performance. However, it is relatively difficult to optimize load transient response (LoTR), line transient response (LiTR), and reference tracking speed (RTS) simultaneously, since the optimizations require different compensators that are incompatible. In order to solve the issue, a superposed compensation strategy is proposed in this paper, which consists of a feedback compensator and two feedforward compensators. Each compensator is tuned according to an objective transfer function, which optimizes LoTR, LiTR, and RTS. The outputs are summed as duty cycle according to the linear superposition principle. Compatibility of the compensators is improved by designing the feedforward compensators to adapt to the feedback compensator. Furthermore, based on the closed-loop model, design rules for the objective transfer functions are given to minimize the influences of the sample-and-hold effect and calculation delay, which are intrinsic in a digital controller. Finally, converter&#x0027;s LoTR, LiTR, and RTS are simultaneously optimized, which is proven by closed-loop magnitude&#x2013;frequency plots, state trajectory analyses, and experimental results.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The gaze estimation in the mobile scenario often suffers from the extrapolation and parallax errors. In this paper, we propose a novel calibration framework to achieve the precise gaze estimation for head-mounted gaze trackers. Our proposed framework consists of two steps to learn a point-to-point and a point-to-line relations, respectively. The aim of step I is to infer the relation between pupil centers and spatially constrained points of regard. By adopting the &#x201c;CalibMe&#x201d; gaze data acquisition method, a sparse Gaussian Process using pseudo-inputs is used to capture the smooth residual field unmodeled by the polynomial function. Meanwhile, a distraction detection criterion is introduced to identify the moment when user&#x0027;s attention is taken away from the calibration point thereby removing outliers. By combining with the point-to-point relation inferred in step I, the observed parallax errors are leveraged in step II to obtain a point-to-line relation, i.e., each pupil center will correspond to an epipolar line. Thus, the real image gaze point projected from different depths is predicted as the intersection of two epipolar lines inferred from binocular data. The simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed calibration framework for head-mounted gaze trackers.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Soft sensing of quality&#x002f;key variables is critical to the control and optimization of industrial processes. One of the main drawbacks of data-driven soft sensors is to deal with the dynamic and nonlinear characteristics of process data. This paper proposes a deep learning structure and corresponding training algorithm for the purpose of soft sensor, which is called probabilistic sequential network. The proposed model merges unsupervised feature extraction and supervised dynamic modeling approaches to improve the prediction performance. It is mainly based on the Gaussian-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machine and the recurrent neural network structure. To avoid the overfitting problem in the training procedure of deep learning algorithms, the L2 regularization and dropout technique are adopted. The new method can not only deeply extract the nonlinear feature but also widely capture dynamic characteristic of process data. Effectiveness and superiority of the new method are validated through an actual CO<sub>2</sub> absorption column, compared to traditional methods.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We propose a quantitative analysis method using cell segmentation to evaluate the coating quality of anodic oxide. In order to identify each cell in a titania surface, a boundary region is adaptively detected according to the regional intensity distribution, and a boundary distance map is projected onto the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the titania surface. Each cell in the projected image is divided via clustering centered on the local maximum point. The uniformities of the cell distribution, size, and thickness are measured using the angle difference, size difference, and brightness difference between adjacent cells to comprehensively evaluate the quantitative alignment of the titania surface. The proposed method demonstrates the best performance in both cell detection and cell segmentation for SEM images of the titania surface compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The quantitative analysis of the anodic oxide film alignment was verified using color coding, histogram, and quantification of uniformity.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to the ever-increasing requirements of delay-sensitive and mission-critical applications in 5G, mobile edge computing is promising to react and support real-time interactive systems. However, it is still challenging to construct a 5G-enabled traffic management system, owing to the qualification of ultra-low latency and ubiquitous connectivity. Furthermore, the computing resources and storage capacities of edge nodes are limited, thus computation offloading is a fundamental issue for real-time traffic management. This paper puts forward a hybrid computation offloading framework for real-time traffic management in 5G networks. Specially, we consider both nonorthogonal-multiple-access-enabled and vehicle-to-vehicle-based traffic offloading. The investigated problem is formulated as a joint task distribution, subchannel assignment, and power allocation problem, with the objective of maximizing the sum offloading rate. After that, we prove its NP-hardness and decompose it into three subproblems, which can be solved iteratively. Performance evaluations illustrate the effectiveness of our framework.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A high-speed squirrel-cage induction machine requires a totally different design compared to the traditional squirrel-cage industrial motor because of the mechanical limitations caused by the high speed. This results in a more complicated rotor construction and expensive material selection, and sets higher standards for the manufacturing precision. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the design aspects, material selection, and manufacturing of a squirrel-cage rotor for high-speed applications. In this paper, the rotor dimensioning approach based on equations and data analysis is presented. Rotor material selection and construction topology influence on the electrical machine design are discussed. The results are illustrated with the design of a 6-kW, 120&#x00a0;000-r/min induction machine for a turbo circulator. The influence of rotor parameters on the electromagnetic performance of the designed machine is demonstrated. Mechanical stresses for different topologies are studied with finite-element method analysis. Several manufacturing methods for producing a high-precision rotor are described and compared. The presented rotor design approach, which enables high electromagnetic performance and robust construction, is verified by the testing of a prototype.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a cooperative control of clutch and hydraulic control unit is proposed for the hill-start assist control (HAC) based on the autohold system in order to improve safety and ride comfort. The autohold system model is established as a linear system with bounded uncertainty and disturbance. Then, a novel disturbance-observer-based control is adopted based on an integrated feedforward-feedback compensation, of which the stability and robustness are guaranteed by the $H_infty$ control theory. The feedforward compensation is recast to a nonlinear and multiobjective optimization problem with some constraints. Finally, the proposed method is verified by the experiments performed on a standard proving ground, and the main results are also provided.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Aluminum electrolytic capacitors (AECs) are connected in a bank to meet the requirement of capacitance, voltage, and current rating for dc-link of power electronic converters. The performance of capacitor bank deteriorates with time due to the degradation of AECs in the bank. Further, each AEC in the bank degrades differently based on its core temperature, which in turn depends on the current and its equivalent series resistance (ESR). Therefore, health monitoring of a bank would require monitoring of individual AECs in the bank. However, extending the available literature on health monitoring of an AEC to the capacitor bank would require voltage/current sensors for individual AECs. To address the aforementioned issue, this paper suggests a method to assess the health of individual AECs online in the bank without using sensors for each AECs. The proposed method involves estimation of current through each capacitor, which is used to determine the core temperature by using a thermal model of AEC. The core temperature is used for estimation of ESR and capacitance of each capacitor using physics-of-failure based degradation model. For the consistent matching of the degradation model to the actual degradation of the capacitor, the coefficients of the model are sequentially updated. For updating, an algorithm based on extended Kalman filter is used. The proposed scheme is experimentally validated on laboratory prototype of single-phase, grid-connected solar PV inverter under variable load conditions.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a novel method to estimate the number of shorted turns in a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) following the detection of interturn short-circuit (ITSC) fault and its location. In this proposed method, PMSM is excited through a low sinusoidal voltage at standstill condition to obtain the winding resistance and synchronous inductance by current response. It is shown that the ITSC fault introduces variation in the current response, which can be used to calculate the number of shorted turns under zero fault resistance assumption. Using this practical procedure, the fault severity can be estimated directly in a straight-forward manner. In other words, the severity estimation for a given machine can be done without complex machine modeling or experiments on ITSC prototype with multiple taps. The findings in this paper are essential for a comprehensive solution including fault mitigation algorithms and postfault operations. In order to verify the findings, a three-phase equivalent circuit model supported by finite element analysis results is used to take saturation and space harmonics into account. In addition, experimental results are presented to demonstrate the validity and practicability of the severity estimation.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deception plays critical roles in economics and technology, especially in emerging interactions in cyberspace. Holistic models of deception are needed in order to analyze interactions and to design mechanisms that improve them. Game theory provides such models. In particular, existing work models deception using signaling games. But signaling games inherently model deception that is undetectable. In this paper, we extend signaling games by including a detector that gives off probabilistic warnings when the sender acts deceptively. Then, we derive pooling and partially separating equilibria of the game. We find that: 1) high quality detectors eliminate some pure-strategy equilibria; 2) detectors with high true-positive rates encourage more honest signaling than detectors with low false-positive rates; 3) receivers obtain optimal outcomes for equal-error-rate detectors; and 4) surprisingly, deceptive senders sometimes benefit from highly accurate deception detectors. We illustrate these results with an application to defensive deception for network security. Our results provide a quantitative and rigorous analysis of the fundamental aspects of detectable deception.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Many image processing tasks can be formulated as translating images between two image domains such as colorization, super-resolution, and conditional image synthesis. In most of these tasks, an input image may correspond to multiple outputs. However, current existing approaches only show minor stochasticity of the outputs. In this paper, we present a novel approach to synthesize diverse realistic images corresponding to a semantic layout. We introduce a diversity loss objective that maximizes the distance between synthesized image pairs and relates the input noise to the semantic segments in the synthesized images. Thus, our approach can not only produce multiple diverse images but also allow users to manipulate the output images by adjusting the noise manually. The experimental results show that images synthesized by our approach are more diverse than that of the current existing works and equipping our diversity loss does not degrade the reality of the base networks. Moreover, our approach can be applied to unpaired datasets.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Cross-camera label estimation from a set of unlabeled training data is an extremely important component in the unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) systems. With the estimated labels, the existing advanced supervised learning methods can be leveraged to learn discriminative re-ID models. In this paper, we utilize the graph matching technique for accurate label estimation due to its advantages in optimal global matching and intra-camera relationship mining. However, the graph structure constructed with non-learned similarity measurement cannot handle the large cross-camera variations, which leads to noisy and inaccurate label outputs. This paper designs a dynamic graph matching (DGM) framework, which improves the label estimation process by iteratively refining the graph structure with better similarity measurement learned from the intermediate estimated labels. In addition, we design a positive re-weighting strategy to refine the intermediate labels, which enhances the robustness against inaccurate matching output and noisy initial training data. To fully utilize the abundant video information and reduce false matchings, a co-matching strategy is further incorporated into the framework. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three video benchmarks demonstrate that DGM outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods and yields the competitive performance to fully supervised upper bounds.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Almost all conventional template-matching methods employ low-level image features to measure the similarity between a template image and a scene image using similarity measures, such as pixel intensity and pixel gradient. Although these methods have been widely used in many applications, they cannot simultaneously address all types of robustness challenges. In this paper, with the goal of simultaneously addressing the various challenges, we present a robust semantic template-matching (RSTM) approach. Inspired by the local binary descriptor, we propose a novel superpixel region binary descriptor (SRBD) to construct a multilevel semantic fusion feature vector for RSTM. SRBD uses a new kernel-distance-based simple linear iterative clustering method to extract the stable superpixels from the template image. Then, based on the average intensity difference between each superpixel region and its neighbors, the dominant gradient orientation of each superpixel can be obtained, and the semantic features of each superpixel can be described as the dominant orientation difference vector, which is coded as the rotation-invariant SRBD. In the offline matching phase, the fusion semantic feature vector of RSTM combines the multilevel SRBD features with different numbers of superpixels. In the online matching phase, to cope with rotation invariance, a marginal probability model is proposed and applied to locate the positions of template images in the scene image. Moreover, to accelerate computation, an image pyramid is employed. We conduct a series of experiments on a large dataset randomly selected from the MS COCO dataset to fully analyze the robustness of this approach. The experimental results show that RSTM simultaneously addresses rotation changes, scale changes, noise, occlusions, blur, nonlinear illumination changes, and deformation with high time efficiency while also outperforming the previous state-of-the-art template-matching methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In real-world applications, different kinds of learning and prediction errors are likely to incur different costs for the same system. Moreover, in practice, the cost label information is often available only for a few training samples. In a semi-supervised setting, label propagation is critical to infer the cost information for unlabeled training data. The existing methods typically conduct label propagation independently ahead of supervised cost-sensitive learning. The precomputed label information is kept fixed, which may become suboptimal in the subsequent learning process and hence degrade the overall system performance. In this paper, we develop a unified cost-sensitive framework for semi-supervised face recognition that can jointly optimize the inferred label information and the classifier in an iterative manner. Our experiments on face benchmark datasets demonstrate that in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods for label propagation and cost-sensitive learning, the proposed approach can significantly improve the overall system performance, especially in terms of classification errors associated with high costs.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Digital reconstruction of mechanically shredded documents has received increasing attention in the last years mainly for historical and forensics needs. Computational methods to solve this problem are highly desirable in order to mitigate the time-consuming human effort and to preserve document integrity. The reconstruction of strips-shredded documents is accomplished by horizontally splicing pieces so that the arising sequence (solution) is as similar as the original document. In this context, a central issue is the quantification of the fitting between the pieces (strips), which generally involves stating a function that associates a pair of strips to a real value indicating the fitting quality. This problem is also more challenging for text documents, such as business letters or legal documents, since they depict poor color information. The system proposed here addresses this issue by exploring character shapes as visual features for compatibility computation. Experiments conducted with real mechanically shredded documents showed that our approach outperformed in accuracy other popular techniques in the literature considering documents with (almost) only textual content.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The connected vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) and cloud computing technology allows entities in VANET to enjoy the advantageous storage and computing services offered by some cloud service provider. However, the advantages do not come free, since their combination brings many new security and privacy requirements for VANET applications. In this paper, we investigate the cloud-based road condition monitoring (RCoM) scenario, where the authority needs to monitor real-time road conditions with the help of a cloud server so that it could make sound responses to emergency cases timely. When some bad road condition is detected, e.g., some geologic hazard or accident happens, vehicles on site are able to report such information to a cloud server engaged by the authority. We focus on addressing three key issues in RCoM. First, the vehicles have to be authorized by some roadside unit before generating a road condition report in the domain and uploading it to the cloud server. Second, to guarantee the privacy against the cloud server, the road condition information should be reported in ciphertext format, which requires that the cloud server should be able to distinguish the reported data from different vehicles in ciphertext format for the same place without compromising their confidentiality. Third, the cloud server and authority should be able to validate the report source, i.e., to check whether the road conditions are reported by legitimate vehicles. To address these issues, we present an efficient RCoM scheme, analyze its efficiency theoretically, and demonstrate the practicality through experiments.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fractional-pel accurate motion is widely used in video coding. For subband coding, fractional-pel accuracy is challenging since it is difficult to handle the complex motion field with temporal transforms. In our previous work, we designed integer accurate motion-adaptive transforms (MAT) which can transform integer accurate motion-connected coefficients. In this paper, we extend the integer MAT to fractional-pel accuracy. The integer MAT allows only one reference coefficient to be the lowband coefficient. In this paper, we design the transform such that it permits multiple references and generates multiple lowband coefficients. In addition, our fractional-pel MAT can incorporate a general interpolation filter into the basis vector, such that the highband coefficient produced by the transform is the same as the prediction error from the interpolation filter. The fractional-pel MAT is always orthonormal. Thus, the energy is preserved by the transform. We compare the proposed fractional-pel MAT, the integer MAT, and the half-pel motion-compensated orthogonal transform (MCOT), while HEVC intra coding is used to encode the temporal subbands. The experimental results show that the proposed fractional-pel MAT outperforms the integer MAT and the half-pel MCOT. The gain achieved by the proposed MAT over the integer MAT can reach up to 1 dB in PSNR.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Hypergraph learning has been widely exploited in various image processing applications, due to its advantages in modeling the high-order information. Its efficacy highly depends on building an informative hypergraph structure to accurately and robustly formulate the underlying data correlation. However, the existing hypergraph learning methods are sensitive to non-Gaussian noise, which hurts the corresponding performance. In this paper, we present a noise-resistant hypergraph learning model, which provides superior robustness against various non-Gaussian noises. In particular, our model adopts low-rank representation to construct a hypergraph, which captures the globally linear data structure as well as preserving the grouping effect of highly correlated data. We further introduce a correntropy-induced local metric to measure the reconstruction errors, which is particularly robust to non-Gaussian noises. Finally, the Frobenious-norm-based regularization is proposed to combine with the low-rank regularizer, which enables our model to regularize the singular values of the coefficient matrix. By such, the non-zero coefficients are selected to generate a hyperedge set as well as the hyperedge weights. We have evaluated the proposed hypergraph model in the tasks of image clustering and semi-supervised image classification. Quantitatively, our scheme significantly enhances the performance of the state-of-the-art hypergraph models on several benchmark data sets.
