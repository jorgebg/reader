<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to the global environmental issues and energy crisis, the injection of renewable energy sources (RESs) into the power system is continuously increasing. As the interface between RESs and power grid, grid-tied inverters using MOSFET switches, without traditional line frequency transformers, show some potential advantages, in terms of low cost, high efficiency, and lightweight and small size. Among several proposed configurations, the Aalborg inverter was proposed as a new family of high efficiency MOSFET-switch-based hybrid source inverters. For a conventional &#x201c;half bridge&#x201d; type Aalborg inverter, due to the imbalance of two independent dc sources, the input dc energies may not be fully utilized, which may reduce the efficiency of whole system. In order to extract the maximum energy from two independent dc sources, a coupled-inductor-based &#x201c;half bridge&#x201d; type Aalborg inverter is proposed in this paper. The principle of operation is presented and demonstrated through equivalent circuits. The effectiveness of a new energy balancing technique has been validated through simulations and experiments on a 110 V/ 500 W prototype.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A nonisolated single-stage electronic lighting system with a high power factor for driving power light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is proposed in this paper. The presented topology is based on the integration of a bridgeless boost rectifier with a nonresonant half-bridge converter. Accurate steady-state analyses of the nonresonant- and resonant-based circuits are reported, serving as the basis for designing the lighting systems. The LEDs current is adjusted by means of frequency modulation, being the converter switches driven by complementary symmetrical signals. A small-signal analysis is detailed for the proposed nonresonant scheme, providing fundamental information regarding its dynamic behavior. Also, a step-by-step design procedure based on the performed mathematical analysis is elaborated, allowing the adequate design of the proposed lighting system. In order to confirm the validity and the feasibility of the proposed converter, experimental results for a 42-W, 127- ${rm{V}}_{{rm{rms}}}$, 50-kHz, 94.2&#x0025; peak efficiency prototype are presented.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The hybrid modulation strategy using both low-frequency square-wave modulation and high-frequency pulse-width modulation can extend the stable operating region of a cascaded H-bridge converter. However, it does not control accurately dc voltages of converter but balances them by charging or discharging dc capacitors based on the state of system, which could aggravate fluctuation of dc voltages. If cascaded H-bridge converter is used in photovoltaic field, the aggravated fluctuation on dc capacitor voltages will result in further losses in energy harvesting of solar cells. To address this issue, a modified hybrid modulation strategy is presented in this paper. When dc-bus measured voltages are close to their reference voltages, these H-bridges operate in a zero mode. Adding appropriate zero state can prevent grid current charging or discharging the dc capacitors whose voltages have already reached their control goals. Therefore, the proposed technique is capable of suppressing dc voltage fluctuation, and, thus, improving the output power of solar cells. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a robust coupled multiple sliding-mode control (CMSMC) method for tracking control of underactuated hovercraft systems with nonholonomic constraints and external disturbances. First, a friction model for the hovercraft, one of the main disturbance factors, is proposed by considering viscosity, and its validity is demonstrated through experiments. Second, a disturbance model in the actual hovercraft system is estimated using a least-square-estimation-based disturbance observer. Third, pseudo forces and pseudo heading direction angle for tracking control and disturbance compensation are proposed considering the characteristics of underactuated hovercraft systems. Fourth, coupled multiple sliding surfaces (CMSSs) are newly introduced in terms of the tracking errors between the pseudo control variables and actual ones, and then, a CMSMC-based controller is proposed so that the CMSSs converge to zero within finite time in the case of zero disturbance estimation errors. In this way, three posture variables of the hovercraft converge to reference ones using only two control inputs. Finally, stability analysis and verification by simulations and experiments show that both the pseudo control tracking errors and posture tracking errors are ultimately bounded and asymptotically converge to zero when disturbance estimation errors become zero.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>As for ripple-current mode control, it cannot achieve average current tracking, resulting in poor current accuracy and even current waveform distortion. Meanwhile, fast-scale instability may occur in some operating conditions. To solve these problems effectively, a current-ripple compensation (CRC) control technique is proposed in this paper. The error between the average of the controlled current and the reference current is compensated by certain compensation signal, achieving average current tracking while suppressing fast-scale instability. On this basis, the compensator in the outer-voltage loop is further simplified to a proportional part by introducing a rebuilt average reference current. The idea and design procedure of the proposed CRC control technique are discussed in detail. Accordingly, two available implementation schemes for the proposed CRC are presented, including slope compensated and parabolic compensated schemes. Finally, two application cases, respectively, to dc&#x2013;dc Buck converter and Boost PFC converter, are presented to verify the proposed CRC control technique.

<p>Energy management in electric grids with multiple energy sources, generators, storage devices, and interacting loads along with their complex behaviors requires grid wide control. Communication infrastructure that aggregates information from heterogeneous devices in the electric grid making the applications completely independent of physical connectivity is essential for building in the context of control applications. This investigation presents a semantic middleware that is used to implement a receding-horizon-based optimal power flow (OPF) in smart grids. The presence of renewable energy sources, storage systems, and loads dispersed all along the grid necessitates the use of grid wide control and a communication infrastructure to support it. To this extent, the proposed middleware will serve as the basis for representing various components of the power grid. It is enriched with intelligence by semantic annotation and ontologies that provide situation awareness and context discovery. The middleware deployment is demonstrated by implementing the receding horizon OPF in a network in Steinkjer, Norway. Our results demonstrate the advantages of both the middleware and the algorithm. Furthermore, the results prove the added flexibility obtained in the grid due to the addition of renewable energy and storage systems. The significant advantage of the proposed approach is that the real-time monitoring infrastructure is used for improving the flexibility, reliability, and efficiency of the grid.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Photovoltaics (PVs) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) could instigate voltage violation issues, if not controlled properly. Besides, these components highly contribute to economic efficiency of microgrids (MGs). Being motivated to enhance technical and economic issues, this study develops an energy management system that is able to coordinate voltage control devices, say under-load tap changers (ULTC), PVs, PEV aggregators, and dispatchable distributed generations (DDGs). Active and reactive power provisions of PEVs and DDGs along with voltage control of ULTC lessen the plausible violations. So, higher renewable energy is contributed by PVs and extra monetary saving is reflected. In this manner, augmented Epsilon-constraint method followed with fuzzy decision making is applied to operation cost and voltage deviation minimizations. The proposed approach is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear multiobjective problem and tested on a modified IEEE 33-bus medium-voltage MG. Results are discussed in depth.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The objective of visual servoing aims to control an object&#x0027;s motion with visual feedbacks and becomes popular recently. Problems of complex modeling and instability always exist in visual servoing methods. Moreover, there are few research works on selection of the servoing gain in image-based visual servoing (IBVS) methods. This paper proposes an IBVS method with Q-Learning, where the learning rate is adjusted by a fuzzy system. Meanwhile, a synthetic preprocess is introduced to perform feature extraction. The extraction method is actually a combination of a color-based recognition algorithm and an improved contour-based recognition algorithm. For dealing with underactuated dynamics of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a decoupled controller is designed, where the velocity and attitude are decoupled through attenuating the effects of underactuation in roll and pitch and two independent servoing gains, for linear and angular motion servoing, respectively, are designed in place of single servoing gain in traditional methods. For further improvement in convergence and stability, a reinforcement learning method, Q-Learning, is taken for adaptive servoing gain adjustment. The Q-Learning is composed of two independent learning agents for adjusting two serving gains, respectively. In order to improve the performance of the Q-Learning, a fuzzy-based method is proposed for tuning the learning rate. The results of simulations and experiments on control of UAVs demonstrate that the proposed method has better properties in stability and convergence than the competing methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The main feature of cyber-physical production systems is its adaptability. They adapt quickly to new requirements such as new products or product variants. Nowadays, a bottleneck is the automation system, for which high manual engineering efforts are needed: Today, on-site technicians write and rewrite automation software, configure real-time communication protocols and create system configurations consisting of machine timing, physical dimensions of products, sensitivity, and motor control accelerations and velocities. Cyber-physical production systems often solve this dilemma by relying on reusable software components, which are composed in the overall automation software. However, this solution comes with a price, reusable software components need free parameters to adjust to the individual production configurations. This paper addresses this central research question and presents a novel parameter estimation approach to choose automatically optimal system configurations for cyber-physical production systems. Different scenarios from discrete manufacturing plants are used to evaluate the solution approach.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>As a clinician, how do you best care for patients from a wide variety of backgrounds? Cultural diversity is not merely a matter of pluralism or multiculturalism; it is often accompanied by unequal or inadequate health care. Very often, cultural diversity and health disparity go hand in hand. As a response to such inequities, various forms of cultural competence training are now viewed as an essential curriculum component in medical education programmes and a key element of effective practice. However, these educational innovations have also come under fire.

<p>Our study shows that homeless populations, individuals with substance use disorders, sex workers, and imprisoned individuals experience extreme health inequities across a wide range of health conditions, with the relative effect of exclusion being greater in female individuals than male individuals. The high heterogeneity between studies should be explored further using improved data collection in population subgroups. The extreme health inequity identified demands intensive cross-sectoral policy and service action to prevent exclusion and improve health outcomes in individuals who are already marginalised.

The lesions had initially appeared as discrete or grouped papules, which then coalesced into plaques and nodules, especially in the axillae, over a period of 2 years. They were painless and asymptomatic, and the patient sought medical help only for cosmetic resions, particularly regarding the lesions on his face.
