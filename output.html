Pol III is predominantly regulated at the level of transcription initiation, and dysregulated Pol III activity is linked to diseases including cancer. Two independent studies in this issue, by Alessandro Vannini and colleagues and Christoph M&#252;ller and colleagues, describe electron cryo-microscopy structures of the yeast Pol III preinitiation complex, comprising the full 17-subunit Pol III and the three TFIIIB subunits (TBP, Brf1 and Bdp1) bound to promoter DNA in various functional states. The structures reveal the detailed mechanisms that underlie how Pol III is recruited to its target promoters and how promoter DNA is opened to form a stable transcription bubble, and also allow a comparison with the structures of Pol I and Pol II preinitiation complexes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nature/rss/current/~4/nZ9kS51RaY4" width="1" />

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a three-phase lines to single-phase coil planar contactless power transformer. The transformer has the primary consisting of three-phase line cables arrayed in parallel on a plane and the secondary of single-phase coil. The proposed transformer is studied for application to automatic guided vehicles (AGVs). Uniform power transfer that is independent of the position of the AGVs is an important issue for this transformer, because of the sparse arrangement of the primary lines. To ensure that the transformer achieves uniform power transfer, the structure and dimensions of the primary are studied using numerical analysis. Additionally, an equivalent model of the proposed transformer, which is applicable to the imbalanced conditions, is presented. The equivalent model proves analytically that balanced three-phase voltage and balanced three-phase current conditions, which can be created using appropriate circuit configurations, enable uniform power transfer. The results of experiments in which the prototype of the transformer is applied to the target AGV confirm that under balanced-current conditions, which can be generated using a three-phase LCL circuit, the proposed transformer can transfer sufficient uniform power to drive the AGV.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A substantial pulsation of the second-order harmonic current ripple with angular frequency  $2omega$ is reflected at the input of a single-phase inverter when loads are supplied at its output with angular frequency $omega$ . Moreover, this ripple back-propagates and injects into the source in the absence of a bulky dc-link passive filter, an active compensator or a suitable digital controller with a front-end converter in the two-stage converter. This paper proposes a new adaptive sliding mode control for a two-stage dc&#x2013;dc&#x2013;ac converter to reduce proliferation of ripple without compromising dynamic performance. The front-end boost converter in the considered two-stage converter interfaces a battery bank and single-phase inverter fed loads. The control shapes the output impedance of the boost converter to reduce the ripple component at battery input. Second, the proposed controller achieves good dynamic performance at line and load transients. A fast voltage recovery with small undershoot/overshoot can be achieved at transients using the proposed controller. The proposed technique is validated using a hardware of the 1-kW two-stage converter.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>High-speed robots are being applied more and more widely in the scenarios of aviation manufacturing, electronic packaging, and three-dimensional printing, etc. To achieve high speed, the robots are typically designed to be lightweight, hence suffer from undesired vibration, so that the dynamic performance would deteriorate. In light of this, this paper considers the dynamic modeling and active control of an emerging redundant parallel robot. First, the recursively dynamic model is modularly established by means of Lagrangian multipliers method. For completeness, the model of permanent magnet synchronous motor is further integrated with the model of mechanical system to formulate the electromechanically coupled dynamic model (ECDM). To facilitate dynamic control, the ECDM is cleverly projected into the null space of constraint Jacobian matrix eliminating the need to compute Lagrangian multipliers explicitly. Based on singular perturbation approach and Tikhonov theorem, the ECDM is decomposed into two subsystems in different timescales. On this basis, a nonlinear hybrid control scheme is proposed for both trajectory tracking and vibration suppression. Numerical simulations suggest that the nonlinear hybrid control exhibits overwhelming performance than the conventional joint-based proportional and differential feedback control.

<p>This paper is dealing with magnetic and thermal analysis coupling of a wound-rotor synchronous machine (WRSM) based on the equivalent circuit methods. The main objective of this work is to introduce the principles of both magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) and thermal equivalent circuit (TEC) models, as well as the importance of their coupling. The results of nonlinear MEC are compared to 2-D finite-element analysis results obtained by the magnetic field analysis software JMAG while the results of TEC coupled with MEC are compared with the experimental thermal test results.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The successful and safe operation of a serially connected battery pack necessitates dynamic energy equalizing to adjust each cell&#x0027;s state of charge (SOC) to the same level, since there exists energy imbalance among its cells. Bidirectional Modified &#x0106;uk converters are utilized as the cell equalizers due to their advantages of integrated infrastructure and modular design. Distinguished from the literature, the maximum allowed cell equalizing current is designed to vary with the change of the battery pack&#x0027;s external current rather than a constant to avoid the cell&#x0027;s current exceeding its limitation. With adaptive quasi-sliding mode observers designed for the cells&#x2019; SOC estimation, a discrete-time quasi-sliding-mode-based strategy with saturated equalizing current constraints is proposed to have the converters work together efficiently to achieve the cells&#x2019; SOC equalization. As analyzed in mathematical proofs and shown in experimental results, the cells&#x2019; actual SOC differences can converge to a tolerant range around the origin in a relatively short time under the designed SOC estimation-based cell balancing method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Energy management in electric grids with multiple energy sources, generators, storage devices, and interacting loads along with their complex behaviors requires grid wide control. Communication infrastructure that aggregates information from heterogeneous devices in the electric grid making the applications completely independent of physical connectivity is essential for building in the context of control applications. This investigation presents a semantic middleware that is used to implement a receding-horizon-based optimal power flow (OPF) in smart grids. The presence of renewable energy sources, storage systems, and loads dispersed all along the grid necessitates the use of grid wide control and a communication infrastructure to support it. To this extent, the proposed middleware will serve as the basis for representing various components of the power grid. It is enriched with intelligence by semantic annotation and ontologies that provide situation awareness and context discovery. The middleware deployment is demonstrated by implementing the receding horizon OPF in a network in Steinkjer, Norway. Our results demonstrate the advantages of both the middleware and the algorithm. Furthermore, the results prove the added flexibility obtained in the grid due to the addition of renewable energy and storage systems. The significant advantage of the proposed approach is that the real-time monitoring infrastructure is used for improving the flexibility, reliability, and efficiency of the grid.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Photovoltaics (PVs) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) could instigate voltage violation issues, if not controlled properly. Besides, these components highly contribute to economic efficiency of microgrids (MGs). Being motivated to enhance technical and economic issues, this study develops an energy management system that is able to coordinate voltage control devices, say under-load tap changers (ULTC), PVs, PEV aggregators, and dispatchable distributed generations (DDGs). Active and reactive power provisions of PEVs and DDGs along with voltage control of ULTC lessen the plausible violations. So, higher renewable energy is contributed by PVs and extra monetary saving is reflected. In this manner, augmented Epsilon-constraint method followed with fuzzy decision making is applied to operation cost and voltage deviation minimizations. The proposed approach is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear multiobjective problem and tested on a modified IEEE 33-bus medium-voltage MG. Results are discussed in depth.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The objective of visual servoing aims to control an object&#x0027;s motion with visual feedbacks and becomes popular recently. Problems of complex modeling and instability always exist in visual servoing methods. Moreover, there are few research works on selection of the servoing gain in image-based visual servoing (IBVS) methods. This paper proposes an IBVS method with Q-Learning, where the learning rate is adjusted by a fuzzy system. Meanwhile, a synthetic preprocess is introduced to perform feature extraction. The extraction method is actually a combination of a color-based recognition algorithm and an improved contour-based recognition algorithm. For dealing with underactuated dynamics of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a decoupled controller is designed, where the velocity and attitude are decoupled through attenuating the effects of underactuation in roll and pitch and two independent servoing gains, for linear and angular motion servoing, respectively, are designed in place of single servoing gain in traditional methods. For further improvement in convergence and stability, a reinforcement learning method, Q-Learning, is taken for adaptive servoing gain adjustment. The Q-Learning is composed of two independent learning agents for adjusting two serving gains, respectively. In order to improve the performance of the Q-Learning, a fuzzy-based method is proposed for tuning the learning rate. The results of simulations and experiments on control of UAVs demonstrate that the proposed method has better properties in stability and convergence than the competing methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The main feature of cyber-physical production systems is its adaptability. They adapt quickly to new requirements such as new products or product variants. Nowadays, a bottleneck is the automation system, for which high manual engineering efforts are needed: Today, on-site technicians write and rewrite automation software, configure real-time communication protocols and create system configurations consisting of machine timing, physical dimensions of products, sensitivity, and motor control accelerations and velocities. Cyber-physical production systems often solve this dilemma by relying on reusable software components, which are composed in the overall automation software. However, this solution comes with a price, reusable software components need free parameters to adjust to the individual production configurations. This paper addresses this central research question and presents a novel parameter estimation approach to choose automatically optimal system configurations for cyber-physical production systems. Different scenarios from discrete manufacturing plants are used to evaluate the solution approach.

This iconic rallying cry was originally made by actor Peter Finch, as news anchorman Howard Beale, in Paddy Chayefsky's 1976 film Network. The same cry is now echoing in the Lyttelton Theatre, at the UK's National Theatre in London, in a stage adaptation of the movie by Lee Hall. Under the direction of Belgian director Ivo van Hove, American actor Bryan Cranston makes his debut on the British stage in a pitch-perfect performance as Howard Beale.

<p>On July 14, 2015, Iran, the P5+1 countries (China, France, Russia, UK, USA, and Germany), and the European Union signed a landmark nuclear agreement that officially went into effect on Jan 16, 2016.1 Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA; also known as the Iran nuclear deal), Iran was to put severe limitations on its nuclear programme in exchange for the removal of international sanctions. After signing this agreement, Iranian scientists considered it an historic opportunity for the scientific community, and they became hopeful that lifting the sanctions could gradually help their scientific advancements in many ways.
