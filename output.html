<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We develop a novel technique to determine call provenance in anonymous VoIP
communications using acoustic side-channels. The technique exploits
location-attributable information embedded within audio speech data. The
victim's speech is exploited as an excitation signal, which is modulated (acted
upon) by the acoustic reflection characteristics of the victim's location. We
show that leading VoIP communication channels faithfully transfer this
information between sender-receiver pairs, enabling passive receivers to
extract a location fingerprint, to establish call provenance. To establish
provenance, a fingerprint is compared against a database of labelled
fingerprints to identify a match. The technique is fully passive and does not
depend on any characteristic background sounds, is speaker independent, and is
robust to lossy network conditions. Evaluation using a corpus of recordings of
VoIP conversations, over the Tor network, confirms that recording locations can
be fingerprinted and detected remotely with low false-positive rate.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Thanks to the advances in machine learning, data-driven analysis tools have
become valuable solutions for various applications. However, there still remain
essential challenges to develop effective data-driven methods because of the
need to acquire a large amount of data and to have sufficient computing power
to handle the data. In many instances these challenges are addressed by relying
on a dominant cloud computing vendor, but, although commercial cloud vendors
provide valuable platforms for data analytics, they can suffer from a lack of
transparency, security, and privacy-perservation. Furthermore, reliance on
cloud servers prevents applying big data analytics in environments where the
computing power is scattered. To address these challenges, a decentralize,
secure, and privacy-preserving computing paradigm is proposed to enable an
asynchronized cooperative computing process amongst scattered and untrustworthy
computing nodes that may have limited computing power and computing
intelligence. This paradigm is designed by exploring blockchain, decentralized
learning, homomorphic encryption, and software defined networking(SDN)
techniques. The performance of the proposed paradigm is evaluated via different
scenarios in the simulation section.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We present a novel method for publishing differentially private synthetic
attributed graphs. Unlike preceding approaches, our method is able to preserve
the community structure of the original graph without sacrificing the ability
to capture global structural properties. Our proposal relies on C-AGM, a new
community-preserving generative model for attributed graphs. We equip C-AGM
with efficient methods for attributed graph sampling and parameter estimation.
For the latter, we introduce differentially private computation methods, which
allow us to release community-preserving synthetic attributed social graphs
with a strong formal privacy guarantee. Through comprehensive experiments, we
show that our new model outperforms its most relevant counterparts in
synthesising differentially private attributed social graphs that preserve the
community structure of the original graph, as well as degree sequences and
clustering coefficients.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Mobile devices with rich features can record videos, traffic parameters or
air quality readings along user trajectories. Although such data may be
valuable, users are seldom rewarded for collecting them. Emerging digital
marketplaces allow owners to advertise their data to interested buyers. We
focus on geo-marketplaces, where buyers search data based on geo-tags. Such
marketplaces present significant challenges. First, if owners upload data with
revealed geo-tags, they expose themselves to serious privacy risks. Second,
owners must be accountable for advertised data, and must not be allowed to
subsequently alter geo-tags. Third, such a system may be vulnerable to
intensive spam activities, where dishonest owners flood the system with fake
advertisements. We propose a geo-marketplace that addresses all these concerns.
We employ searchable encryption, digital commitments, and blockchain to protect
the location privacy of owners while at the same time incorporating
accountability and spam-resilience mechanisms. We implement a prototype with
two alternative designs that obtain distinct trade-offs between trust
assumptions and performance. Our experiments on real location data show that
one can achieve the above design goals with practical performance and
reasonable financial overhead.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Thanks to the widespread deployment of TLS, users can access private data
over channels with end-to-end confidentiality and integrity. What they cannot
do, however, is prove to third parties the {\em provenance} of such data, i.e.,
that it genuinely came from a particular website. Existing approaches either
introduce undesirable trust assumptions or require server-side modifications.
</p>
<p>As a result, the value of users' private data is locked up in its point of
origin. Users cannot export their data with preserved integrity to other
applications without help and permission from the current data holder. Even the
value of public date on the web cannot be fully realized as there is no secure
way to relay it to systems without network connections, such as smart
contracts.
</p>
<p>We propose DECO (short for \underline{dec}entralized \underline{o}racle) to
address the above problems. DECO allows users to prove that a piece of data
accessed via TLS came from a particular website and optionally prove statements
about such data in zero-knowledge, keeping the data itself secret. DECO is the
first such system that works without trusted hardware or server-side
modifications.
</p>
<p>DECO can liberate data from centralized web-service silos, making it
accessible to a rich spectrum of applications. To demonstrate the power of
DECO, we implement three applications that are hard to achieve without it: a
private financial instrument using smart contracts, converting legacy
credentials to anonymous credentials, and verifiable claims against price
discrimination.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies a multilevel multiphase dc&#x2013;ac conversion system configured by a neutral-point-clamped converter fed by multiple battery packs connected in series. A virtual-vector modulation is selected and a state-of-charge (SoC) balancing control is designed to be able to employ the full battery bank capacity, even under different battery initial SoC values or different battery nominal capacities. The SoC balancing among battery packs is accomplished through the multilevel converter operation in a lossless manner, by simply distributing the dc-to-ac power flow among the batteries according to their SoC. A simple average system model is also presented, which allows performing very fast system simulations over long periods of time and serves as a convenient tool to tune the compensator parameters. The satisfactory performance of the proposed system configuration and control, which can be applied with any number of levels and phases, has been verified through simulations and experiments in a four-level three-phase dc&#x2013;ac converter fed by three lithium-ion battery packs. The results prove the feasibility and advantages of the proposed system configuration, which can be used to implement conversion systems with different specifications combining several instances of a standard battery pack and a standard power semiconductor device.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Current imbalance in multistring light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is a critical issue. It may cause overcurrent in one or more LED strings, leading to rapid degradation. In this paper, a mixed high-order compensation networks-based wireless power transfer system is proposed to generate multiple constant current outputs. It is composed of an LCC resonant network in the transmitting side, a series resonant network, and multiple CLC resonant rectifiers in the receiving side. The CLC resonant rectifiers are connected in parallel to form multiple independent output channels, and each channel is then connected to an LED string. Based on the analysis of the T resonant circuit and the modeling of coupling coils, multiple constant output currents can be derived. As a result, current balance can be achieved, which is very suitable for driving multistring LEDs. The proposed system also offers a modular, scalable, and maintenance-free design, which can significantly reduce the construction cost and the control complexity. In addition, the inverter in the transmitting side can achieve zero phase angle. A laboratory prototype with dual independent output currents is built to verify the proposed method. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical analysis.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a cable-driven exoskeleton device is developed for stroke patients to enable them to perform passive range of motion exercises and teleoperation rehabilitation of their impaired hands. Each exoskeleton finger is controlled by an actuator via two cables. The motions between the metacarpophalangeal and distal&#x002f;proximal interphalangeal joints are decoupled, through which the movement pattern is analogous to that observed in the human hand. A dynamic model based on the Lagrange method is derived to estimate how cable tension varies with the angular position of the finger joints. Two discernable phases are observed, each of which reflects the motion of the metacarpophalangeal and distal&#x002f;proximal interphalangeal joints. The tension profiles of exoskeleton fingers predicted by the Lagrange model are verified through a mechatronic integrated platform. The model can precisely estimate the tensions at different movement velocities, and it shows that the characteristics of two independent phases remain the same even for a variety of movement velocities. The feasibility for measuring resistance when manipulating a patient&#x0027;s finger is demonstrated in human experiments. Specifically, the net force required to move a subject&#x0027;s finger joints can be accounted for by the Lagrange model.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Oriented-plane curvature reproduction, the control of fingertip deformation by orientating a flat plate on contact points to generate a sensation of curvature, is one of the curvature reproduction methods with favorable effects. However, among the three geometric cues of curvature, only the zeroth- and first-order information is recovered with this method, whereas the second-order information (i.e., local curvature) is neglected due to the oriented plate&#x0027;s inherent characteristic of having a planar surface. The second-order information will change the contact length between the finger and the surface and thus affects the feeling. As a solution for this problem, this paper proposes to control the indentation depth of the finger pulp on the oriented plate such that the correct contact length is reproduced during the rendering. A finger wearable device is developed to control that indentation depth. Three psychophysical experiments are carried out and the results indicate that the second-order information plays a positive role in curvature rendering.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In a typical communication pipeline, images undergo a series of processing steps that can cause visual distortions before being viewed. Given a high quality reference image, a reference (R) image quality assessment (IQA) algorithm can be applied after compression or transmission. However, the assumption of a high quality reference image is often not fulfilled in practice, thus contributing to less accurate quality predictions when using stand-alone R IQA models. This is particularly common on social media, where hundreds of billions of user-generated photos and videos containing diverse, mixed distortions are uploaded, compressed, and shared annually on sites like Facebook, YouTube, and Snapchat. The qualities of the pictures that are uploaded to these sites vary over a very wide range. While this is an extremely common situation, the problem of assessing the qualities of compressed images against their pre-compressed, but often severely distorted (reference) pictures has been little studied. Towards ameliorating this problem, we propose a novel two-step image quality prediction concept that combines NR with R quality measurements. Applying a first stage of NR IQA to determine the possibly degraded quality of the source image yields information that can be used to quality-modulate the R prediction to improve its accuracy. We devise a simple and efficient weighted product model of R and NR stages, which combines a pre-compression NR measurement with a post-compression R measurement. This first-of-a-kind two-step approach produces more reliable objective prediction scores. We also constructed a new, first-of-a-kind dedicated database specialized for the design and testing of two-step IQA models. Using this new resource, we show that two-step approaches yield outstanding performance when applied to compressed images whose original, pre-compression quality covers a wide range of realistic distortion types and severities. The two-step concept is versatile as it can use -
ny desired R and NR components. We are making the source code of a particularly efficient model that we call 2stepQA publicly available at https://github.com/xiangxuyu/2stepQA. We are also providing the dedicated new two-step database free of charge at http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/twostep/index.html.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Image representation methods based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved the state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision tasks, such as image retrieval and person re-identification. We recognize that more discriminative feature embeddings can be learned with supervised deep metric learning and handcrafted features for image retrieval and similar applications. In this paper, we propose a new supervised deep feature embedding with a handcrafted feature model. To fuse handcrafted feature information into CNNs and realize feature embeddings, a general fusion unit is proposed (called Fusion-Net). We also define a network loss function with image label information to realize supervised deep metric learning. Our extensive experimental results on the Stanford online products&#x2019; data set and the in-shop clothes retrieval data set demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform the existing state-of-the-art methods of image retrieval by a large margin. Moreover, we also explore the applications of the proposed methods in person re-identification and vehicle re-identification; the experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Unpaired image-to-image translation problem aims to model the mapping from one domain to another with unpaired training data. Current works like the well-acknowledged Cycle GAN provide a general solution for any two domains through modeling injective mappings with a symmetric structure. While in situations where two domains are asymmetric in complexity, i.e., the amount of information between two domains is different, these approaches pose problems of poor generation quality, mapping ambiguity, and model sensitivity. To address these issues, we propose Asymmetric GAN (AsymGAN) to adapt the asymmetric domains by introducing an auxiliary variable (aux) to learn the extra information for transferring from the information-poor domain to the information-rich domain, which improves the performance of state-of-the-art approaches in the following ways. First, aux better balances the information between two domains which benefits the quality of generation. Second, the imbalance of information commonly leads to mapping ambiguity, where we are able to model one-to-many mappings by tuning aux, and furthermore, our aux is controllable. Third, the training of Cycle GAN can easily make the generator pair sensitive to small disturbances and variations while our model decouples the ill-conditioned relevance of generators by injecting aux during training. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed method both qualitatively and quantitatively on asymmetric situation, label-photo task, on Cityscapes and Helen datasets, and show many applications of asymmetric image translations. In conclusion, our AsymGAN provides a better solution for unpaired image-to-image translation in asymmetric domains.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we focus on restoring high-resolution facial images under noisy low-resolution scenarios. This problem is a challenging problem as the most important structures and details of captured facial images are missing. To address this problem, we propose a novel local patch-based face super-resolution (FSR) method via the joint learning of the contextual model. The contextual model is based on the topology consisting of contextual sub-patches, which provide more useful structural information than the commonly used local contextual structures due to the finer patch size. In this way, the contextual models are able to recover the missing local structures in target patches. In order to further strengthen the structural compensation function of contextual topology, we introduce the recognition feature as additional regularity. Based on the contextual model, we formulate the super-resolved procedure as a contextual joint representation with respect to the target patch and its adjacent patches. The high-resolution image is obtained by weighting contextual estimations. Both quantitative and qualitative validations show that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms.

<p>Institutional child abuse is particularly noxious in its betrayal of trust. On Aug 21, an Australian court dismissed an appeal against the conviction of child sexual abuse by Cardinal George Pell, once the third most senior Catholic cleric. However, the Catholic Church is not the only culpable institution. Australia's Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse (the final report was published in 2017) uncovered atrocities in residential, educational, religious, recreational, sports, and health-care institutions.

<p>Identifying the causes of acute lower respiratory infections is challenging in most clinical settings, especially so in hospitals in low-income and middle-income countries where bacteriology and other diagnostic services are scarce. The diseases encompassed within WHO's clinical definition of pneumonia include bacterial and viral pneumonia, acute viral bronchiolitis, and bacterial and viral bronchitis. These conditions can coexist and duel pathogens are common, especially in severely unwell children in low-resource settings.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A significant portion (ca. 40%) of the world's total energy is utilized in buildings. Cooling of large buildings worldwide is done by centrifugal chiller systems, where the compressors, pumps, and fans are driven by ac motors. These motors are energy hungry parts of the chiller. All-variable speed chillers, taking into account load variations, reduced the energy demand significantly compared to the constant speed ones. Induction motors (IMs) are commonly used in modern chillers. However, as the efficiency of the IM decreases with the speed, the overall efficiency drops, as the chiller operates most of the time in part-load condition. In this paper, SimulationX software is used to quantitatively investigate about the energy efficiency improvement by using synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) in all-variable speed centrifugal chillers. The system was tested for three distinct building load profiles. The results are judged in comparison with the state-of-the-art IE2 IMs. The results provide quantitative evidence that SynRM can significantly increase the energy efficiency in the chiller systems and has a big potential to substitute IMs in these applications.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel sensor-less switching method based on logic gates for a five-level packed U-cell (PUC5) converter. It comprises only two level-shifted triangular carriers and logic gates. Hence, the number of triangular carriers is halved and the switching states table is eliminated, which cause remarkable reduction in complexity of the proposed modulation method. Moreover, employing the proposed sensor-less switching method leads to decrease in the PUC5 capacitor value by a factor of carrier ratio, fast self-balancing of the PUC5 capacitor voltage, and halving the output LC filter inductor and capacitor values in stand-alone mode, as well as the grid-link inductor value in grid-connected mode. In addition, the PUC5 converter start-up transient time is considerably decreased and the first switching harmonic cluster frequency is doubled, which lead to notable improvement of steady-state and dynamic performances of the PUC5 converter. The proposed sensor-less switching method has been implemented in both stand-alone and grid-connected operating modes of PUC5 converter. Provided simulation and experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed sensor-less switching method as well as its improved dynamic and steady-state performances in both stand-alone and grid-connected modes.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Participatory sensing is a crowdsourcing-based framework, where the platform executes the sensing requests with the help of many common peoples' handheld devices (typically smartphones). In this paper, we mainly address the online sensing request admission and smartphone selection problem to maximize the profit of the platform, taking into account the queue backlog, and the location of sensing requests and smartphones. First, we formulate this problem as a discrete time model and design a location aware online admission and selection control algorithm (LAAS) based on the Lyapunov optimization technique. The LAAS algorithm only depends on the currently available information and makes all the control decisions independently and simultaneously. Next, we utilize the recent advancement of the accurate prediction of smartphones' mobility and sensing request arrival information in the next few time slots and develop a predictive location aware admission and selection control algorithm (PLAAS). We further design a greedy predictive location aware admission and selection control algorithm (GPLAAS) to achieve the online implementation of PLAAS approximately and iteratively. Theoretical analysis shows that under any control parameter V &gt; 0, both LAAS and PLAAS algorithm can achieve O(1/V)-optimal average profit, while the sensing request backlog is bounded by O(V). Extensive numerical results based on both synthetic and real trace show that LAAS outperforms the Greedy algorithm and Random algorithm and GPLAAS improves the profit-backlog tradeoff over LAAS.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To contest the rapidly developing cyber-attacks, numerous collaborative security schemes, in which multiple security entities can exchange their observations and other relevant data to achieve more effective security decisions, are proposed and developed in the literature. However, the security-related information shared among the security entities may contain some sensitive information and such information exchange can raise privacy concerns, especially when these entities belong to different organizations. With such consideration, the interplay between the attacker and the collaborative entities is formulated as Quantitative Information Flow (QIF) games, in which the QIF theory is adapted to measure the collaboration gain and the privacy loss of the entities in the information sharing process. In particular, three games are considered, each corresponding to one possible scenario of interest in practice. Based on the game-theoretic analysis, the expected behaviors of both the attacker and the security entities are obtained. In addition, the simulation results are presented to validate the analysis.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security of a full-duplex base station (BS)-aided system in the worst case, where an uplink transmitter (UT) and a downlink receiver (DR) are equipped with a single antenna, while a powerful eavesdropper is equipped with multiple antennas. For securing the confidentiality of signals transmitted from the BS and UT, an artificial noise (AN)-aided secrecy beamforming scheme is proposed, which is robust to the realistic imperfect state information of both the eavesdropping channel and the residual self-interference channel. Our objective function is that of maximizing the worst-case sum secrecy rate achieved by the BS and UT, through jointly optimizing the beamforming vector of the confidential signals and the transmit covariance matrix of the AN. However, the resulting optimization problem is non-convex and non-linear. In order to efficiently obtain the solution, we transform the non-convex problem into a sequence of convex problems by adopting the block coordinate descent algorithm. We invoke a linear matrix inequality for finding its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution. In order to evaluate the achievable performance, the worst-case secrecy rate is analytically derived. Furthermore, we construct another secrecy transmission scheme using the projection matrix theory for performance comparison. Our simulation results show that the proposed robust secrecy transmission scheme achieves substantial secrecy performance gains, which verifies the efficiency of the proposed method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In cyberspace, evolutionary strategies are commonly used by both attackers and defenders. For example, an attacker's strategy often changes over the course of time, as new vulnerabilities are discovered and/or mitigated. Similarly, a defender's strategy changes over time. These changes may or may not be in direct response to a change in the opponent's strategy. In any case, it is important to have a set of quantitative metrics to characterize and understand the effectiveness of attackers' and defenders' evolutionary strategies, which reflect their cyber agility. Despite its clear importance, few systematic metrics have been developed to quantify the cyber agility of attackers and defenders. In this paper, we propose the first metric framework for measuring cyber agility in terms of the effectiveness of the dynamic evolution of cyber attacks and defenses. The proposed framework is generic and applicable to transform any relevant, quantitative, and/or conventional static security metrics (e.g., false positives and false negatives) into dynamic metrics to capture dynamics of system behaviors. In order to validate the usefulness of the proposed framework, we conduct case studies on measuring the evolution of cyber attacks and defenses using two real-world datasets. We discuss the limitations of the current work and identify future research directions.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The deployment of smart hybrid heat pumps (SHHPs) can introduce considerable benefits to electricity systems via smart switching between electricity and gas while minimizing the total heating cost for each individual customer. In particular, the fully optimized control technology can provide flexible heat that redistributes the heat demand across time for improving the utilization of low-carbon generation and enhancing the overall energy efficiency of the heating system. To this end, an accurate quantification of the preheating is of great importance to characterize the flexible heat. This paper proposes a novel data-driven preheating quantification method to estimate the capability of the heat pump demand shifting and isolate the effect of interventions. Varieties of fine-grained data from a real-world trial are exploited to estimate the baseline heat demand using Bayesian deep learning while jointly considering epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. A comprehensive range of case studies are carried out to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed quantification method, and then, the estimated demand shift is used as an input into the whole-system model to investigate the system implications and quantify the range of benefits of rolling out the SHHPs developed by PassivSystems to the future GB electricity systems.

<p>Obtaining an appropriate model is very crucial to develop an efficient energy management system for the smart home, including photovoltaic (PV) array, plug-in electric vehicle (PEV), home loads, and heat pump (HP). Stochastic modeling methods of smart homes explain random parameters and uncertainties of the aforementioned components. In this paper, a concise yet comprehensive analysis and comparison are presented for these techniques. First, modeling methods are implemented to find appropriate and precise forecasting models for PV, PEV, HP, and home load demand. Then, the accuracy of each model is validated by the real measured data. Finally, the pros and cons of each method are discussed and reviewed. The obtained results show the conditions under which the methods can provide a reliable and accurate description of smart home dynamics.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>At present, the fusion of different unimodal biometrics has attracted increasing attention from researchers, who are dedicated to the practical application of biometrics. In this paper, we explored a multi-biometric algorithm that integrates palmprints and dorsal hand veins (DHV). Palmprint recognition has a rather high accuracy and reliability, and the most significant advantage of DHV recognition is the biopsy (Liveness detection). In order to combine the advantages of both and implement the fusion method, deep learning and graph matching were, respectively, introduced to identify palmprint and DHV. Upon using the deep hashing network (DHN), biometric images can be encoded as 128-bit codes. Then, the Hamming distances were used to represent the similarity of two codes. Biometric graph matching (BGM) can obtain three discriminative features for classification. In order to improve the accuracy of open-set recognition, in multi-modal fusion, the score-level fusion of DHN and BGM was performed and authentication was provided by support vector machine (SVM). Furthermore, based on DHN, all four levels of fusion strategies were used for multi-modal recognition of palmprint and DHV. Evaluation experiments and comprehensive comparisons were conducted on various commonly used datasets, and the promising results were obtained in this case where the equal error rates (EERs) of both palmprint recognition and multi-biometrics equal 0, demonstrating the great superiority of DHN in biometric verification.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Touchless palmprint recognition systems enable high-accuracy recognition of individuals through less-constrained and highly usable procedures that do not require the contact of the palm with a surface. To perform this recognition, methods based on local texture descriptors and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are currently used to extract highly discriminative features while compensating for variations in scale, rotation, and illumination in biometric samples. In particular, the main advantage of CNN-based methods is their ability to adapt to biometric samples captured with heterogeneous devices. However, the current methods rely on either supervised training algorithms, which require class labels (e.g., the identities of the individuals) during the training phase, or filters pretrained on general-purpose databases, which may not be specifically suitable for palmprint data. To achieve a high-recognition accuracy with touchless palmprint samples captured using different devices while neither requiring class labels for training nor using pretrained filters, we introduce PalmNet, which is a novel CNN that uses a newly developed method to tune palmprint-specific filters through an unsupervised procedure based on Gabor responses and principal component analysis (PCA), not requiring class labels during training. PalmNet is a new method of applying Gabor filters in a CNN and is designed to extract highly discriminative palmprint-specific descriptors and to adapt to heterogeneous databases. We validated the innovative PalmNet on several palmprint databases captured using different touchless acquisition procedures and heterogeneous devices, and in all cases, a recognition accuracy greater than that of the current methods in this paper was obtained.
