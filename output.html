<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University and the FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology (IFOM) in Italy have succeeded in depleting AND-1, a key protein for DNA replication, by using a recently developed conditional protein degradation system. Consequently, they were able to gain unprecedented access to the mechanism behind how AND-1 works during DNA replication and cell proliferation in vertebrate cells, demonstrating that AND-1 has two different functions during DNA replication mediated by different domains of AND-1.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A new ovarian cancer study could help to better match patients with the appropriate therapy for their cancer.  The research identified important epigenetic differences among ovarian cancer patients that could influence their response to treatment. There is no 'one size fits all' approach for treating ovarian cancer so being able to offer personalised care is crucial for patient survival rates which have seen little improvement over 30 years.

<p>Mortality rates in Russia decreased for non-communicable diseases and all other major causes of death between 1980 and 2016 according to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2016 Study by the GBD 2016 Russian Collaborators,1 published in The Lancet. As the prevalence of the most important risk factor according to this study&#8212;high blood pressure&#8212;increased over the past decades,2 these achievements seem to be primarily due to substance control policies, specifically WHO's so-called best buys,3 which resulted in marked declines in tobacco4 and&#8212;more importantly for Russia&#8212;alcohol use.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Once a central focus of global development goals, the field of women's, children's, and adolescents' health has now been pushed to the margins of international concern. Maternal and child health advocates have been victims of their own success. Steep declines in under-5 mortality and steady progress in reducing maternal mortality have suggested the job is done. While advances in reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health should be celebrated, this week's report by the Independent Accountability Panel for Women's, Children's, and Adolescents' Health (IAP) proves that such complacency is a grave mistake.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In 1913, in the Coyoac&#225;n district of Mexico City, the 6-year old Magdalena Carmen Frieda Kahlo y Calder&#243;n contracted poliomyelitis, enduring a convalescence of 9 months. About 8500 people across the USA were to die as a result of the polio epidemics that raged between 1913 and 1916. Although the child was lucky to have survived, she contracted paralytic poliomyelitis, as a result of which the muscles of her right leg lost their function. Her limb became emaciated and the foot stunted, and as she grew, its failure to develop led to an imbalance in her pelvis and a curvature of her spine.

<p>In the TRIBUTE study,1 Alberto Papi and colleagues (March 17, p 1076) reported a small but significant reduction of the exacerbation rate with the addition of an inhaled corticosteroid to dual long-acting bronchodilation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and severe or very severe airway obstruction with at least one exacerbation in the previous year. Data derived from the ISOLDE study2 showed that abruptly stopping treatment with inhaled corticosteroid was associated with an increased risk of exacerbation in about 25% of patients, with a median delay of 20 days.

These data are from a randomized clinical trial conducted by the makers of fosfomycin in the 1990s. The data were evaluated extensively by the US Food and Drug Administration, which had to send a warning letter to the company because it was selectively advertising fosfomycin&#8217;s &#8220;successful clinical cure rate in over 700 women&#8221; of 70% without disclosing that the women were enrolled in a comparative trial in which the success rates for ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were 96% and 94%, respectively. The trial sponsor&#8217;s decision never to publish these results is not surprising, but lack of publication does not mean that the data are not valid. The narrative reviews cited by Barros included only published articles, inflating fosfomycin&#8217;s presumed success rate.</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In 2015, NIST held a workshop calling for new candidates for the next generation of elliptic curves to replace the almost two-decade old NIST curves. Nothing Upon My Sleeves (NUMS) curves are among the potential candidates presented in the workshop. Here, we present the first implementation of the NUMS256, NUMS379, and NUMS384 curves on two types of embedded devices. The implementations, which exhibit regular, constant-time execution to protect against timing and simple side-channel attacks, set new speed records and advance the state-of-the-art of curve-based (without endomorphism) scalar multiplication on 8-bit AVR and 32-bit ARM11 microcontrollers. For example, our NUMS256 implementation computes a scalar multiplication in &#x007e;1.4 million cycles on a low-power 32-bit ARM11 microcontroller using mixed C and assembly language. These results demonstrate the potential of deploying IoT-NUMS on constrained and low-power applications such as protocols for the Internet of Things.

<p>Conventional password-based authentication is considered inadequate by users as many online services started to affect each other. Online credentials are used to recover other credentials and complex attacks are directed to the weakest one of many of these online credentials. As researchers are looking for new authentication techniques, one time passwords, which is a two-factor authentication scheme, looks like a natural enhancement over conventional username/password schemes. The manuscript places the OTP verifier to the cloud to ease adoption of its usage by cloud service providers. When the OTP verifier is placed on the cloud as a service, other cloud service providers could outsource their OTP deployments as well as cloud users could activate their respective account on the OTP provider on several cloud services. This enables them to use several cloud services without the difficulty of managing several OTP accounts for each cloud service. On the other hand, OTP service provision saves inexperienced small to medium enterprises from spending extra costs for OTP provisioning hardware, software, and employers. The paper outlines architecture to build a secure, privacy-friendly, and sound OTP provider in the cloud to outsource the second factor of authentication. Cloud user registration to OTP provider, service provider activation, and authentication phases are inspected. The security and privacy considerations of the proposed architecture are defined and analyzed. Attacks from outsiders, unlinkability properties of user profiles, attacks from curious service providers or OTP verifiers are mitigated within the given assumptions. The proposed solution, which locates the OTP provider in the cloud, is rendered robust and sound as a result of the analysis.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In video surveillance, face recognition (FR) systems are employed to detect individuals of interest appearing over a distributed network of cameras. The performance of still-to-video FR systems can decline significantly because faces captured in unconstrained operational domain (OD) over multiple video cameras have a different underlying data distribution compared to faces captured under controlled conditions in the enrollment domain with a still camera. This is particularly true when individuals are enrolled to the system using a single reference still. To improve the robustness of these systems, it is possible to augment the reference set by generating synthetic faces based on the original still. However, without the knowledge of the OD, many synthetic images must be generated to account for all possible capture conditions. FR systems may, therefore, require complex implementations and yield lower accuracy when training on many less relevant images. This paper introduces an algorithm for domain-specific face synthesis (DSFS) that exploits the representative intra-class variation information available from the OD. Prior to operation (during camera calibration), a compact set of faces from unknown persons appearing in the OD is selected through affinity propagation clustering in the captured condition space (defined by pose and illumination estimation). The domain-specific variations of these face images are then projected onto the reference still of each individual by integrating an image-based face relighting technique inside the 3-D reconstruction framework. A compact set of synthetic faces is generated that resemble individuals of interest under the capture conditions relevant to the OD. In a particular implementation based on sparse representation classification, the synthetic faces generated with the DSFS are employed to form a cross-domain dictionary that accounts for structured sparsity, where the dictionary blocks combine the original and synthetic faces o-
 each individual. Experimental results obtained with videos from the Chokepoint and COX-S2V data sets reveal that augmenting the reference gallery set of still-to-video FR systems using the proposed DSFS approach can provide a significantly higher level of accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, with only a moderate increase in its computational complexity.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we present a new approach for counterfeit protection against remarked, overproduced, and out-of-spec integrated circuits (ICs). Our approach uses identification sequences that are regularly published by the original chip manufacturer and hidden in the electromagnetic (EM) leakage of authentic chips. A portion of the chip area is dedicated to a crypto engine running in stream cipher mode that is initialized with a unique key and an initialization vector stored in one-time-programmable antifuse memory. IC identification is carried out in the field by obtaining EM measurements of deployed ICs and by proving the presence of the genuine identification sequences in the measurements. We evaluate our approach using a proof-of-concept implementation on three FPGA boards by capturing EM leakage of the FPGAs under test at their decoupling capacitors. The results show that the user can carry out IC identification on-site, using standard lab equipment in short amount of time.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Privacy preservation is addressed for decentralized optimization, where $N$ agents cooperatively minimize the sum of $N$ convex functions private to these individual agents. In most existing decentralized optimization approaches, participating agents exchange and disclose states explicitly, which may not be desirable when the states contain sensitive information of individual agents. The problem is more acute when adversaries exist which try to steal information from other participating agents. To address this issue, we propose a privacy-preserving decentralized optimization approach based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and partially homomorphic cryptography. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that cryptographic techniques are incorporated in a fully decentralized setting to enable privacy preservation in decentralized optimization in the absence of any third party or aggregator. To facilitate the incorporation of encryption in a fully decentralized manner, we introduce a new ADMM, which allows time-varying penalty matrices and rigorously prove that it has a convergence rate of $O(1/t)$ . Numerical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness and low-computational complexity of the proposed approach.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a new method to identify the mechanical parameters of a servo drive system, such as the moment of inertia and friction torque coefficients. Identification of the moment of inertia is essential for the design of a high-performance speed and position controller. Furthermore, the mechanical friction torque coefficients, such as the viscous and Coulomb friction torque coefficients, can be used to reduce the speed and position error without resorting to the use of a high gain for the speed controller. To simultaneously identify the moment of inertia and the friction torque coefficients, the proposed method uses the fact that the sinusoidal speed is in phase with the friction torque and out of phase with the torque for the moment of inertia. The proposed method is based on the speed control loop and the moment of inertia, and friction torque coefficients can be exactly obtained from a half-period integration of the torque reference of the low frequency sinusoidal speed control. Using computer simulations and experiments employing 600-W servo drive systems, the feasibility of the proposed method was verified.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In a sensorless vector control method, at low speeds and self-commissioning for AC motors, it is necessary to model dead time, rise&#x002f;fall time, parasitic capacitors, and semiconductors&#x2019; voltage drop accurately. In this paper, voltage drop in each phase due to the nonlinear behavior of the inverter from the control system&#x0027;s viewpoint is precisely modeled by using two lookup tables. These lookup tables make the proposed model robust against the dc-link voltage and carrier frequency variations in the entire current range. In conventional methods at standstill, the measured voltage in the dc current test contains the nonlinearity of two phases. Therefore, to obtain the nonlinear voltage of each inverter phase, it is assumed that the values of inverter nonlinearity voltage at both high current and low current are equal. This simplification leads to distortion in measured voltage in the low currents. However, in this paper, the voltage drop equation of each phase is solved by numerical method that is realizable in conventional processors. The results obtained in actual voltage measurement show the superiority of the proposed method over traditional methods in the low currents. The proposed method is verified by using a voltage source inverter feeding a 2.2-kW three-phase induction motor.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a new control strategy for single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) converters is proposed. The strategy is based on the hybrid control scheme. Switched linear equations of the converter are used in the design procedure. As a result, the cross regulation is suppressed inherently. A minimum dwell-time constraint is considered to suppress the switching loss and electromagnetic interference. The proposed scheme can control both minimum phase and nonminimum phase SIMO converters. It will be shown that the system is robust to input voltage and load variations. In order to compare the results, a recent pulsewidth-modulation-based control system is considered. Performance of the system is evaluated by a number of simulations and experiments.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The problem of codesign or simultaneous synthesis of triggering and input policies is investigated. The policies are synthesized to minimize a cost function incorporating a data transmission cost. This is unlike the common practice of utilizing an a priori-designed stabilizing control policy and designing a triggering policy, which retains stability. Initially, a finite-horizon cost function that penalizes the state, the control input, and each data transmission is selected. The optimal actions comprised of the control input and the triggering decision, under the operation choice of zero-order hold (ZOH), are approximately obtained in a feedback form, using adaptive dynamic programming. Afterward, the design is extended to the case of generalized ZOH, where the last transmitted state information is updated using a possibly imperfect model. Extension to infinite-horizon cost functions is presented. After analysis of convergence and optimality, the performance of the method is demonstrated through some numerical examples.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Time-to-failure (TTF) prognostic plays a crucial role in predicting remaining lifetime of electrical machines for improving machinery health management. This paper presents a novel three-step degradation data-driven TTF prognostics approach for rolling element bearings (REBs) in electrical machines. In the degradation feature extraction step, multiple degradation features, including statistical features, intrinsic energy features, and fault frequency features, are extracted to detect the degradation phenomenon of REBs using complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise and Hilbert&#x2013;Huang transform methods. In degradation feature reduction step, the degradation features, which are monotonic, robust, and correlative to the fault evolution of the REBs, are selected and fused into a principal component Mahalanobis distance health index using dynamic principal component analysis and Mahalanobis distance methods. In TTF prediction step, the degradation process and local TTF of the REBs are observed by an exponential regression-based local degradation model, and the global TTF is predicted by an empirical Bayesian algorithm with a continuous update. A practical case study involving run-to-failure experiments of REBs on PRONOSTIA platform is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and to show a more accurate prediction of TTF than the existing major approaches.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>An error in a power system protection scheme can result in unwanted tripping of healthy lines or delay in the removal of a fault from the network, thus affecting the power system stability. Online identification of such an error provides scope to initiate remedial measures, thereby preventing possible cascade tripping situations. In this paper, a method for real-time analysis of protection decision in a power system is proposed. This method identifies the relay, which has maloperated for an event in the network. For analysis of a relay operation, synchrophasor data from selected locations are obtained depending on the network topology. A function is developed utilizing indices calculated from the synchronized data. Based on the calculated value of the function during an event, the correctness of the protection decision is validated. Results obtained from PSCAD/EMTDC simulations for the New England 39-bus system demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>One of the fundamental and challenging issues in microgrids is to guarantee fairness of load sharing while realizing voltage regulation of distributed generations. In order to address this issue, a new multiobjective optimization problem with tunable weighting coefficients is first formulated for dc microgrids. Second, a new distributed control scheme, which only requires local communications among neighbors, is proposed to solve the optimization problem. It is theoretically proved that the distributed control scheme can exponentially achieve the global optimal outputs of voltages and currents at distributed generations. Compared with a centralized control scheme, the proposed distributed control scheme provides remarkable advantages in improving reliability and scalability of microgrids. Third, the distributed control scheme is extended to accommodate a constant communication delay. The effects of the communication delay on the stability of microgrids are explicitly characterized. Finally, the performance of the proposed control schemes is evaluated by a modified six-bus microgrid with dc-powered trolleybus systems in terms of their convergence, robustness to load variations, plug-and-play functionality, tradeoff ability, and effects of communication delays.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Air quality is currently arousing drastically increasing attention from the governments and populace all over the world. In this paper, we propose a heuristic recurrent air quality predictor (RAQP) to infer air quality. The RAQP exploits some key meteorology- and pollution-related variables to infer air pollutant concentrations (APCs), e.g. the fine particulate matter (PM2.5). It is natural that the meteorological factors and APCs at the current time have strong influences on air quality the next adjacent moment, that is to say, there exist high correlations between them. With this consideration, applying simple machine learners to the current meteorology- and pollution-related factors can reliably predict the air quality indices at a time later. However, owing to the nonlinear and chaotic reasons, the above correlations decline with the time interval enlarged. In such cases, it fails to forecast the air quality after several hours by only using simple machine learners and the current measurements of meteorology- and pollution-related variables. To solve the problem, our RAQP method recurrently applies the 1-h prediction model, which learns the current records of meteorology- and pollution-related factors to predict the air quality 1 h later, to then estimate the air quality after several hours. Via extensive experiments, results confirm that the RAQP predictor is superior to the relevant state-of-the-art techniques and nonrecurrent methods when applied to air quality prediction.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Wireless communication technologies have become widely adopted, appearing in heterogeneous applications ranging from tracking victims, responders, and equipment in disaster scenarios to machine health monitoring in networked manufacturing industries. These systems are said to have real-time timeliness requirements since data communication must be conducted within predefined temporal bounds, whose unfulfillment may compromise the correct behavior of the system and cause economic losses or endanger human lives. The support of real-time communications over license-free bands in open environments is a challenging task since real-time medium access is only achieved by a strict timing control of all communicating stations (real and nonreal-time). However, in open communication environments, the traffic generated by uncontrolled stations cannot be avoided by existing medium access protocols. In this paper, the definition, implementation, and assessment of a novel MAC technique named bandjacking is performed. Results demonstrate that the support of low-power deterministic communications is possible in open environments by using bandjacking.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A stochastic model predictive controller (SMPC) of air conditioning (AC) system is proposed to improve the energy efficiency of electric vehicles (EVs). A Markov-chain based velocity predictor is adopted to provide a sense of the future disturbances over the SMPC control horizon. The sensitivity of electrified AC plant to solar radiation, ambient temperature, and relative air flow speed is quantificationally analyzed from an energy efficiency perspective. Three control approaches are compared in terms of the electricity consumption, cabin temperature, and comfort fluctuation, which include the proposed SMPC method, a generally used bang-bang controller, and dynamic programming as the benchmark. Real solar radiation and ambient temperature data are measured to validate the effectiveness of the SMPC. Comparison results illustrate that SMPC is able to improve the AC energy economy by 12&#x0025; compared to the rule-based controller. The cabin temperature variation is reduced by more than 50.4&#x0025;, resulting with a much better cabin comfort.
