<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep learning has made tremendous advances in computer vision tasks such as
image classification. However, recent studies have shown that deep learning
models are vulnerable to specifically crafted adversarial inputs that are
quasi-imperceptible to humans. In this work, we propose a novel approach to
defending adversarial attacks. We employ an input processing technique based on
denoising autoencoders as a defense. It has been shown that the input
perturbations grow and accumulate as noise in feature maps while propagating
through a convolutional neural network (CNN). We exploit the noisy feature maps
by using an additional subnetwork to extract image feature maps and train an
auto-encoder on perceptual losses of these feature maps. This technique
achieves close to state-of-the-art results on defending MNIST and CIFAR10
datasets, but more importantly, shows a new way of employing a defense that
cannot be trivially trained end-to-end by the attacker. Empirical results
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on the MNIST and CIFAR10
datasets on simple as well as iterative LP attacks. Our method can be applied
as a preprocessing technique to any off the shelf CNN.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Demand for smartwatches has taken off in recent years with new models which
can run independently from smartphones and provide more useful features,
becoming first-class mobile platforms. One can access online banking or even
make payments on a smartwatch without a paired phone. This makes smartwatches
more attractive and vulnerable to malicious attacks, which to date have been
largely overlooked. In this paper, we demonstrate Snoopy, a password extraction
and inference system which is able to accurately infer passwords entered on
Android/Apple watches within 20 attempts, just by eavesdropping on motion
sensors. Snoopy uses a uniform framework to extract the segments of motion data
when passwords are entered, and uses novel deep neural networks to infer the
actual passwords. We evaluate the proposed Snoopy system in the real-world with
data from 362 participants and show that our system offers a 3-fold improvement
in the accuracy of inferring passwords compared to the state-of-the-art,
without consuming excessive energy or computational resources. We also show
that Snoopy is very resilient to user and device heterogeneity: it can be
trained on crowd-sourced motion data (e.g. via Amazon Mechanical Turk), and
then used to attack passwords from a new user, even if they are wearing a
different model. This paper shows that, in the wrong hands, Snoopy can
potentially cause serious leaks of sensitive information. By raising awareness,
we invite the community and manufacturers to revisit the risks of continuous
motion sensing on smart wearable devices.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Operation technology networks, i.e. hard- and software used for monitoring
and controlling physical/industrial processes, have been considered immune to
cyber attacks for a long time. A recent increase of attacks in these networks
proves this assumption wrong. Several technical constraints lead to approaches
to detect attacks on industrial processes using available sensor data. This
setting differs fundamentally from anomaly detection in IT-network traffic and
requires new visualization approaches adapted to the common periodical behavior
in OT-network data. We present a tailored visualization system that utilizes
inherent features of measurements from industrial processes to full capacity to
provide insight into the data and support triage analysis by laymen and
experts. The novel combination of spiral plots with results from anomaly
detection was implemented in an interactive system. The capabilities of our
system are demonstrated using sensor and actuator data from a real-world water
treatment process with introduced attacks. Exemplary analysis strategies are
presented. Finally, we evaluate effectiveness and usability of our system and
perform an expert evaluation.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Password managers have the potential to help users more effectively manage
their passwords and address many of the concerns surrounding password-based
authentication, however prior research has identified significant
vulnerabilities in existing password managers. Since that time, five years has
passed, leaving it unclear whether password managers remain vulnerable or
whether they are now ready for broad adoption. To answer this question, we
evaluate thirteen popular password managers and consider all three stages of
the password manager lifecycle--password generation, storage, and autofill. Our
evaluation is the first analysis of password generation in password managers,
finding several non-random character distributions and identifying instances
where generated passwords were vulnerable to online and offline guessing
attacks. For password storage and autofill, we replicate past evaluations,
demonstrating that while password managers have improved in the half-decade
since those prior evaluations, there are still significant issues, particularly
with browser-based password managers; these problems include unencrypted
metadata, unsafe defaults, and vulnerabilities to clickjacking attacks. Based
on our results, we identify password managers to avoid, provide recommendations
on how to improve existing password managers, and identify areas of future
research.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep learning models are often trained on datasets that contain sensitive
information such as individuals' shopping transactions, personal contacts, and
medical records. An increasingly important line of work therefore has sought to
train neural networks subject to privacy constraints that are specified by
differential privacy or its divergence-based relaxations. These privacy
definitions, however, have weaknesses in handling certain important primitives
(composition and subsampling), thereby giving loose or complicated privacy
analyses of training neural networks. In this paper, we consider a recently
proposed privacy definition termed f-differential privacy [17] for a refined
privacy analysis of training neural networks. Leveraging the appealing
properties of f-differential privacy in handling composition and subsampling,
this paper derives analytically tractable expressions for the privacy
guarantees of both stochastic gradient descent and Adam used in training deep
neural networks, without the need of developing sophisticated techniques as [3]
did. Our results demonstrate that the f-differential privacy framework allows
for a new privacy analysis that improves on the prior analysis [3], which in
turn suggests tuning certain parameters of neural networks for a better
prediction accuracy without violating the privacy budget. These theoretically
derived improvements are confirmed by our experiments in a range of tasks in
image classification, text classification, and recommender systems.

<p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a borderless challenge, with drug-resistant infections estimated to cause at least 700&#8200;000 deaths per year globally.1 To address this, member states of WHO agreed to the Global Action Plan for AMR in 2015, followed by adoption of the UN political declaration on AMR in 2016. A global governance structure is in place&#8212;namely, the Tripartite, made up of WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), and the World Organisation of Animal Health (OIE)&#8212;all of which are strengthening their AMR mandates.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent advancements in radio frequency machine learning (RFML) have demonstrated the use of raw in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples for multiple spectrum sensing tasks. Yet, deep learning techniques have been shown, in other applications, to be vulnerable to adversarial machine learning (ML) techniques, which seek to craft small perturbations that are added to the input to cause a misclassification. The current work differentiates the threats that adversarial ML poses to RFML systems based on where the attack is executed from: direct access to classifier input, synchronously transmitted over the air (OTA), or asynchronously transmitted from a separate device. Additionally, the current work develops a methodology for evaluating adversarial success in the context of wireless communications, where the primary metric of interest is bit error rate and not human perception, as is the case in image recognition. The methodology is demonstrated using the well known Fast Gradient Sign Method to evaluate the vulnerabilities of raw IQ based Automatic Modulation Classification and concludes RFML is vulnerable to adversarial examples, even in OTA attacks. However, RFML domain specific receiver effects, which would be encountered in an OTA attack, can present significant impairments to adversarial evasion.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The variety of arc fault induced by different load types makes residential series arc fault detection complicated and challengeable. This paper proposes a hybrid time and frequency analysis and fully connected neural network (HTFNN) based method to identify series ac arc fault. The HTFNN method recognizes samples state by broadly classifying them into resistive (Re) category, capacitive&#x2013;inductive (CI) category, and switching (Sw) category according to the fundamental frequency components of series current. In each category, separate fully connected neural network (NN) with customized time and frequency indicators being the input is employed for fine class recognition and state identification. This method construction addresses the feature overlap among various cases by separate categories and enables suitable indicator selection within each category. Since the identification complexity in each category is cheaper than identifying all cases together, concise NNs are applied in this paper to reduce computing cost. The general accuracies of normal and arcing state identification in Re, CI, and Sw category are 99.64&#x0025;, 100&#x0025;, and 98.45&#x0025;, respectively, based on 3950 test samples. Method comparison shows that HTFNN achieves higher detection precision at lower computational complexity for generalized load types. This paper also evaluates the feasibility of implementing the method in hardware for arc fault detection device application.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Nowadays, production-oriented manufacturing is transforming to service-oriented one, which leads to an increasing demand for high reliability of manufacturing systems. However, a popular approach to measuring terminal reliability of complex networked systems is based on graph theory, which has been shown to be an NP-hard problem. Though the NP-hard problem can be avoided by employing a statistical measure method for terminal reliability of random networks based on percolation theory, there is still lack of a general assessment approach to calculating terminal reliability of heterogeneous complex networks in intelligent manufacturing. In this paper, we propose a novel fractal-based approach to measuring the terminal reliability of heterogeneous networks. With help of the renormalization procedure that coarse grains a network into boxes containing nodes within given lateral size and inverse renormalization, which gives a fractal network growth model, a fractal network approximation of an arbitrary complex network is obtained. This fractal network topology can be described by a superposition of fractal elements based on fractal theory. Following this description, terminal reliability is the function of reliability of fractal elements. Then, a reliability assessment algorithm with computational complexity $O(N^2)$ based on fractal elements is developed. Numerical simulation is performed on a real network and a fractal network to validate the effectiveness of our method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Job shop scheduling always plays an important role in the manufacturing process and is one of the decisive factors influencing manufacturing efficiency. In the actual process of production scheduling, there exist some uncertain events, information asymmetry, and abnormal disturbance, which would cause the execution deviation and affect the efficiency and quality of scheduling execution. Traditional scheduling methods are not sufficient to solve the challenges well. Due to the rise of digital twin, which has the characters of virtual reality interaction, real-time mapping, and symbiotic evolution, a new job shop scheduling method based on digital twin is proposed to reduce the scheduling deviation. In this article, the architecture and working principle of the new job shop scheduling mode are introduced. Then, scheduling resource parameter updating methods and dynamic interactive scheduling strategies are proposed to achieve real-time and precise scheduling. Finally, a prototype system is designed to verify the validity of this new job shop scheduling mode.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The accuracy of power electronics simulation relies on the semiconductor switch model employed. Thus, in this paper where an ultrafast mechatronic circuit breaker (UFMCB) is implemented in real-time on the field programmable gate array, a detailed nonlinear thyristor model is proposed for extra device-level information regarding design evaluation. The cascaded thyristors impose a heavy computational burden on the UFMCB simulation, and node elimination is achieved following the proposal of a scalable thyristor model. For the convenience of the circuit breaker's integration into dc grid, a pair of coupled voltage-current sources is inserted as its interface, which achieves a reduction in the dimension of system admittance matrix, and the subsequent proposal of a relaxed scalar Newton-Raphson method further expedites the simulation by decomposing the nodal matrix equation. Meanwhile, the modular multilevel converter as a dc grid terminal adopts half-bridge and clamped double submodule topologies to test system performance in conjunction with the UFMCB. Real-time execution is achieved and the results are validated by ANSYS/Simplorer and PSCAD/EMTDC in device- and system-level, respectively.

<p>In this paper, a new transformerless buck-boost converter based on a ZETA converter is introduced. The proposed converter has the ZETA converter advantages, such as buck-boost capability, input-to-output dc insulation, and continuous output current. The suggested converter voltage gain is higher than the classic ZETA converter. In the presented converter, only one main switch is utilized. The proposed converter offers low voltage stress of the switch; therefore, the low on-state resistance of the main switch can be selected to decrease the losses of the switch. The presented converter topology is simple; hence, the control of the converter is simple. The converter has the continuous output current. The mathematical analyses of the presented converter are given. The experimental results confirm the correctness of the analysis.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Torque motor is one key component that directly influences the dynamic performance of jet pipe servo valve in aircraft. In this paper, a novel torque motor with hybrid-magnetization pole arrays is proposed. By changing the magnetization patterns of permanent magnets, the torque motor can significantly improve the output torque by range of 47-52% compared with traditional designs, while maintaining the system size and mass. The design concept and operating principle of the torque motor is presented. The magnetic field distribution is formulated analytically with equivalent magnetic circuit. Different from conventional study, the flux leakage of the permanent magnets and coils is included to improve the model precision. Subsequently, the output torque is derived mathematically from the airgap flux. Following that, the numerical calculation is conducted to validate the mathematical models of magnetic field and output torque. The design optimization is then carried out. One research prototype that can be mounted with either conventional magnet or the proposed hybrid array has been developed. The test rigs are constructed and experiments are conducted on the prototype. Both numerical computation and experimental results verify the significant improvement of torque generation of the proposed hybrid magnetization torque motor.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent development of object detection mainly depends on deep learning with large-scale benchmarks. However, collecting such fully-annotated data is often difficult or expensive for real-world applications, which restricts the power of deep neural networks in practice. Alternatively, humans can detect new objects with little annotation burden, since humans often use the prior knowledge to identify new objects with few elaborately-annotated examples, and subsequently generalize this capacity by exploiting objects from wild images. Inspired by this procedure of learning to detect, we propose a novel Progressive Object Transfer Detection (POTD) framework. Specifically, we make three main contributions in this paper. First, POTD can leverage various object supervision of different domains effectively into a progressive detection procedure. Via such human-like learning, one can boost a target detection task with few annotations. Second, POTD consists of two delicate transfer stages, i.e., Low-Shot Transfer Detection (LSTD), and Weakly-Supervised Transfer Detection (WSTD). In LSTD, we distill the implicit object knowledge of source detector to enhance target detector with few annotations. It can effectively warm up WSTD later on. In WSTD, we design a recurrent object labelling mechanism for learning to annotate weakly-labeled images. More importantly, we exploit the reliable object supervision from LSTD, which can further enhance the robustness of target detector in the WSTD stage. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on a number of challenging detection benchmarks with different settings. The results demonstrate that, our POTD outperforms the recent state-of-the-art approaches. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/Cassie94/LSTD/tree/lstd.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a new robust field-weakening approach for reluctance synchronous motors regulated by direct torque and flux control. Compared to the existing direct torque and flux control based field-weakening methods that cannot achieve maximized DC-link voltage utilization and are parameter dependent, the proposed approach contributes to improve the field-weakening performance of reluctance synchronous motor in two aspects. First, it extends the constant power speed range through autonomous stator flux reference adjustment, which maximizes the dc-link voltage utilization. Smooth transition between the maximum torque per ampere trajectory and field-weakening trajectory is also realized. Second, it enhances the parameter robustness of drives in very high-speed region by employing a torque reference adjustment scheme. This effectively avoids the instability of drives caused by machine parameter variations. The proposed approach is verified experimentally on a laboratory setup.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to the limits on market requirements, material conditions, and production situations in manufacturing process, conventional optimization approaches are difficult to obtain optimal economical and technical indices with physical constraints. To optimize several conflicting objects such as production rate, economic benefits, and gas emission, a hybrid-model-based intelligent optimization method that consists of an improved genetic algorithm and derived deep learning is put forward in this paper. Integration of the hybrid model has made modeling and optimizing an indivisible whole, in which the fitness of the genetic algorithm comes from deep neural networks by weighted sum of the output variables that correspond to the input solutions. The recurrent neural network (RNN) with disposition-gated recurrent unit (dGRU) is applied to capture the dynamics of blast furnace by training the model over datasets recorded in the production scene. Meanwhile, the self-adaptive population genetic algorithm (SAPGA) with a varied population size depending on the fitness distribution is used to locate the optimal solutions under current working conditions. The hybrid intelligent optimization model, validated by both numerical tests and practical data, has been running in an ironmaking plant for one year. It has proved to be successful in meeting industry demands by optimizing multiproduction indices simultaneously.

<p>The goal of psychometric scaling is the quantification of perceptual experiences, understanding the relationship between an external stimulus, the internal representation and the response. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework to fuse the outcome of different psychophysical experimental protocols, namely rating and pairwise comparisons experiments. Such a method can be used for merging existing datasets of subjective nature and for experiments in which both measurements are collected. We analyze and compare the outcomes of both types of experimental protocols in terms of time and accuracy in a set of simulations and experiments with benchmark and real-world image quality assessment datasets, showing the necessity of scaling and the advantages of each protocol and mixing. Although most of our examples focus on image quality assessment, our findings generalize to any other subjective quality-of-experience task.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Massive MIMO attains high spectral and power efficiency transmission by leveraging a large number of transmit antennas. However, to capture the benefits of massive MIMO, each antenna should be accompanied with a dedicated RF chain, and consequently, the hardware costs would scale up tremendously with the increase of the antennas. Cheap implementations of massive MIMO have recently gained considerable attention, and constant modulus (CM) signaling is seen as a promising solution, owing to its low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). This paper investigates the physical-layer (PHY) security in massive MIMO with an emphasis on the CM signaling. In particular, we consider a transmitter with massive antennas broadcast common confidential information to a group of legitimate receivers, and a number of eavesdroppers overhear the transmission and attempt to intercept the information. Our goal is to design the CM beamforming at the transmitter so that the multicast secrecy rate is maximized. This secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is generally NP-hard. To tackle it, two tractable approaches are developed. The first one employs the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique and the Charnes-Copper transformation to obtain a convex relaxation of the SRM problem. However, due to the dimension lifting of SDR, this approach is feasible only for small to medium antenna sizes. The second approach leverages the Dinkelbach method to work directly over the beamformer domain; a custom-build nonconvex alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed to efficiently perform each Dinkelbach update. Simulation results demonstrate that the second approach is computationally more efficient and can achieve nearly optimal performance when the number of antennas is large.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the optimal tradeoff between secrecy and non-secrecy rates of the MISO wiretap channels for different power constraint settings: sum power constraint only, per-antenna power constraints only, and joint sum and per-antenna power constraints. The problem is motivated by the fact that channel capacity and secrecy capacity are generally achieved by different transmit strategies. First, a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure a positive secrecy capacity is shown. The optimal tradeoff between secrecy rate and transmission rate is characterized by a weighted rate sum maximization problem. Since this problem is not necessarily convex, equivalent problem formulations are introduced to derive the optimal transmit strategies. Under sum power constraint only, a closed-form solution is provided. Under per-antenna power constraints, necessary conditions to find the optimal power allocation are derived. Sufficient conditions are provided for the special case of two transmit antennas. For the special case of aligned channels, the optimal transmit strategies can deduced from an equivalent point-to-point channel problem. Last, the theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Anomaly detection is an important technique used to identify patterns of unusual network behavior and keep the network under control. Today, network attacks are increasing in terms of both their number and sophistication. To avoid causing significant traffic patterns and being detected by existing techniques, many new attacks tend to involve gradual adjustment of behaviors, which always generate incomplete sessions due to their running mechanisms. Accordingly, in this work, we employ the behavior symmetry degree to profile the anomalies and further identify unusual behaviors. We first proposed a symmetry degree to identify the incomplete sessions generated by unusual behaviors; we then employ a sketch to calculate the symmetry degree of internal hosts to improve the identification efficiency for online applications. To reduce the memory cost and probability of collision, we divide the IP addresses into four segments that can be used as keys of the hash functions in the sketch. Moreover, to further improve detection accuracy, a threshold selection method is proposed for dynamic traffic pattern analysis. The hash functions in the sketch are then designed using Chinese remainder theory, which can analytically trace the IP addresses associated with the anomalies. We tested the proposed techniques based on traffic data collected from the northwest center of CERNET (China Education and Research Network); the results show that the proposed methods can effectively detect anomalies in large-scale networks.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Image restoration (IR) is a long-standing challenging problem in low-level image processing. It is of utmost importance to learn good image priors for pursuing visually pleasing results. In this paper, we develop a multi-channel and multi-model-based denoising autoencoder network as image prior for solving IR problem. Specifically, the network that trained on RGB-channel images is used to construct a prior at first, and then the learned prior is incorporated into single-channel grayscale IR tasks. To achieve the goal, we employ the auxiliary variable technique to integrate the higher-dimensional network-driven prior information into the iterative restoration procedure. In addition, according to the weighted aggregation idea, a multi-model strategy is put forward to enhance the network stability that favors to avoid getting trapped in local optima. Extensive experiments on image deblurring and deblocking tasks show that the proposed algorithm is efficient, robust, and yields state-of-the-art restoration quality on grayscale images.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Point cloud-based immersive media representation format has provided many opportunities for extended reality applications and has become widely used in volumetric content capturing scenarios. The high data rate of the point cloud is one of the key problems preventing the adoption of this media format. MPEG Immersive media working group (MPEG-I) aims to create a point cloud compression methodology relying on the existing video coding hardware implementations to solve this problem. However, in the scope of the state-of-the-art video-based dynamic point cloud compression (V-PCC) standard under MPEG-I, the intrinsic 3D object's motion continuity is destroyed by the 2D projections, resulting in a significant loss of inter prediction coding efficiency. In this paper, we first propose a general model utilizing the 3D motion and 3D to 2D correspondence to calculate the 2D motion vector (MV). Then, under the V-PCC, we propose a geometry-based method using the accurate 3D reconstructed geometry from the 2D geometry video to estimate the 2D MV in the 2D attribute video. In addition, we propose an auxiliary-information-based method using the coarse 3D reconstructed geometry provided by the auxiliary information to estimate the 2D MV in both the 2D geometry and attribute videos. Furthermore, we provide the following two ways to use the estimated 2D MV to improve coding efficiency. The first one is normative. We propose adding the estimated MV into the advanced MV candidate list and find a better MV predictor for each prediction unit (PU). The second one is non-normative. We propose applying the estimated MV as an additional candidate of the centers for motion estimation. We implement the proposed algorithms in the V-PCC reference software. Experimental results show that the proposed methods present significant coding gains compared with the current state-of-the-art motion prediction algorithm.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel deep sparse coding network (SCN) capable of efficiently adapting its own regularization parameters for a given application. The network is trained end-to-end with a supervised task-driven learning algorithm via error backpropagation. During training, the network learns both the dictionaries and the regularization parameters of each sparse coding layer so that the reconstructive dictionaries are smoothly transformed into increasingly discriminative representations. In addition, the adaptive regularization also offers the network more flexibility to adjust sparsity levels. Furthermore, we have devised a sparse coding layer utilizing a &#x201c;skinny&#x201d; dictionary. Integral to computational efficiency, these skinny dictionaries compress the high-dimensional sparse codes into lower dimensional structures. The adaptivity and discriminability of our 15-layer SCN are demonstrated on six benchmark datasets, namely Cifar-10, Cifar-100, STL-10, SVHN, MNIST, and ImageNet, most of which are considered difficult for sparse coding models. Experimental results show that our architecture overwhelmingly outperforms traditional one-layer sparse coding architectures while using much fewer parameters. Moreover, our multilayer architecture exploits the benefits of depth with sparse coding's characteristic ability to operate on smaller datasets. In such data-constrained scenarios, our technique demonstrates a highly competitive performance compared with the deep neural networks.
