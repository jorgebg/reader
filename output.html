<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose MgX, a near-zero overhead memory protection scheme
for hardware accelerators. MgX minimizes the performance overhead of off-chip
memory encryption and integrity verification by exploiting the
application-specific aspect of accelerators. Accelerators tend to explicitly
manage data movement between on-chip and off-chip memory, typically at an
object granularity that is much larger than cache lines. Exploiting these
accelerator-specific characteristics, MgX generates version numbers used in
memory encryption and integrity verification only using on-chip state without
storing them in memory, and also customizes the granularity of the memory
protection to match the granularity used by the accelerator. To demonstrate the
applicability of MgX, we present an in-depth study of MgX for deep neural
network (DNN) and also describe implementations for H.264 video decoding and
genome alignment. Experimental results show that applying MgX has less than 1%
performance overhead for both DNN inference and training on state-of-the-art
DNN architectures.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Federated machine learning which enables resource constrained node devices
(e.g., mobile phones and IoT devices) to learn a shared model while keeping the
training data local, can provide privacy, security and economic benefits by
designing an effective communication protocol. However, the communication
protocol amongst different nodes could be exploited by attackers to launch data
poisoning attacks, which has been demonstrated as a big threat to most machine
learning models. In this paper, we attempt to explore the vulnerability of
federated machine learning. More specifically, we focus on attacking a
federated multi-task learning framework, which is a federated learning
framework via adopting a general multi-task learning framework to handle
statistical challenges. We formulate the problem of computing optimal poisoning
attacks on federated multi-task learning as a bilevel program that is adaptive
to arbitrary choice of target nodes and source attacking nodes. Then we propose
a novel systems-aware optimization method, ATTack on Federated Learning
(AT2FL), which is efficiency to derive the implicit gradients for poisoned
data, and further compute optimal attack strategies in the federated machine
learning. Our work is an earlier study that considers issues of data poisoning
attack for federated learning. To the end, experimental results on real-world
datasets show that federated multi-task learning model is very sensitive to
poisoning attacks, when the attackers either directly poison the target nodes
or indirectly poison the related nodes by exploiting the communication
protocol.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>System-level audit logs often play a critical role in computer forensics.
They capture low-level interactions between programs and users in much detail,
making them a rich source of insight and provenance on malicious user activity.
However, using these logs to discover and understand malicious activities when
a typical computer generates more than 2.5 million system events hourly is both
compute and time-intensive. We introduce a graphical system called GrAALF for
efficiently loading, storing, processing, querying, and displaying system
events to support computer forensics. In comparison to other related systems
such as AIQL [13] and SAQL [12], GrAALF offers the flexibility of multiple
backend storage solutions, easy-to-use and intuitive querying of logs, and the
ability to trace back longer sequences of system events in (near) real-time to
help identify and isolate attacks. Equally important, both AIQL and SAQL are
not available for public use, whereas GrAALF is open-source. GrAALF offers the
choice of compactly storing the logs in main memory, in a relational database
system, in a hybrid main memory-database system, and a graph-based database. We
compare the responsiveness of each of these options, using multiple huge
system-call log files. Next, in multiple real-world attack scenarios, we
demonstrate the efficacy and usefulness of GrAALF in identifying the attack and
discovering its provenance. Consequently, GrAALF offers a robust solution for
analysis of audit logs to support computer forensics.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Three closely-related polynomial-based group key pre-distribution schemes
have recently been proposed, aimed specifically at wireless sensor networks.
The schemes enable any subset of a predefined set of sensor nodes to establish
a shared secret key without any communications overhead. It is claimed that
these schemes are both secure and lightweight, i.e.\ making them particularly
appropriate for network scenarios where nodes have limited computational and
storage capabilities. Further papers have built on these schemes, e.g.\ to
propose secure routing protocols for wireless sensor networks. Unfortunately,
as we show in this paper, all three schemes are completely insecure; whilst the
details of their operation varies, they share common weaknesses. In every case
we show that an attacker equipped with the information built into at most two
sensor nodes can compute group keys for all possible groups of which the
attacked nodes are not a member, which breaks a fundamental design objective.
The attacks can also be achieved by an attacker armed with the information from
a single node together with a single group key to which this sensor node is not
entitled. Repairing the schemes appears difficult, if not impossible. The
existence of major flaws is not surprising given the complete absence of any
rigorous proofs of security for the proposed schemes.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Goal: As the Coronavirus Pandemic of 2019/2020 unfolds, a COVID-19 'Immunity
Passport' has been mooted as a way to enable individuals to return back to work
or be admitted to current off-limits locations. While the quality of antibody
testing and the likelihood of even attaining COVID-19 immunity continue to be
researched, we address the issues involved in providing tamper-proof and
privacy-preserving certification, both for COVID-19 immunity and in general.
Methods: We developed a prototype mobile phone app and requisite distributed
server architecture that facilitates instant verification of tamper-proof test
results. Personally identifiable information is only stored at the user's
discretion, and the app allows the end-user selectively to present only the
specific test result with no other personal information revealed. Behind the
scenes it relies upon (a) the 2019 World Wide Web Consortium standard called
'Verifiable Credentials', (b) Tim Berners-Lee's decentralized personal data
platform 'Solid', and (c) a consortium Ethereum-based blockchain. Results: Our
mobile phone app and distributed server architecture enable the mixture of
verifiability and privacy in a manner derived from public/private key pairs and
digital signatures, generalized to avoid restrictive ownership of sensitive
digital keys and/or data. For the test certificate Holder, Issuer (e.g. doctor,
pharmacy) and Verifier (e.g. employer), it is 'just another app' which takes
only minutes to use. Conclusions: The app and distributed server architecture
offer a prototype proof of concept that is readily scalable, applicable
generically, and in effect 'waiting in the wings' for the biological issues,
plus key ethical issues raised in the discussion section, to be resolved.

However, pyrethroid resistance is now widespread and threatens to not only render LLINs irrelevant, but also to reverse the gains made towards malaria elimination. The concern about resistance has prompted a suggestion that insecticides should be removed from LLINs to preserve them for other use in vector control measures.1

<p>In response to the global challenge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), many countries have launched priority initiatives. The UK established a national action plan against AMR in 2000, followed by the USA and Germany in 2015.1&#8211;3 A crucial development in these initiatives, as well as AMR strategies in most Nordic and some southern EU countries such as Spain,4 is a focus on a One Health perspective that includes priorities such as developing prevention strategies, breaking transmission chains, enhancing surveillance, improving treatment and diagnostics, and raising awareness nationally and internationally.

<p>It was the news from Wuhan, China, in the first days of 2020 that made Sarah Gilbert sit up and think. As Professor of Vaccinology at the University of Oxford in the UK, and a leading scientist at the university's Jenner Institute, her research team wasted no time in getting involved. &#8220;We had recently started thinking about an appropriate response to Disease X; how could we mobilise and focus our resources to go more quickly than we had ever gone before. And then Disease X arrived&#8221;, she says. Once the genome sequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became available in mid-January, Gilbert's team set to work to design a vaccine, using recombinant DNA techniques to create a SARS-CoV-2 antigen and embedding it within a primate adenovirus vector.

<p>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) refers to the integrative system consisting of interconnected computing and control devices interacting with the physical infrastructure via sensors and actuators. Recently, there is a swift growth of CPSs ranging from smart grids to smart buildings, robotics, and other industrial control systems. They have formed the keystone of the sustainable growth of the economy, manufacturing, and smart and connected communities. Due to extensive applications of CPSs, their resilience, reliability, and security are paramount. Many factors, however, pose significant threats to CPSs and lead to high economic losses and social impacts. Software defects also make CPSs vulnerable to security attacks and coordinated cyber and physical attacks. To address this issue, emerging technologies and methods for understanding and improving the resilience, reliability, and security of CPSs are needed. This Special Section aims to provide a platform to help define, understand, and quantify the resilience, reliability, and security of CPSs.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We present the physical-layer maximum a posteriori (MAP) test for detecting false data in multiple-source wireless relay networks. The MAP test, which minimizes the average probability of detection error, exploits the noisy (erroneous) information about the true packet that the destination receives (overhears) directly from the source nodes as a reference. We show that the average probability of detection error decreases exponentially as the number of source nodes increases, regardless of the reliability of the reference information. This indicates that the multiplicity of source nodes can be leveraged to construct a powerful integrity check mechanism for detecting false data at the destination. We also present a parallel MAP test that improves the detection accuracy when the number of source nodes is limited and overhearing channel disparities are high. Then, we present a packet recovery mechanism to recover false alarmed packets, i.e. unmodified packets that are mistakenly declared as modified, by the MAP test and thereby to improve the throughput.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To effectively capture interactions of large-scale ac&#x2013;dc systems integrating line commutated converter (LCC) and modular multilevel converter (MMC) based multiterminal dc grids, a numerically accurate and efficient simulation method is desirable. To achieve this objective, a cosimulation method is proposed in this article, where the target system is decoupled into the shifted-frequency phasor (SFP) subsystem, the dynamic phasor (DP) subsystem, and electromagnetic transient (EMT) subsystem, respectively. The MMCs are included in the SFP subsystem and implemented on massively paralleled graphics processing units (GPUs). Thus, the simulation efficiency is greatly improved by adopting a much larger time step, the model order reduction technique, and GPU acceleration. The LCCs are represented by DPs and are included in the DP subsystem. The majority of ac grids are covered in the EMT subsystem. Further, the interactions between SFP and EMT subsystems are reflected by the proposed multidomain transmission line model, which can produce instantaneous and phasor values simultaneously. The interface model between DP and EMT subsystems is modeled as a special controlled voltage and current circuit. Finally, the overall cosimulation method is realized by the respective SFP/DP and EMT models, among which their interactions are reflected by the proposed interface models and the time sequences of simulations. The performance of the proposed method has been fully validated on a practical large-scale ac&#x2013;dc system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This article introduces a rotary semiactive variable stiffness (VS) device, including its system design and model validation. A variable damping (VD) device and springs can form mechanical networks with specific topologies, and the VD device can control the equivalent stiffness of the network by varying its damping. The proposed rotary electromagnetic VS device consists of an electromagnetic VD device and a torsion spring, which are in series, while a planetary gear reducer is used to amplify the torque output of the VS device. The models of the electromagnetic VD and VS devices are both built and validated with tests. Then, a seat suspension applies the VS device by installing the device in the center of its scissors structure. Bump and random vibration experiments are implemented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed VS system for seat suspension vibration control. The new system has merits in controllability and energy efficiency. It is easier to design the controller than the conventional one with magnetorheological damper due to the linear damping of the electromagnetic VD device. Besides, the system energy consumption is low and has energy harvesting capability. The proposed semiactive electromagnetic VS device also has potential in other practical applicationss.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, we propose a time-sequential switching light-field (LF) camera for an alternative image capture of the high-resolution two-dimensional (2-D) images and three-dimensional (3-D) LF elemental images as additional functionalities. For image data acquisitions of both the 2-D and 3-D LF imaging of moving objects at a video frame rate (or even higher frame rate up to approximately 1000 f&#x002f;s), a polarization-dependent-switching microlens array (MLA) is implemented in the LF camera system instead of a conventional passive-type MLA. By controlling the incident polarization conditions using an electrically fast-switching liquid crystal layer, the imaging mode can be time-sequentially switched quite rapidly (switching times of approximately 220 and 290 &#x03bc;s for the mode conversions from the 3-D LF to the 2-D mode, and the reversal mode change, respectively). Using the elemental image sets sampled from the alternating time-sequential imaging results, either the directional-view images or depth-refocused images can be reconstructed and provided at a moving picture frame rate. The depth-refocused images are possible for a wide depth range from 25 to 350&#x00a0;cm. Directional views of 22 &#x00d7; 22 and 9 &#x00d7; 9 in portions can be reconstructed for the single-shot image capture and the time-sequential video-rate image capture, respectively.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The quality assessment of the sound power generated by refrigeration compressors is an important and costly process for manufacturers, mainly due to the need for acoustic rooms. Hence, very few samples per lot are tested. In this article, an alternative method based on soft sensing is proposed to estimate the sound power of refrigeration compressors. The method uses vibration measurements from the compressor surface as the input and the sound power generated as the output of machine learning (ML) models to create data-driven soft sensors. This method is less restrictive than the traditional ones and allows a test to be done close to the manufacturing line, in a much faster and cheaper way. In order to create the dataset to train the ML models, sound power and vibration levels of compressors were measured simultaneously in a reverberation room. The results from the data-driven soft sensors were compared with the ones obtained using a simple analytic model defined in an ISO technical note and showed that, even with as little as one vibration measurement point, the proposed method presented better results than the ISO analytic model with nine measurement points.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The problem of inefficient and unevenly distributed spectrum usage in industrial wireless networks has led to the emergence of the concept of industrial cognitive radio (CR) networks, which have particularly important applications in automotive industry. Industrial CR networks are planned to function in a wide spectrum range; therefore, they have high energy consumption because of frequency switching while other wireless technologies do not have this problem. A distinctive feature of this switching cost is that it depends on the wideness between the two frequency bands. In this article, we formulate the joint frequency assignment and scheduling problem for multihop industrial CR networks with a single transceiver by considering varying amounts of energy consumption that occurs while CR devices switch to different frequency bands. Our optimization problem, which we formulate as an integer linear program, minimizes the energy cost related to frequency switching while making frequency and time slot allocation to the cognitive devices. We prove that even on star graphs, our formulated problem is inapproximable within any polynomial-time computable function $f(n)$ in addition to being $textsc {NP}text {-Hard}$ in the strong sense. Therefore, we propose a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm to solve the energy consumption problem due to channel switching. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of our heuristic algorithm is very close to the results obtained from the integer linear programming implementation by CPLEX optimization software. We also compare our proposed method with the corresponding constant energy consumption for frequency switching case and two state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrate that taking into account the different energy consumption while switching to different frequency bands -
s vital for joint frequency assignment and scheduling in multihop industrial CR networks with a single transceiver.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Poor signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and low spatial resolutions have impeded low-cost pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensors from many intelligent applications for thermal target detection/recognition. This article presents a cognitive signal conditioning and modulation learning framework for PIR sensing with the following two innovations to solve these problems: 1) a reconfigurable signal conditioning circuit design to achieve high SNRs and 2) an optimal sensor mask design to achieve high recognition performance. By using a programmable system on chip, the PIR signal amplifier gain and filter bandwidth can be adjusted automatically according to working conditions. Based on the modeling between PIR physics and thermal images, sensor masks can be optimized through training convolution neural networks with large thermal image datasets for feature extraction of specific thermal targets. The experimental results verify the improved performance of PIR sensors in various working conditions and applications by using the developed reconfigurable circuit and application-specific masks.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, we present a metaheuristic-based control framework, called beetle antennae olfactory recurrent neural network, for simultaneous tracking control and obstacle avoidance of a redundant manipulator. The ability to avoid obstacles while tracking a predefined reference path is critical for any industrial manipulator. The formulated control framework unifies the tracking control and obstacle avoidance into a single constrained optimization problem by introducing a penalty term into the objective function, which actively rewards the optimizer for avoiding the obstacles. One of the significant features of the proposed framework is the way that the penalty term is formulated following a straightforward principle: maximize the minimum distance between a manipulator and an obstacle. The distance calculations are based on Gilbert&#x2013;Johnson&#x2013;Keerthi algorithm, which calculates the distance between a manipulator and an obstacle by directly using their three-dimensional geometries, which also implies that our algorithm works for a manipulator and an arbitrarily shaped obstacle. Theoretical treatment proves the stability and convergence, and simulations results using an LBR IIWA seven-DOF manipulator are presented to analyze the performance of the proposed framework.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, we consider the security problem for the consensus-based distributed state estimation. To resist the malicious attacker who can falsify the data transmitted through the wireless channel, each node equips with an attack defender, which is based on the measurement of its built-in sensor. Under the stealthy attack, which can deceive the defender, we investigate the resilience and convergence of the distributed estimation in two different attack scenarios. For the attack with enough communication resources, we provide a sufficient condition of the optimal attack to quantify the maximum estimation performance degradation. We also analyze the resilience of the worst case distributed estimation caused by the attacker. For the attack with limited resources, the optimal Kalman gain for each node is derived to maximize its estimation performance under the attack. We also give a sufficient condition to guarantee the convergence of the distributed estimation in this case. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effect of the defender on guaranteeing the resilience of sensor networks against attacks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep learning methods for image quality assessment (IQA) are limited due to the small size of existing datasets. Extensive datasets require substantial resources both for generating publishable content and annotating it accurately. We present a systematic and scalable approach to creating KonIQ-10k, the largest IQA dataset to date, consisting of 10,073 quality scored images. It is the first in-the-wild database aiming for ecological validity, concerning the authenticity of distortions, the diversity of content, and quality-related indicators. Through the use of crowdsourcing, we obtained 1.2 million reliable quality ratings from 1,459 crowd workers, paving the way for more general IQA models. We propose a novel, deep learning model (KonCept512), to show an excellent generalization beyond the test set (0.921 SROCC), to the current state-of-the-art database LIVE-in-the-Wild (0.825 SROCC). The model derives its core performance from the InceptionResNet architecture, being trained at a higher resolution than previous models (512 &#x00d7; 384 ). Correlation analysis shows that KonCept512 performs similar to having 9 subjective scores for each test image.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In automatic signature verification, questioned specimens are usually compared with reference signatures. In writer-dependent schemes, a number of reference signatures are required to build up the individual signer model while a writer-independent system requires a set of reference signatures from several signers to develop the model of the system. This paper addresses the problem of automatic signature verification when no reference signatures are available. The scenario we explore consists of a set of signatures, which could be signed by the same author or by multiple signers. As such, we discuss three methods which estimate automatically the common authorship of a set of off-line signatures. The first method develops a score similarity matrix, worked out with the assistance of duplicated signatures; the second uses a feature-distance matrix for each pair of signatures; and the last method introduces pre-classification based on the complexity of each signature. Publicly available signatures were used in the experiments, which gave encouraging results. As a baseline for the performance obtained by our approaches, we carried out a visual Turing Test where forensic and non-forensic human volunteers, carrying out the same task, performed less well than the automatic schemes.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The side-channel leakage is a consequence of program execution in a computer processor, and understanding relationship between code execution and information leakage is a necessary step in estimating information leakage and its capacity limits. This paper proposes a methodology to relate program execution to electromagnetic side-channel emanations and estimates side-channel information capacity created by execution of series of instructions (e.g., a function, a procedure, or a program) in a processor. To model dependence among program instructions in a code, we propose to use Markov source model, which includes the dependencies among sequence of instructions as well as dependencies among instructions as they pass through a pipeline of the processor. The emitted electromagnetic (EM) signals during instruction executions are natural choice for the inputs into the model. To obtain the channel inputs for the proposed model, we derive a mathematical relationship between the emanated instruction signal power (ESP) and total emanated signal power while running a program. Then, we derive the leakage capacity of EM side channels created by execution of series of instructions in a processor. Finally, we provide experimental results to demonstrate that leakages could be severe and that a dedicated attacker could obtain important information.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Online romance scams are a prevalent form of mass-marketing fraud in the West, and yet few studies have presented data-driven responses to this problem. In this type of scam, fraudsters craft fake profiles and manually interact with their victims. Because of the characteristics of this type of fraud and how dating sites operate, traditional detection methods (e.g., those used in spam filtering) are ineffective. In this paper, we investigate the archetype of online dating profiles used in this form of fraud, including their use of demographics, profile descriptions, and images, shedding light on both the strategies deployed by scammers to appeal to victims and the traits of victims themselves. Furthermore, in response to the severe financial and psychological harm caused by dating fraud, we develop a system to detect romance scammers on online dating platforms. This paper presents the first fully described system for automatically detecting this fraud. Our aim is to provide an early detection system to stop romance scammers as they create fraudulent profiles or before they engage with potential victims. Previous research has indicated that the victims of romance scams score highly on scales for idealized romantic beliefs. We combine a range of structured, unstructured, and deep-learned features that capture these beliefs in order to build a detection system. Our ensemble machine-learning approach is robust to the omission of profile details and performs at high accuracy (97%) in a hold-out validation set. The system enables development of automated tools for dating site providers and individual users.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Benefiting from the quick development of deep convolutional neural networks, especially fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), remarkable progresses have been achieved on salient object detection recently. Nevertheless, these FCNs based methods are still challenging to generate high resolution saliency maps, and also not applicable for subsequent applications due to their heavy model weights. In this paper, we propose a compact and efficient deep network with high accuracy for salient object detection. Firstly, we propose two strategies for initial prediction, one is a new designed multi-scale context module, the other is incorporating hand-crafted saliency priors. Secondly, we employ residual learning to refine it progressively by only learning the residual in each side-output, which can be achieved with few convolutional parameters, therefore leads to high compactness and high efficiency. Finally, we further design a novel top-down reverse attention block to guide the above side-output residual learning. Specifically, the current predicted salient regions are used to erase its side-output feature, thus the missing object parts and details can be efficiently learned from these unerased regions, which results in more complete detection and high accuracy. Extensive experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed network performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches, and shows advantages in simplicity, compactness and efficiency.

Under the compressed sensing framework, various sparse transformations and low-rank constraints based methods have great performances in recovering irregularly missing traces. However, in the case of regularly missing traces, their applications are limited because of the strong spatial aliasing energies. In addition, the erratic noise always poses a serious impact on the interpolation results obtained by the sparse transformations and low-rank constraints-based methods,. This is because the erratic noise is far from satisfying the statistical assumption behind these methods. In this study, we propose a mathematical morphology-based interpolation technique, which constrains the morphological scale of the model in the inversion process. The inversion problem is solved by the shaping regularization approach. The mathematical morphological constraint (MMC)-based interpolation technique has a satisfactory robustness to the spatial aliasing and erratic energies. We provide a detailed algorithmic framework and discuss the extension from 2D to higher dimensional version and the back operator in the shaping inversion. A group of numerical examples demonstrates the successful performance of the proposed technique.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The human visual system tends to consider saliency of an object as a whole. Some object-level saliency detection methods have been proposed by leveraging object proposals in bounding boxes, and regarding the entire bounding box as one candidate salient region. However, the bounding boxes can not provide exact object position and a lot of pixels in bounding boxes belong to the background. Consequently, background pixels in bounding box also show high saliency. Besides, acquiring object proposals needs high time cost. In order to compute object-level saliency, we consider region growing from some seed superpixels, to find one surrounding region which probably represents the whole object. The desired surrounding region has similar appearance inside and obvious difference with the outside, which is proposed as maximally stable region (MSR) in this paper. In addition, one effective seed superpixel selection strategy is presented to improve speed. MSR based saliency detection is more robust than pixel or superpixel level methods and object proposal based methods. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods at 50 FPS. Compared with deep learning based methods, we show worse performance, but with about 1200-1600 times faster, which means better trade-off between performance and speed.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Super-resolution phase retrieval is an inverse problem that appears in diffractive optical imaging (DOI) and consists in estimating a high-resolution image from low-resolution phaseless measurements. DOI has three diffraction zones where the data can be acquired, known as near, middle, and far fields. Recent works have studied super-resolution phase retrieval under a setup that records coded diffraction patterns at the near and far fields. However, the attainable resolution of the image is mainly governed by the sensor characteristics, whose cost increases in proportion to the resolution. Also, these methodologies lack theoretical analysis. Hence, this work derives super-resolution models from low-resolution coded phaseless measurements at any diffraction zone that in contrast to prior contributions, the attainable resolution of the image is determined by the resolution of the coded aperture. For the proposed models, the existence of a unique solution (up to a global unimodular constant) is guaranteed with high probability, which can be increased by designing the coded aperture. Therefore, a strategy that designs the spatial distribution of the coded aperture is developed. Additionally, a super-resolution phase retrieval algorithm that minimizes a smoothed nonconvex least-squares objective function is proposed. The method first approximates the image by a spectral algorithm, which is then refined based upon a sequence of alternate steps. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm overcomes state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing the high-resolution image. In addition, the reconstruction quality using designed coded apertures is higher than that of the non-designed ensembles.
