</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p><span class="paragraphSection"><strong>To the Editor</strong> Dr Psaty and colleagues compared precision medicine and preventive medicine as 2 distinct models in medicine. They posited that precision medicine is deterministic, often with a gene-centric approach, while preventive medicine is probabilistic and applies to common conditions such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The 2 models are complementary and not competitive. Emerging scientific evidence will guide physicians toward preventive and curative interventions that can work best at the population or individual levels. As envisioned by the All of Us research program, precision medicine encompasses both treatment and prevention and is more than genetics: &#8220;Precision medicine takes into account individual differences in lifestyle, environment, and biology.&#8221; Furthermore, precision does not necessarily imply biologic determinism. Most human diseases are due to complex gene-environment interactions that can lead only to probabilistic approaches to prevention.</span>

<p><span class="paragraphSection">We have frequently emphasized the fact that medicine and those who practice it can never be the same after the war as before. We fully recognize that we are in the presence of a great social upheaval whose effect throughout the world will probably surpass even that momentous event known as the French Revolution. We can see only dimly whither we are tending, but it is at least evident that civilization is moving rapidly, whether down a steep place into the sea or, as some believe, up into the heights of the Promised Land. In this movement the medical profession is to a degree caught in the sweep of forces beyond its control, but it is also to a large extent potent and responsible for the part it shall play in the new era dawning on us. Many individual physicians have been more or less completely, if temporarily, uprooted by mobilization for war, and the whole medical profession, like many other professions, has been jostled out of its stability and routine. It is a time to many for strenuous readjustment; it is also an unequaled opportunity for surveying the future of medicine and formulating plans for a rational development. One thing is certain: that no limited considerations of self interest are going to satisfy either the bulk of medical practitioners or the public they serve. The practice of medicine will more than ever be regarded not merely as a means of earning a livelihood but as an essential service to mankind.</span>

<p>Deaths from synthetic opioids, natural and semi-synthetic opioids, and heroin totalled 49&#8200;068 in 2017 in the USA, with the sharpest increase occurring in fatal overdose related to oxycodone, fentanyl, and fentanyl analogues. In Europe, five fentanyl derivatives were identified in 2017, and these are being mixed with other drugs, including heroin and cocaine. The danger of mixing different drugs is that the user is often unaware of which substances they are consuming with the result that they are at even greater risk of overdose&#8212;particularly problematic with fentanyl, which is estimated to be between 50 and 100 times more potent than heroin.

<p>We thank George Garas and colleagues for their interest in our paper on IDEAL and progress in clinical research in surgery.

We discuss this deficit in our recent revision of the IDEAL Recommendations.1 We have proposed a stage 0 within IDEAL-D, for use with therapeutic devices,2 but have not yet done so for operations.

<p>The thermal camera can capture keyboard surface temperature change after a human&#x2019;s touch. This phenomenon may be used to steal users&#x2019; passwords physically. In this paper, based on the study of thermal dynamics of keyboards, we design a password break system using an infrared thermal camera. First, we build a signal model to describe the dynamic process of temperature change on the keyboard using Newton&#x2019;s law of cooling. Next, we develop a maximum likelihood parameter estimation algorithm to estimate the keystroke time instants. Then, by maximizing the probability of key order arrangement, a novel password breaking algorithm is developed. Our algorithm is tested using simulated data as well as real-world data. Experiment results show that our algorithm is effective for physical password breaking using thermal characteristics. Based on our results, we discuss strategies for password protection at the end.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The forensic investigation of JPEG compression generally relies on the analysis of first-order statistics based on image histogram. The JPEG compression detection methods based on such methodology can be effortlessly circumvented by adopting some anti-forensic attacks. This paper presents a counter JPEG anti-forensic method by considering the second-order statistical analysis based on the co-occurrence matrices (CMs). The proposed framework comprises three stages: selection of the target difference image, evaluation of CMs, and generation of second-order statistical feature based on CMs. In the first stage, we explore the effects of dithering operation of JPEG anti-forensics by analyzing the variance inconsistencies along the diagonals. Afterward, CMs are evaluated in the second stage to highlight the effects of grainy noise introduced during the dithering operation. The third stage is devoted to generate an optimal second-order statistical feature which is fed to the SVM classifier. The experimental results based on the uncompressed color image database and BOSSBase dataset images demonstrated that the proposed forensic detector based on CM is very efficient even in the presence of anti-forensic attacks. Moreover, the experimental results also confirm the competency of the proposed method in counter median filtering and contrast enhancement anti-forensics. The proposed scheme also provides satisfactory results in detecting other image processing operations such as mean filtering, Gaussian filtering, Weiner filtering, scaling, and rotation, thereby revealing its multi-purpose nature.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We study deterministic approximations of the Gaussian two-user multiple access wiretap channel (G-MAC-WT) and the Gaussian wiretap channel with a helper (G-WT-H). These approximations enable results beyond the recently shown 2/3 and 1/2 secure degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) for the G-MAC-WT and the G-WT-H, respectively. While the s.d.o.f. were obtained by real interference alignment, our approach uses signal-scale alignment. We show achievable schemes which are independent of the rationality of the channel gains. Moreover, our results can differentiate between channel strengths, in particular, between both users, and will establish secrecy rates dependent on this difference. We can show that the resulting achievable secrecy rates tend to the s.d.o.f. for vanishing channel gain differences. Moreover, we extend previous and develop new techniques to prove generalized s.d.o.f. bounds for varying channel strengths and show that our achievable schemes reach the bounds for certain channel gain parameters. We believe that our analysis is the next step toward a constant-gap analysis of the G-MAC-WT and the G-WT-H.

<p>Multiple user active authentications, in contrast with the single user active authentication, require the verification of identity of multiple subjects. Both traditional verification and identification-based solutions fail to address the specific challenges presented in this problem. We introduce Extremal Openset Rejection, a two-fold mechanism with a sparse representation-based identification step and a verification step for this purpose. In the verification step, concentration of the sparsity vector and the overlap between matched and non-matched distributions are considered for decision making. We introduce a semi-parametric model based on Extreme Value Theory for modeling the distributions, and an algorithm to estimate the parameters of extreme value distributions. Effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using three publicly available face-based mobile active authentication data sets.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We consider a single-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system in which a base station (BS) with a large number of antennas transmits simultaneously to several single-antenna users. The BS acquires the channel state information (CSI) for various receivers using uplink pilot transmissions. We demonstrate the vulnerability of the CSI estimation process to pilot-contamination (PC) attacks. In our attack model, the attacker aims at minimizing the sum rate of downlink transmissions by contaminating the uplink pilots. We first study these attacks for two downlink power allocation strategies under the assumption that the attacker knows the locations of the BS and its users. Later on, we relax this assumption and consider the case when such knowledge is probabilistic. The formulated problems are solved using stochastic optimization, Lagrangian minimization, and game-theoretic methods. A closed-form solution for a special case of the problem is obtained. Furthermore, we analyze the achievable individual secrecy rates under PC attacks and provide an upper bound on these rates. We also study this scenario without a priori knowledge of user locations at the attacker by introducing chance constraints. Our results indicate that such attacks can degrade the throughput of a massive MIMO system by more than 50&#x0025;.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized the computer vision research and have seen unprecedented adoption for multiple tasks, such as classification, detection, and caption generation. However, they offer little transparency into their inner workings and are often treated as black boxes that deliver excellent performance. In this paper, we aim at alleviating this opaqueness of CNNs by providing visual explanations for the network&#x2019;s predictions. Our approach can analyze a variety of CNN-based models trained for computer vision applications, such as object recognition and caption generation. Unlike the existing methods, we achieve this via unraveling the forward pass operation. The proposed method exploits feature dependencies across the layer hierarchy and uncovers the discriminative image locations that guide the network&#x2019;s predictions. We name these locations CNN fixations, loosely analogous to human eye fixations. Our approach is a generic method that requires no architectural changes, additional training, or gradient computation, and computes the important image locations (CNN fixations). We demonstrate through a variety of applications that our approach is able to localize the discriminative image locations across different network architectures, diverse vision tasks, and data modalities.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of using depth information in salient object detection. However, the most commonly seen images so far are still RGB images that do not contain the depth data. Meanwhile, the human brain can extract the geometric model of a scene from an RGB-only image and hence provides a 3D perception of the scene. Inspired by this observation, we propose a new concept named RGB-&#x2018;D&#x2019; saliency detection, which derives pseudo depth from the RGB images and then performs 3D saliency detection. The pseudo depth can be utilized as image features, prior knowledge, an additional image channel, or independent depth-induced models to boost the performance of traditional RGB saliency models. As an illustration, we develop a new salient object detection algorithm that uses the pseudo depth to derive a depth-driven background prior and a depth contrast feature. Extensive experiments on several standard databases validate the promising performance of the proposed algorithm. In addition, we also adapt two supervised RGB saliency models to our RGB-&#x2018;D&#x2019; saliency framework for performance enhancement. The results further demonstrate the generalization ability of the proposed RGB-&#x2018;D&#x2019; saliency framework.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fractional interpolation is used to provide sub-pixel level references for motion compensation in the interprediction of video coding, which attempts to remove temporal redundancy in video sequences. Traditional handcrafted fractional interpolation filters face the challenge of modeling discontinuous regions in videos, while existing deep learning-based methods are either designed for a single quantization parameter (QP), only generating half-pixel samples, or need to train a model for each sub-pixel position. In this paper, we present a one-for-all fractional interpolation method based on a grouped variation convolutional neural network (GVCNN). Our method can deal with video frames coded using different QPs and is capable of generating all sub-pixel positions at one sub-pixel level. Also, by predicting variations between integer-position pixels and sub-pixels, our network offers more expressive power. Moreover, we perform specific measurements in training data generation to simulate practical situations in video coding, including blurring the down-sampled sub-pixel samples to avoid aliasing effects and coding integer pixels to simulate reconstruction errors. In addition, we analyze the impact of the size of blur kernels theoretically. Experimental results verify the efficiency of GVCNN. Compared with HEVC, our method achieves 2.2&#x0025; in bit saving on average and up to 5.2&#x0025; under low-delay P configuration.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>As one of the most widely used clustering techniques, the fuzzy  $k$ -means (FKM) assigns every data point to each cluster with a certain degree of membership. However, conventional FKM approach relies on the square data fitting term, which is sensitive to the outliers with ignoring the prior information. In this paper, we develop a novel and robust fuzzy  $k$ -means clustering algorithm, namely, joint learning of fuzzy  $k$ -means and nonnegative spectral clustering with side information. The proposed method combines fuzzy  $k$ -means and nonnegative spectral clustering into a unified model, which can further exploit the prior knowledge of data pairs such that both the quality of affinity graph and the clustering performance can be improved. In addition, for the purpose of enhancing the robustness, the adaptive loss function is adopted in the objective function, since it smoothly interpolates between  $ell _{1}$ -norm and  $ell _{2}$ -norm. Finally, experimental results on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness and the superiority of our clustering method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Hashing has attracted increasing research attention in recent years due to its high efficiency of computation and storage in image retrieval. Recent works have demonstrated the superiority of simultaneous feature representations and hash functions learning with deep neural networks. However, most existing deep hashing methods directly learn the hash functions by encoding the global semantic information, while ignoring the local spatial information of images. The loss of local spatial structure makes the performance bottleneck of hash functions, therefore limiting its application for accurate similarity retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel deep ordinal hashing (DOH) method, which learns ordinal representations to generate ranking-based hash codes by leveraging the ranking structure of feature space from both local and global views. In particular, to effectively build the ranking structure, we propose to learn the rank correlation space by exploiting the local spatial information from fully convolutional network and the global semantic information from the convolutional neural network simultaneously. More specifically, an effective spatial attention model is designed to capture the local spatial information by selectively learning well-specified locations closely related to target objects. In such hashing framework, the local spatial and global semantic nature of images is captured in an end-to-end ranking-to-hashing manner. Experimental results conducted on three widely used datasets demonstrate that the proposed DOH method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing methods.

<p>Common fall occurrences in the elderly population pose dramatic challenges in public healthcare domain. Adoption of an efficient and yet highly reliable automatic fall detection system may not only mitigate the adverse effects of falls through immediate medical assistance, but also profoundly improve the functional ability and confidence level of elder people. This paper presents a pervasive fall detection system developed on smart phones, namely, FallDroid that exploits a two-step algorithm proposed to monitor and detect fall events using the embedded accelerometer signals. Comprising of the threshold-based method and multiple kernel learning support vector machine, the proposed algorithm uses novel techniques to effectively identify fall-like events (such as lying on a bed or sudden stop after running) and reduce false alarms. In addition to user convenience and low power consumption, experimental results reveal that the system detects falls with high accuracy ($97.8%$ and $91.7%$), sensitivity ($99.5%$ and $95.8%$), and specificity ($95.2%$ and $88.0%$) when placed around the waist and thigh, respectively. The system also achieves the lowest false alarm rate of 1 alarm per 59 h of usage, which is best till date.

<p>Extracting electric vehicle (EV) charging loads is an important aspect that enables smart grid operators to make informed and intelligent decisions about conserving power and promoting the reliability of the electrical grid. This paper presents an unsupervised algorithm to extract the EV charging loads (EVCLs) nonintrusively from the smart meter data. The proposed algorithm can run on low-frequency smart meter sampling data and only requires the real power measurement, which is the type of data communicated and recorded by most smart meters. Validation results on real aggregated household loads have shown that the proposed approach is a promising solution to extract EVCLs and that the approach can effectively mitigate the interference of other appliances that have similar load behaviors as EVs. Furthermore, the extraction of such load behaviors can be aggregated and open further smart grid analyses and studies.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>One of the major obstacles facing the large-scale integration of renewable energy sources to existing power networks is the large magnitude of fluctuations and uncertainties introduced to aggregated demand profiles. Such variations make the supply&#x2013;demand matching a more challenging task, and increase the operational cost of the power system. In this paper, we provide an effective, yet simple, methodology for smoothing power variations using the demand response of a large number of residential appliances. We first present a demand aggregation model based on queueing theory that can accommodate both deferrable and thermostatically controlled loads. Second, controllable demands are scheduled using an online algorithm to smooth the net noncontrollable demand profile. The performance of our methodology is evaluated using realistic data.

<p>Mobile cloud computing (MCC) allows mobile users to have on-demand access to cloud services. A mobile cloud model helps in analyzing the information regarding the patients&#x2019; records and also in extracting recommendations in healthcare applications. In MCC, a fine-grained level access control of multiserver cloud data is a prerequisite for successful execution of end-users applications. In this paper, we propose a new scheme that provides a combined approach of fine-grained access control over cloud-based multiserver data along with a provably secure mobile user authentication mechanism for the Healthcare Industry 4.0. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed scheme is the first to pursue fine-grained data access control over multiple cloud servers in a MCC environment. The proposed scheme has been validated extensively in different heterogeneous environment where its performance was found good in comparison to other existing schemes.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The inherent second-harmonic ripple power in a cascaded H-bridge (CHB)-based motor drive system poses the demand of large capacitors in the dc link of each cell. In this paper, an active power decoupling method based on negative sequence current injection and its corresponding dual voltage closed-loop control are proposed to solve this problem without adding any extra components. The proposed dual voltage closed-loop control system consists of a conventional active power control loop and a frequency-adaptive ripple power control loop. The ripple power control loop aims at injecting a set of negative sequence decoupling currents into the front ends of the cells to remove the ripple powers with variable frequency. Higher steady-state accuracy and robustness are, therefore, achieved compared to the open-loop control. Moreover, to simplify the control system, the ripple power control loop can be integrated into the active power control loop without introducing a harmonic reference frame transformation. By adopting the proposed control, the dc capacitance can be reduced to less than 10&#x0025; of the conventional case. The effectiveness and practicability of this method are verified by simulation and experimental results.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a novel oversampling deadbeat current control approach for permanent magnet synchronous motor drives capable of operating at a controller sampling frequency multiple of the power converter switching frequency. Model-based controllers suffer from heavy computational demand and performance degradation due to parameter uncertainties. The proposed controller concurrently with field-programmable gate array implementation permits to achieve a constant switching frequency and an optimal current ripple along with a high current-loop bandwidth and robust behavior to parameter variation. A disturbance observer has been added to the proposed controller in order to compensate for the converter voltage distortions. The proposed control strategy is tested through both simulations and experiments.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>High step-up converters are required for distributed photovoltaic generation systems, due to the low voltage of the photovoltaic source. In this paper, a new hybrid high voltage gain dc&#x2013;dc converter is created by merging the standard boost converter with a coupled inductor and different switched-capacitor techniques. With a single switch and no requirement of higher duty cycle values, the proposed converter achieves a high voltage gain and high efficiency, in addition to lowered voltage and current stresses of the components. A 200-W prototype was implemented experimentally to evaluate the converter, which reached a maximum efficiency of 97.6&#x0025;.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The employment of solar microconverter allows a more detailed monitoring of the photovoltaic (PV) output power at the single module level; thus, machine learning techniques are capable to track the peculiarities of modules in the PV plants, such as regular shadings. In this way, it is possible to compare in real time the day-ahead forecast power with the actual one in order to better evaluate faults or anomalous trends that might have occurred in the PV plant. This paper presents a method for an effective fault diagnosis; this method is based on the day-ahead forecast of the output power from an existing PV module, linked to a microconverter, and on the outcome of the neighbor PV modules. Finally, this paper also proposes the analysis of the most common error definitions with new mathematical formulations, by comparing their effectiveness and immediate comprehension, in view of increasing power forecasting accuracy and performing both real-time and offline analysis of PV modules performance and possible faults.
