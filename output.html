<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Smart home devices are vulnerable to passive inference attacks based on
network traffic, even in the presence of encryption. In this paper, we present
PingPong, a tool that can automatically extract packet-level signatures (i.e.,
simple sequences of packet lengths and directions) from the network traffic of
smart home devices, and use those signatures to detect occurrences of specific
device events (e.g., light bulb turning ON/OFF). We evaluated PingPong on
popular smart home devices ranging from smart plugs to thermostats and home
security systems. We have successfully: (1) extracted packet-level signatures
from 18 devices (11 of which are the most popular smart home devices on Amazon)
from 15 popular vendors, (2) used those signatures to detect occurrences of
specific device events with an average recall of more than 97%, and (3) shown
that the signatures are unique among tens of millions of packets of real world
network traffic.

<p>In the past decade analysis of big data has proven to be extremely valuable
in many contexts. Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is a state-of-the-art
approach which allows statistical computations while protecting each individual
user's privacy. Unlike Differential Privacy no trust in a central authority is
necessary as noise is added to user inputs locally. In this paper we give an
overview over different LDP algorithms for problems such as locally private
heavy hitter identification and spatial data collection. Finally, we will give
an outlook on open problems in LDP.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Security provisioning has become the most important design consideration for
large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems due to their critical roles to
support diverse vertical applications by connecting heterogenous devices,
machines and industry processes. Conventional authentication and authorization
schemes are insufficient in dealing the emerging IoT security challenges due to
their reliance on both static digital mechanisms and computational complexity
for improving security level. Furthermore, the isolated security designs for
different layers and link segments while ignoring the overall protection lead
to cascaded security risks as well as growing communication latency and
overhead. In this article, we envision new artificial intelligence (AI) enabled
security provisioning approaches to overcome these issues while achieving fast
authentication and progressive authorization. To be more specific, a
lightweight intelligent authentication approach is developed by exploring
machine learning at the gateway to identify the access time slots or
frequencies of resource-constraint devices. Then we propose a holistic
authentication and authorization approach, where online machine learning and
trust management are adopted for analyzing the complex dynamic environment and
achieving adaptive access control. These new AI enabled approaches establish
the connections between transceivers quickly and enhance security
progressively, so that communication latency can be reduced and security risks
are well-controlled in large-scale IoT. Finally, we outline several areas for
AI-enabled security provisioning for future researches.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep learning classifiers are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples.
A recent paper presented at ICML 2019 proposed a statistical test detection
method based on the observation that logits of noisy adversarial examples are
biased toward the true class. The method is evaluated on CIFAR-10 dataset and
is shown to achieve 99% true positive rate (TPR) at only 1% false positive rate
(FPR). In this paper, we first develop a classifier-based adaptation of the
statistical test method and show that it improves the detection performance. We
then propose Logit Mimicry Attack method to generate adversarial examples such
that their logits mimic those of benign images. We show that our attack
bypasses both statistical test and classifier-based methods, reducing their TPR
to less than 2:2% and 1:6%, respectively, even at 5% FPR. We finally show that
a classifier-based detector that is trained with logits of mimicry adversarial
examples can be evaded by an adaptive attacker that specifically targets the
detector. Furthermore, even a detector that is iteratively trained to defend
against adaptive attacker cannot be made robust, indicating that statistics of
logits cannot be used to detect adversarial examples.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We study the thermal quantum correlations in tripartite atomic system under
the existence of Herring-Flicker (HF) coupling among the atoms. We explore two
topologically distinct configurations of three coupled two-level atoms, viz.,
loop and line, differing in their coupling pattern. Further, the systems having
asymmetric arrangement of atoms are quantum mechanically correlated more
strongly than systems having symmetric arrangements. The variable nature of HF
coupling leads to the increase of both concurrence and discord from zero to a
saturation value from where they decrease to zero as a function of inter-atomic
distance. Further separation leads to both the quantities attaining another
saturation value. This controlled correlations play an important role in the
design of quantum data buses that can transfer quantum states to establish
quantum communication. The systems coupled via HF coupling will be efficient
for this task as they are maximally entangled in parametrically controlled
manner. Thus, these systems will be propitious for various quantum protocols
such as secure communication, quantum cryptography, quantum key distribution
etc.

<p>We commend the Collaborative Group for the Meta-Analysis of Individual Patient Data in MDR-TB treatment&#8211;20171 on their important findings but have questions about the analyses. We understand that individuals not given the drug under study were matched multiple times by propensity scoring to individuals to whom the drug was given. Did the investigators control for this multiple matching in their analyses? Some clarity on how the random effects used (described as a random intercept and random slope for matched pairs for the logistic, mixed-effects model) relates to random effect for the included studies would also be helpful.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Advancements in digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) technologies are paving the way for low-cost and automated platforms for implementing bio-protocols. However, the deployment of DMFBs outside of controlled settings will make them vulnerable to intellectual property (IP) theft. Bio-protocol development requires large investments for cross-domain innovations in biochemical analysis, microfluidics, and cyberphysical systems. We propose a watermarking technique for bio-protocol IP protection-a first in microfluidics-that hierarchically embeds a secret signature across these domains. Such a signature can be exclusively attributed to the owner (like a hash). The proposed solution takes into account the inherent variability in domain-specific parameters such as mixing ratio, sensor calibration, and incubation time. We describe watermarking techniques of varying complexities for different bio-protocol steps. These include watermarking for bio-protocol synthesis parameters and the cyberphysical systems control path parameters. A watermarking scheme based on integer linear programming is proposed for the sample-preparation step of a bio-protocol. The practicality of our solution is demonstrated through case studies involving an immunoassay and several mixing ratios required in the sample-preparation process of bio-protocols. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated through various security metrics: proof of ownership score, the probability of successful tampering of the watermark, and the probability of coincidence. We also analyze the integrity of the watermark against various possible attacks: brute force search, the insertion of a new watermark, and the watermarking of more parameters.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we present a spatial-temporal attention-aware learning (STAL) method for video-based person re-identification. Most existing person re-identification methods aggregate image features identically to represent persons, which are extracted from the same receptive field across video frames. However, the image quality may be varying for different spatial regions and changing over time, which shall contribute to person representation and matching adaptively. Our STAL method aims to attend to the salient parts of persons in videos jointly in both spatial and temporal domains. To achieve this, we slice the video into multiple spatial-temporal units which preserve the body structure of a person and develop a joint spatial-temporal attention model to learn the quality scores of these units. We evaluate the proposed method on three challenging datasets including iLIDS-VID, PRID-2011, and the large-scale MARS dataset, and consistently improve the rank-1 accuracy by a large margin of 5.7%, 0.9%, and 6.6% respectively, in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Given a reference color image and a destination grayscale image, this paper presents a novel automatic colorization algorithm that transfers color information from the reference image to the destination image. Since the reference and destination images may contain content at different or even varying scales (due to changes of distance between objects and the camera), existing texture matching-based methods can often perform poorly. We propose a novel cross-scale texture matching method to improve the robustness and quality of the colorization results. Suitable matching scales are considered locally, which are then fused using global optimization that minimizes both the matching errors and spatial change of scales. The minimization is efficiently solved using a multi-label graph-cut algorithm. Since only low-level texture features are used, texture matching-based colorization can still produce semantically incorrect results, such as meadow appearing above the sky. We consider a class of semantic violation where the statistics of up-down relationships learned from the reference image are violated and propose an effective method to identify and correct unreasonable colorization. Finally, a novel nonlocal  $ell _{1}$  optimization framework is developed to propagate high confidence micro-scribbles to regions of lower confidence to produce a fully colorized image. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA) addresses the task of associating data not only across dissimilar domains but also described by different types of features. Inspired by the recent advances of neural networks and deep learning, we propose a deep leaning model of transfer neural trees (TNT), which jointly solves cross-domain feature mapping, adaptation, and classification in a unified architecture. As the prediction layer in TNT, we introduce transfer neural decision forest (transfer-NDF), which is able to learn the neurons in TNT for adaptation by stochastic pruning. In order to handle semi-supervised HDA, a unique embedding loss term is introduced to TNT for preserving prediction and structural consistency between labeled and unlabeled target-domain data. Furthermore, we show that our TNT can be extended to zero shot learning for associating image and attribute data with promising performance. Finally, experiments on different classification tasks across features, datasets, and modalities would verify the effectiveness of our TNT.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents an improved secondary voltage control (SVC) methodology incorporating compressive sensing (CS) for a multiarea power system. SVC minimizes the voltage deviation of the load buses while CS deals with the problem of the limited bandwidth capacity of the communication channel by reducing the size of massive data output from the phasor measurement unit (PMU) based monitoring system. The proposed strategy further incorporates the application of a morphological median filter (MMF) to reduce noise from the output of the PMUs. To keep the control area secure and protected locally, mathematical singular entropy (MSE) based fault identification approach is utilized for fast discovery of faults in the control area. Simulation results with 27-bus and 486-bus power systems show that CS can reduce the data size up to 1/10th while the MSE-based fault identification technique can accurately distinguish between fault and steady-state conditions.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Filgotinib is an oral, small-molecule inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK)&#8211;signal transducer and activator of transcription, JAK1, one of the several subtypes of the enzyme. Four JAKs exist in humans: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and nonreceptor tyrosine-protein kinase TYK2. These kinases bind to types I and II cytokine receptors and transmit extracellular cytokine signals to activate various signal transducers and activators of transcription, which drive the proinflammatory machinery of the cellular immune response. Two other JAK inhibitor drugs, tofacitinib and baricitinib, have been approved in the United States for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Tofacitinib preferentially inhibits JAK1, JAK3, and to a lesser extent JAK2. Baricitinib inhibits JAK1 and JAK2.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Dynamic software watermarking is one of the major countermeasures against software licensing violations. However, conventional dynamic watermarking approaches have exhibited a number of weaknesses including exploitable payload semantics, exploitable embedding/recognition procedures, and weak correlation between payload and subject software. This paper presents a novel dynamic watermarking method, Xmark, which leverages a well-known unsolved mathematical problem referred to as the Collatz conjecture. Our method works by transforming selected conditional constructs (which originally belonged to the software to be watermarked) with a control flow obfuscation technique based on Collatz conjecture. These obfuscation routines are built in a particular way such that they are able to express a watermark in the form of iteratively executed branching activities occurred during computing the aforementioned conjecture. Exploiting the one-to-one correspondence between natural numbers and their orbits computed by the conjecture (also known as the &#x201c;Hailstone sequences&#x201d;), Xmark's watermark-related activities are designed to be insignificant without the pre-defined secret input. Meanwhile, being integrated with obfuscation techniques, our method is able to resist attacks based on various reverse engineering techniques on both syntax and semantic levels. Analyses and simulations indicated that Xmark could evade detections via pattern matching and model checking, and meanwhile effectively prohibit dynamic symbolic execution. We have also shown that our method could remain robust even if a watermarked software is compromised via re-obfuscation using approaches like control flow flattening.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Age synthesis is a challenging task due to the complicated and non-linear transformation in the human aging process. Aging information is usually reflected in local facial parts, such as wrinkles at the eye corners. However, these local facial parts contribute less in previous GAN-based methods for age synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet-domain global and local consistent age generative adversarial network (WaveletGLCA-GAN), in which one global specific network and three local specific networks are integrated together to capture both global topology information and local texture details of human faces. Different from the most existing methods that modeling age synthesis in image domain, we adopt wavelet transform to depict the textual information in frequency domain. Moreover, five types of losses are adopted: 1) adversarial loss aims to generate realistic wavelets; 2) identity preserving loss aims to better preserve identity information; 3) age preserving loss aims to enhance the accuracy of age synthesis; 4) pixel-wise loss aims to preserve the background information of the input face; and 5) the total variation regularization aims to remove ghosting artifacts. Our method is evaluated on three face aging datasets, including CACD2000, Morph, and FG-NET. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show the superiority of the proposed method over other state-of-the-arts.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the increasing connectivity enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), security becomes a critical concern, and users should invest to secure their IoT applications. Due to the massive devices in the IoT network, users cannot be aware of the security policies taken by all its connected neighbors. Instead, a user makes security decisions based on the cyber risks that he perceives by observing a selected number of nodes. To this end, we propose a model which incorporates the limited attention or bounded rationality nature of players in the IoT. Specifically, each individual builds a sparse cognitive network of nodes to respond to. Based on this simplified cognitive network representation, each user then determines his security management policy by minimizing his own real-world security cost. The bounded rational decision-makings of players and their cognitive network formations are interdependent and thus should be addressed in a holistic manner. We establish a games-in-games framework and propose a Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE) solution concept to characterize the decisions of agents and quantify their risk of bounded perception due to the limited attention. In addition, we design a proximal-based iterative algorithm to compute the GNE. With case studies of smart communities, the designed algorithm can successfully identify the critical users whose decisions need to be taken into account by the other users during the security management.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper considers the scenario that multiple data owners wish to apply a machine learning method over the combined dataset of all owners to obtain the best possible learning output but do not want to share the local datasets owing to privacy concerns. We design systems for the scenario that the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm is used as the machine learning method, because SGD (or its variants) is at the heart of recent deep learning techniques over neural networks. Our systems differ from the existing systems in the following features: 1) any activation function can be used, meaning that no privacy-preserving-friendly approximation is required; 2) gradients computed by SGD are not shared but the weight parameters are shared instead; and 3) robustness against colluding parties even in the extreme case that only one honest party exists. One of our systems requires a shared symmetric key among the data owners (trainers) to ensure the secrecy of the weight parameters against a central server. We prove that our systems, while privacy preserving, achieve the same learning accuracy as SGD and, hence, retain the merit of deep learning with respect to accuracy. Finally, we conduct several experiments using benchmark datasets and show that our systems outperform the previous system in terms of learning accuracies.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Industrial and commercial electricity customers have significant potential in providing flexibility for power systems through diverse demand response (DR) programs. However, the industrial and commercial potential of DR is not yet completely understood, especially regarding the emerging and advanced technologies associated with the smart grid. Advances in smart meter technology that allow monitoring and controlling responsive loads in real time will also be key enablers of DR potential. It can be more complex to implement DR for industrial loads if compared to residential loads mainly due to the reliability management that is more vital for industrial plants. Hence, this paper aims at providing a comprehensive review of the most recent advances on industrial and commercial DR. On this basis, this survey first presents the potential and technologies of DR in industrial and commercial sectors. Then, the existing models of DR in the mentioned sectors are presented. The presence of industrial and commercial DR in electricity markets is also investigated. Finally, the main positive and beneficial aspects, as well as challenges and barriers of industrial and commercial DR, are investigated.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes an optimal power scheduling strategy for cooperative operation of multiple-coupled microgrids, where the microgrid coalition makes day-ahead energy exchange commitments with the grid. Deviations from their commitments are limited by penalizing the microgrids. Various system intermittencies are captured via scenarios. The framework aims at maximizing the expected profit of each microgrid, while mitigating the distribution power losses by enabling local power trades between all microgrids within a coalition. The scheduling problem only utilizes the power exchange requests as the control signals between participating microgrids. Extensive numerical results are presented to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The growing number of attacks against cyber-physical systems in recent years elevates the concern for cybersecurity of industrial control systems (ICSs). The current efforts of ICS cybersecurity are mainly based on firewalls, data diodes, and other methods of intrusion prevention, which may not be sufficient for growing cyber threats from motivated attackers. To enhance the cybersecurity of ICS, a cyber-attack detection system built on the concept of defense-in-depth is developed utilizing network traffic data, host system data, and measured process parameters. This attack detection system provides multiple-layer defense in order to gain the defenders precious time before unrecoverable consequences occur in the physical system. The data used for demonstrating the proposed detection system are from a real-time ICS testbed. Five attacks, including man in the middle (MITM), denial of service (DoS), data exfiltration, data tampering, and false data injection, are carried out to simulate the consequences of cyber attack and generate data for building data-driven detection models. Four classical classification models based on network data and host system data are studied, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree, bootstrap aggregating (bagging), and random forest (RF), to provide a secondary line of defense of cyber-attack detection in the event that the intrusion prevention layer fails. Intrusion detection results suggest that KNN, bagging, and RF have low missed alarm and false alarm rates for MITM and DoS attacks, providing accurate and reliable detection of these cyber attacks. Cyber attacks that may not be detectable by monitoring network and host system data, such as command tampering and false data injection attacks by an insider, are monitored for by traditional process monitoring protocols. In the proposed detection system, an auto-associative kernel regression model is studied to strengthen early attack detection. The result shows that this approach de-
ects physically impactful cyber attacks before significant consequences occur. The proposed multiple-layer data-driven cyber-attack detection system utilizing network, system, and process data is a promising solution for safeguarding an ICS.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Energy imbalance market (EIM) provides an opportunity that allows larger shares of variable renewable energy sources in the grid. Under highly volatile weather conditions, an accurate forecasting of photovoltaic (PV) power is necessary for grid stability and market operation. Most of existing forecasting methods strongly rely on the accuracy of measurements, and the adaptability of these methods to complex weather conditions is rarely discussed. In this paper, a weather classification multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) forecasting model is introduced for complex weather conditions in all seasons. It can be updated incrementally and its high computational efficiency satisfies EIM operations. A data set that consists of the historical power and meteorological parameters produced by a small-scale PV platform is classified and used to train MARS models with forecast horizons ranging from 15 min to 24 h in different seasons. The tests and analyses results indicate higher accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency of the novel model.

<p>In this paper, a two-degrees-of-freedom control algorithm based on uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE), aimed to minimize the total harmonic distortion of inverter output voltage is proposed, possessing enhanced robustness to fundamental frequency variations. A multiple-time-delay action is combined with a commonly utilized low-pass UDE filter to increase the range of output impedance magnitude minimization around odd multiples of fundamental frequency for enhanced rejection of typical single-phase nonlinear loads harmonics. Marginal robustness improvement achieved by increasing the number of time delays is quantified analytically and revealed to be independent of delay order. The performance of the proposed control approach and its superiority over two recently proposed methods is validated successfully by experimental results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The back-to-back (BTB) converter is one of the most popular converter topologies for the control of electrical machines, power transmission systems, and power quality applications. The conventional cascade control structure is commonly used due to its simple design procedure and reliable operation. However, the bandwidth of the dc-link voltage controller has to be limited in order to avoid instability issues and be restrictive in high-performance applications. This paper presents a differential- and common-current (power)-based state-feedback control for BTB converters. This controller features a fast control of active and reactive powers, and a stiff regulation of the dc-link voltage. A theoretical analysis of the proposed controller along with a strategy for current limiting is presented. Its robustness was tested against variations of the filter parameters, the dc capacitance, the grid inductance, and the grid voltage values. The controller was experimentally validated under nominal operation, voltage sags, and connected to a weak grid by using a 15-kVA BTB converter in a laboratory test network.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Power electronics-based medium-voltage direct current (MVdc) microgrids consist of several interconnected feedback-controlled switching converters. Such systems experience bus voltage stability challenges owing to the negative incremental resistance of constant power loads and converter control loop interactions. To tackle the stability challenges, this paper presents the application of the interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) approach to the port-controlled Hamiltonian model of dual active bridge (DAB) source-side converters in an MVdc microgrid. For the DABs, a fundamental average model approach considering phase shift modulation is provided and used for deriving the corresponding IDA-PBC control law. We analyze the effectiveness of the controller on large signal scenarios considering disturbances such as load step up, and DAB disconnection. Hardware-in-the-Loop experiments using Opal-RT and Labview field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), as well as, low power prototype tests are carried out to demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed approach.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a coordinated droop control method through virtual voltage axis is proposed for voltage restoration and energy management of dc microgrids (MGs). Droop control is a control method that operates a dc MG using only local information. However, there are several drawbacks in that output voltage deviations occur, and the utilization priorities of various sources are not considered. To solve these problems, the voltage compensation term is defined as the virtual axis voltage value. It can minimize the voltage deviation of the dc MG and enable energy management by determining the operation band. However, the value of the virtual voltage axis is affected by communication delays. Therefore, its influence on the values of the virtual voltage axis was analyzed. The reference voltage and the droop gain of the droop control were designed, and the validity of the proposed method was verified using a lab-scale dc MG.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we present a multichannel cross-modal fusion algorithm to combine two complementary modalities in electron tomography: X-ray spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The former reveals compositions with high elemental specificity but low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while the latter characterizes the structure with high SNR but little chemical information. We use a multivariate regression to build a cross-modal fusion framework for these two modalities to simultaneously achieve high elemental specificity and high SNR for a target element chosen from the sample under study. Specifically, we first compute three-dimensional tomograms from tilt-series datasets of X-ray and STEM using different reconstruction algorithms. Then, we generate many feature images from each tomogram. Finally, we adopt partial least squares regression to assess the connection between these feature images and the reconstruction of the target element. Based on the simulated and experimental datasets of semiconductor devices, we demonstrate that our algorithm can not only produce continuous edges, homogeneous foreground, and clean background in its element-specific reconstructions but also can more accurately preserve fine structures than state-of-the-art tomography techniques. Moreover, we show that it can deliver results with high fidelity even for X-ray datasets with limited tilts or low counts. This property is highly desired in the semiconductor industry where acquisition time and sample damage are essential.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Capturing images at high ISO modes will introduce much realistic noise, which is difficult to be removed by traditional denoising methods. In this paper, we propose a novel denoising method for high ISO JPEG images via deep fusion of collaborative and convolutional filtering. Collaborative filtering explores the non-local similarity of natural images, while convolutional filtering takes advantage of the large capacity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to infer noise from noisy images. We observe that the noise variance map of a high ISO JPEG image is spatial-dependent and has a Bayer-like pattern. Therefore, we introduce the Bayer pattern prior in our noise estimation and collaborative filtering stages. Since collaborative filtering is good at recovering repeatable structures and convolutional filtering is good at recovering irregular patterns and removing noise in flat regions, we propose to fuse the strengths of the two methods via deep CNN. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art realistic noise removal methods for a wide variety of testing images in both subjective and objective measurements. In addition, we construct a dataset with noisy and clean image pairs for high ISO JPEG images to facilitate research on this topic.
