<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been vastly employed in the collection
and transmission of data via wireless networks. This type of network is
nowadays used in many applications for surveillance activities in various
environments due to its low cost and easy communications. In these networks,
the sensors use a limited power source which after its depletion, since it is
non-renewable, network lifetime ends. Due to the weaknesses in sensor nodes,
they are vulnerable to many threats. One notable attack threating WSN is Denial
of Sleep (DoS). DoS attacks denotes the loss of energy in these sensors by
keeping the nodes from going into sleep and energy-saving mode. In this paper,
the Abnormal Sensor Detection Accuracy (ASDA-RSA) method is utilised to
counteract DoS attacks to reducing the amount of energy consumed. The ASDA-RSA
schema in this paper consists of two phases to enhancement security in the
WSNs. In the first phase, a clustering approach based on energy and distance is
used to select the proper cluster head and in the second phase, the RSA
cryptography algorithm and interlock protocol are used here along with an
authentication method, to prevent DoS attacks. Moreover, ASDA-RSA method is
evaluated here via extensive simulations carried out in NS-2. The simulation
results indicate that the WSN network performance metrics are improved in terms
of average throughput, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), network lifetime, detection
ratio, and average residual energy.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the rapid development of various emerging technologies such as the
Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), there is a need to secure communications
between such devices. Communication system delays are one of the factors that
adversely affect the performance of an authentication system. 5G networks
enable greater data throughput and lower latency, which presents new
opportunities for the secure authentication of business transactions between
IIoT devices. We evaluate an approach to developing a flexible and secure model
for authenticating IIoT components in dynamic 5G environments.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We improve the fundamental security threshold of Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
blockchain protocols, reflecting for the first time the positive effect of
rounds with multiple honest leaders. Current analyses of the longest-chain rule
in PoS blockchain protocols reduce consistency to the dynamics of an abstract,
round-based block creation process determined by three probabilities: $p_A$,
the probability that a round has at least one adversarial leader; $p_h$, the
probability that a round has a single honest leader; and $p_H$, the probability
that a round has multiple, but honest, leaders. We present a consistency
analysis that achieves the optimal threshold $p_h + p_H &gt; p_A$. This is a first
in the literature and can be applied to both the simple synchronous setting and
the setting with bounded delays. We also achieve the optimal consistency error
$e^{-\Theta(k)}$, $k$ being the confirmation time.
</p>
<p>The consistency analyses in Ouroboros Praos (Eurocrypt 2018) and Genesis (CCS
2018) assume that $p_h - p_H &gt; p_A$; the analyses in Sleepy Consensus
(Asiacrypt 2017) and Snow White (Fin. Crypto 2019) assume that $p_h &gt; p_A$.
Thus existing analyses either incur a penalty for multiply-honest rounds, or
treat them neutrally. In addition, previous analyses completely break down when
$p_h &lt; p_A$. Our new results can be directly applied to improve the consistency
of these existing protocols. We emphasize that these thresholds determine the
critical tradeoff between honest majority, network delays, and consistency
error.
</p>
<p>We complement our results with a consistency analysis in the setting where
uniquely honest slots are rare, event letting $p_h = 0$, under the added
assumption that honest players adopt a consistent chain selection rule. Our
analysis provides a direct connection between the Ouroboros analysis focusing
on "relative margin" and the Sleepy analysis focusing on "strong pivots."

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Internet of Things (IoT) networks are becoming a part of our daily lives and
the number of IoT devices around us are surging. The authentication of millions
of connected things and the distribution and management of shared keys between
these devices pose challenging research problems. Current one-to-one
authentication schemes do not take the resource limitations of IoT devices into
consideration. Nor do they address the scalability problem of massive machine
type communication (mMTC) networks. Group authentication schemes (GAS), on the
other hand, have emerged as novel approaches for many-to-many authentication
problems. They can be used to simultaneously authenticate many
resource-constrained devices. However, existing group authentication schemes
are not energy efficient, and they do not provide enough security for
widespread use. In this paper, we propose a lightweight GAS that significantly
reduces energy consumption on devices, providing almost 80% energy savings
compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. Our approach is resistant to the
common replay and man-in-the-middle attacks.. The proposed approach also
includes a solution for key agreement and distribution in mMTC environments.
Moreover, this approach can be used in both centralized and decentralized group
authentication scenarios.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The evolution of the utilization of technologies in nearly all aspects of
life has produced an enormous amount of data essential in a smart city.
Therefore, maximizing the benefits of technologies such as cloud computing, fog
computing, and the Internet of things is important to manage and manipulate
data in smart cities. However, certain types of data are sensitive and risky
and may be infiltrated by malicious attacks. As a result, such data may be
corrupted, thereby causing concern. The damage inflicted by an attacker on a
set of data can spread through an entire database. Valid transactions that have
read corrupted data can update other data items based on the values read. In
this study, we introduce a unique model that uses fog computing in smart cities
to manage utility service companies and consumer data. We also propose a novel
technique to assess damage to data caused by an attack. Thus, original data can
be recovered, and a database can be returned to its consistent state as no
attacking has occurred.

<p>In Reply Based on the letters from Mr Schneider, Drs Everett and Isea, and Dr Battisti, we find 2 key issues to discuss&#8212;transparency and competency. We absolutely agree that increased transparency and access to data, both from medical schools and through ERAS, would facilitate holistic review. Program directors have been lamenting the erosion of meaningful performance measures for years as medical schools increasingly moved to pass-fail grading. We wonder what role the narrow focus on academic metrics in residency selection may have played during this transition. Broadening the selection criteria beyond academic metrics in true holistic review may be a more successful approach for encouraging data release than further demands for score details. Realistic solutions include use of additional information already collected by ERAS, such as student experiences (volunteer work, research productivity) and attributes (language skills, regional ties, distance traveled), to filter applicants for review. Once a reasonable number of applications is identified, each can be individually assessed for mission-specific factors including medical knowledge.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To the Editor The recent Recommendation Statement by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) on risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility (BRCA) gene mutations seems to contain some internal inconsistencies. The Summary of Recommendations and Evidence section stated that women with either a personal or family history of BRCA-related cancers or an ancestry associated with BRCA mutations are recommended for risk assessment. However, in the USPSTF Assessment section, net benefit of the intervention was only ascribed to women with the relevant family or personal history, and it was stated that the harms of risk assessment outweigh the benefits &#8220;in women whose family or personal history is not associated with an increased risk&#8221; for harmful BRCA mutations. Therefore, the task force appears to be recommending intervention for women with a BRCA-associated ancestry but no personal or family history (since such women satisfy the &#8220;or&#8221; logic in the recommendation) but also stating that the harms outweigh the benefits for these women. Another sentence in the text, under Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit, excluded even personal history, stating that the harms of risk assessment outweigh the benefits for women without a BRCA-associated family history. Although readers could presume that the task force would consider these interventions to have net benefit in women with the requisite ancestry but no relevant family or personal history, it is curious that these direct statements would exclude mention of ancestry. It would be helpful if the task force could provide added clarity with regard to these net benefit statements and their relation to the overall recommendation.

<p>To the Editor Dr Swails and colleagues argued that the current 3-digit scoring system for the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) is a broken metric for evaluating residency applicants. They suggested that a pass-fail licensing examination with &#8220;individual mission&#8211;based holistic criteria&#8221; would be more appropriate. I disagree with their suggestion for several reasons.

<p>The introduction of the direct oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and the management of thromboembolism has transformed the care of patients with these disorders. These drugs, which selectively and reversibly inhibit factor Xa or thrombin in the common pathway of the coagulation cascade, have a wide therapeutic window; this allows for simplified dosing regimens without laboratory monitoring of most adult patients as contrasted to vitamin K antagonists. This class of drug is also associated with a lower bleeding risk than vitamin K antagonists, which has been most clearly demonstrated by a 50% relative risk reduction in intracranial hemorrhage. Nevertheless, bleeding with the direct oral anticoagulants remains a clinically significant issue, particularly in vulnerable patient populations, such as older patients and those with renal dysfunction.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We study the trade-off between secret message (SM) and secret key (SK) rates, simultaneously achievable over a state-dependent (SD) wiretap channel (WTC) with non-causal channel state information (CSI) at the encoder. This model subsumes other instances of CSI availability as special cases, and calls for efficient utilization of the state sequence for both reliability and security purposes. An inner bound on the semantic-security (SS) SM-SK capacity region is derived based on a superposition coding scheme inspired by a past work of the authors. The region is shown to attain capacity for a certain class of SD-WTCs. SS is established by virtue of two versions of the strong soft-covering lemma. The derived region yields an improvement upon the previously best known SM-SK trade-off result reported by Prabhakaran et al., and, to the best of our knowledge, upon all other existing lower bounds for either SM or SK for this setup, even if the semantic security requirement is relaxed to weak secrecy. It is demonstrated that our region can be strictly larger than those reported in the preceding works.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recently, axial displacement detection of transformer winding has been performed using synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) imaging, as an online method, in ultra-wideband frequency band. Another important problem in power transformers is partial discharge (PD), which emits signal in the ultra-high-frequency (UHF) frequency band. If detection of axial displacement using SAR imaging can be applied to the UHF band, both defects can be detected using only one set of antennas and application of these methods can be more economic. However, as shown in this paper, using the same frequency band for detection of both defects leads to wrong conclusions about winding conditions, if PD is occurred during the application of SAR imaging. As a solution, UHF stepped-frequency imaging method and generalized likelihood ratio test method are proposed for detection of axial displacement. Finally, on a three-phase real transformer both defects are simultaneously detected using designed monitoring system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper addresses the problem of sensor selection in a sensor network for tracking a moving target. By considering network uncertainties and unpredictable movements of the target, reliable sensor selection approaches such as sigma points probability and target trajectory are proposed. An updated unscented Kalman filter is proposed to achieve effective tracking of the target through the sensor selection. A multialgorithm genetically adaptive multiobjective is utilized to have a selection strategy without knowing the number of sensors to be selected. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach both in simulation and practical experimentation. The proposed algorithm is also tested in the industrial setting where providing safety is of great importance for a human worker who walks in a potentially dangerous workplace. The results confirm the effectiveness and utility of the proposed scheme.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The mission abort is an effective action to reduce the risk of casualties and enhance the survivability of mission-based systems such as aircrafts, submarines, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A main task in real operations is to strive for balance between the mission reliability and the system survivability via elaborate mission abort plans. In this paper, we design the optimal mission abort policies based on the information of early-warning signals, which indicates the possible forthcoming fatal malfunction. Depending on the acquisition time of such information, the operator may immediately abort the mission, or ignore the information and continue the task. Within the framework of a constant mission duration, we carry out an economic analysis for the above problem. The optimal abort decision that minimizes the expected total economic loss is investigated. We further extend the proposed model to the scenario of a random mission duration and derive the corresponding optimal abort decisions. A case study on a UAV executing power-grid inspection missions is used to illustrate the applicability of the abort policies.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In the power industry, processing business big data from geographically distributed locations, such as online line-loss analysis, has emerged as an important application. How to achieve highly efficient big data storage to meet the requirements of low latency processing applications is quite challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive power storage replica management system, named PARMS, based on stochastic configuration networks (SCNs), in which the network traffic and the data center (DC) geodistribution are taken into consideration to improve data real-time processing. First, as a fast learning model with less computation burden and sound prediction performance, the SCN model is employed to estimate the traffic state of power data networks. Then, a series of data replica management algorithms is proposed to lower the effects of limited bandwidths and a fixed underlying infrastructure. Finally, the proposed PARMS is implemented using data-parallel computing frameworks (DCFs) for the power industry. Experiments are carried out in an electric power corporation of 230 million users, China Southern power grid, and the results show that our proposed solution can deal with power big data storage efficiently and the job completion times across geodistributed DCs are reduced by 12.19&#x0025; on average.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In order to solve the problem of low detection accuracy of small targets in the SSD detection algorithm, a pipeline magnetic flux leakage image detection algorithm based on multiscale SSD network is proposed in this paper. The dilated convolution and attention residual module are introduced into the SSD algorithm to fuse the low-resolution high-semantic information feature map with the high-resolution low-semantic information feature map so as to improve the resolution of the low-resolution feature map and provide detailed features for small targets. Finally, the target location and category are obtained by regression algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can automatically identify the location of circumferential weld, spiral weld, and defect of magnetic flux leakage data. Compared with the original SSD algorithm framework, the improved algorithm has higher detection accuracy, 97.62&#x0025;, 18.01&#x0025; lower false detection rate, 18.36&#x0025; lower false detection rate, better robustness, and obvious effect on small target detection.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims at matching person images captured in non-overlapping camera views. To represent person appearance, low-level visual features are sensitive to environmental changes, while high-level semantic attributes, such as &#x201c;short-hair&#x201d; or &#x201c;long-hair&#x201d;, are relatively stable. Hence, researches have started to design semantic attributes to reduce the visual ambiguity. However, to train a prediction model for semantic attributes, it requires plenty of annotations, which are hard to obtain in practical large-scale applications. To alleviate the reliance on annotation efforts, we propose to incrementally generate Deep Hidden Attribute (DHA) based on baseline deep network for newly uncovered annotations. In particular, we propose an auto-encoder model that can be plugged into any deep network to mine latent information in an unsupervised manner. To optimize the effectiveness of DHA, we reform the auto-encoder model with additional orthogonal generation module, along with identity-preserving and sparsity constraints. 1) Orthogonally generating: In order to make DHAs different from each other, Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD) is introduced to generate DHAs orthogonally. 2) Identity-preserving constraint: The generated DHAs should be distinct for telling different persons, so we associate DHAs with person identities. 3) Sparsity constraint: To enhance the discriminability of DHAs, we also introduce the sparsity constraint to restrict the number of effective DHAs for each person. Experiments conducted on public datasets have validated the effectiveness of the proposed network. On two large-scale datasets, i.e., Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Most whole-slide histological images are stained with two or more chemical dyes. Slide stain separation or color deconvolution is a crucial step within the digital pathology workflow. In this paper, the blind color deconvolution problem is formulated within the Bayesian framework. Starting from a multi-stained histological image, our model takes into account both spatial relations among the concentration image pixels and similarity between a given reference color-vector matrix and the estimated one. Using Variational Bayes inference, three efficient new blind color deconvolution methods are proposed which provide automated procedures to estimate all the model parameters in the problem. A comparison with classical and current state-of-the-art color deconvolution algorithms using real images has been carried out demonstrating the superiority of the proposed approach.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Learning an effective distance measurement between sample pairs plays an important role in visual analysis, where the training procedure largely relies on hard negative samples. However, hard negative samples usually account for the tiny minority in the training set, which may fail to fully describe the data distribution close to the decision boundary. In this paper, we present a deep adversarial metric learning (DAML) framework to generate synthetic hard negatives from the original negative samples, which is widely applicable to existing supervised deep metric learning algorithms. Different from existing sampling strategies which simply ignore numerous easy negatives, our DAML aim to exploit them by generating synthetic hard negatives adversarial to the learned metric as complements. We simultaneously train the feature embedding and hard negative generator in an adversarial manner, so that adequate and targeted synthetic hard negatives are created to learn more precise distance metrics. As a single transformation may not be powerful enough to describe the global input space under the attack of the hard negative generator, we further propose a deep adversarial multi-metric learning (DAMML) method by learning multiple local transformations for more complete description. We simultaneously exploit the collaborative and competitive relationships among multiple metrics, where the metrics display unity against the generator for effective distance measurement as well as compete for more training data through a metric discriminator to avoid overlapping. Extensive experimental results on five benchmark datasets show that our DAML and DAMML effectively boost the performance of existing deep metric learning approaches through adversarial learning.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We propose Mask SSD, an efficient and effective approach to address the challenging instance segmentation task. Based on a single-shot detector, Mask SSD detects all instances in an image and marks the pixels that belong to each instance. It consists of a detection subnetwork that predicts object categories and bounding box locations, and an instance-level segmentation subnetwork that generates the foreground mask for each instance. In the detection subnetwork, multi-scale and feedback features from different layers are used to better represent objects of various sizes and provide high-level semantic information. Then, we adopt an assistant classification network to guide per-class score prediction, which consists of objectness prior and category likelihood. The instance-level segmentation subnetwork outputs pixel-wise segmentation for each detection while providing the multi-scale and feedback features from different layers as input. These two subnetworks are jointly optimized by a multi-task loss function, which renders Mask SSD direct prediction on detection and segmentation results. We conduct extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC, SBD, and MS COCO datasets to evaluate the performance of Mask SSD. Experimental results verify that as compared with state-of-the-art approaches, our proposed method has a comparable precision with less speed overhead.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Convolutional operator learning is gaining attention in many signal processing and computer vision applications. Learning kernels has mostly relied on so-called patch-domain approaches that extract and store many overlapping patches across training signals. Due to memory demands, patch-domain methods have limitations when learning kernels from large datasets &#x2013; particularly with multi-layered structures, e.g., convolutional neural networks &#x2013; or when applying the learned kernels to high-dimensional signal recovery problems. The so-called convolution approach does not store many overlapping patches, and thus overcomes the memory problems particularly with careful algorithmic designs; it has been studied within the &#x201c;synthesis&#x201d; signal model, e.g., convolutional dictionary learning. This paper proposes a new convolutional analysis operator learning (CAOL) framework that learns an analysis sparsifying regularizer with the convolution perspective, and develops a new convergent Block Proximal Extrapolated Gradient method using a Majorizer (BPEG-M) to solve the corresponding block multi-nonconvex problems. To learn diverse filters within the CAOL framework, this paper introduces an orthogonality constraint that enforces a tight-frame filter condition, and a regularizer that promotes diversity between filters. Numerical experiments show that, with sharp majorizers, BPEG-M significantly accelerates the CAOL convergence rate compared to the state-of-the-art block proximal gradient (BPG) method. Numerical experiments for sparse-view computational tomography show that a convolutional sparsifying regularizer learned via CAOL significantly improves reconstruction quality compared to a conventional edge-preserving regularizer. Using more and wider kernels in a learned regularizer better preserves edges in reconstructed images.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Squirrel-cage induction motor (SQIM) fed by a pulsewidth modulated voltage source inverter (VSI) is subjected to voltage and current surges. It may cause additional losses in the motor, insulation failure, high bearing current, and electromagnetic interference. To mitigate these problems, sinusoidal LC filter is placed at the ac-side of the VSI. This paper proposes a new methodology to design the filter. In this method, the filter inductance is chosen based on the maximum ripple in the inverter ac-side current and the voltage drop across the filter inductor, and the filter capacitor is chosen based on the steady-state reactive power demand of the SQIM. The effects of the designed filter on the switch current, losses in the drive, temperature of the dc-link capacitor, dv&#x002f;dt at the motor terminal, stator flux, and air-gap torque of the SQIM are discussed. The performance of the drive with the filters, designed by the proposed method and the standard method, are experimentally tested on a two-level silicon carbide VSI-fed SQIM and comparative analysis is carried out. The impact of the designed filter on the drive is also shown when the neutral point of the filter capacitors is connected with the mid-point of the dc link. The stability of the closed-loop controlled SQIM drive with the proposed filter, and simulation results are presented to verify its performance.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>For high-speed permanent magnet machines (HSPMMs), the permanent magnet (PM) is more likely to suffer irreversible demagnetization because the heat dissipation is serious in the HSPMMs, especially for the high-power machines. This paper focuses on the comprehensive research results on the power loss and thermal characteristic for a high-power HSPMM. First, the power loss at the rated load is investigated by finite-element analysis. Then, the temperature distribution of four cooling schemes is compared by the electromagnetic-thermal iteration calculation. The effect of different parameters on thermal behavior is obtained to reduce rotor temperature, which includes an examination of the axial flow duct, cooling medium, sleeve thickness, and sleeve thermal conductivity. Finally, an improved loss separation method is employed to obtain the loss distribution from the measured total loss, and the comprehensive experiments are implemented based on one HSPMM prototype (800 kW, 15 000 rpm) to verify the related theoretical analysis.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Differential power processing (DPP) is a promising architecture to solve the issue caused by mismatches among photovoltaic (PV) submodules. To eliminate the mismatch power losses, this paper presents an optimized PV-to-bus DPP system with submodule-level individual maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and module-level minimum-power tracking (MPT) simultaneous implementation according to the built mathematical model of the power processed by DPP converters with respect to the string current. Furthermore, a flexible time-sharing algorithm is adopted to reduce the number of MPPT units. Compared with other solutions, such as PV optimizer, the proposed scheme can reduce the effects of mismatches to the minimum regardless of mismatch conditions. The system cost is reduced since only one adaptive MPPT controller is required. Besides, the system efficiency is improved due to the true MPPT implementation and MPT control. Both simulation and experimental tests are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The fast detection of magnitude, frequency, and phase angle of the fundamental-frequency component is very useful in many three-phase power system applications. Most techniques to accomplish this task are based on different versions of three-phase phase-locked loop (PLL) schemes. Some variables of three-phase systems may experience phase angle jumps after some disturbances. In this paper, a method for the fast detection of phase angle jump occurrence, estimation of the phase angle jump, and its use for improving the performance of the generalized delayed signal cancelation (GDSC) PLL is proposed. The proposed method is based on the detailed evaluation of the GDSC filter transient behavior after a phase jump. Results considering typical three-phase grid disturbances are used to evaluate the proposed scheme, in comparison with other usual PLL techniques. The use of the proposed phase jump angle estimator allowed a reduction in the GDSC-PLL convergence time of about 50&#x0025;.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Time delay control (TDC) is a promising technique for robot manipulators because it is model-free, efficient, and yet, robust. Nevertheless, when a robot operates under significant payload changes, it is difficult to achieve satisfactory performance with a constant gain. To cope with this problem, several adaptive rules have already been proposed thus far, but they are less effective to significant payload changes, and parameter tuning procedures are too complicated. In this paper, we propose an adaptive gain dynamics that is more effective in payload changes and yet simpler to implement. Through simulations using a one-link arm and experiments using a whole arm manipulator with payload changes, the proposed dynamics was compared with the conventional TDC and two other existing methods. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can adapt to significant payload changes, achieving better accuracy than the conventional TDC. Experimental results show that the proposed method has consistently better adaptation capability than other methods, achieving significantly better accuracy. In addition, the proposed method is simpler to implement, having only one tuning parameter, whereas the existing methods require four or five such tuning parameters.
