<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The large randomised controlled trial on the effect of antibiotics to prevent infection after operative vaginal delivery by Marian Knight and colleagues1 in The Lancet is practice changing. Operative vaginal deliveries include either vacuum or forceps, and are used in about 2&#8211;15% of births.2 Even if one conservatively estimates 2% of babies are born by operative vaginal delivery globally, about 2&#8200;700&#8200;000 of the world's 135 million annual births are operative vaginal deliveries. Up to 16% of these births can be associated with infection without antibiotics prophylaxis,3 representing about 432&#8200;000 annual infections associated with operative vaginal delivery worldwide.

Its inclusive gender-based approach &#8220;was deemed politically unacceptable at the time, as most gender-based discussions in global health had hitherto focused on maternal health, in the context of sexual health and HIV&#8221;, she says.

<p>I have been working on issues of men, masculinities, and gender for 32 years, and it looks to me like men's roles in building gender equality are now part of the public agenda to an unprecedented extent. Almost every day, there are new stories and initiatives on how men can support women's participation in medicine and science, end domestic and sexual violence, share the load of fathering and housework, and more.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Sparse coding-based anomaly detection has shown promising performance, of which the keys are feature learning, sparse representation, and dictionary learning. In this paper, we propose a new neural network for anomaly detection (termed AnomalyNet) by deeply achieving feature learning, sparse representation, and dictionary learning in three joint neural processing blocks. Specifically, to learn better features, we design a motion fusion block accompanied by a feature transfer block to enjoy the advantages of eliminating noisy background, capturing motion, and alleviating data deficiency. Furthermore, to address some disadvantages (e.g., nonadaptive updating) of the existing sparse coding optimizers and embrace the merits of neural network (e.g., parallel computing), we design a novel recurrent neural network to learn sparse representation and dictionary by proposing an adaptive iterative hard-thresholding algorithm (adaptive ISTA) and reformulating the adaptive ISTA as a new long short-term memory (LSTM). To the best of our knowledge, this could be one of the first works to bridge the  $ell _{1}$ -solver and LSTM and may provide novel insight into understanding LSTM and model-based optimization (or named differentiable programming), as well as sparse coding-based anomaly detection. Extensive experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of our method in the abnormal events detection task.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Gait is a useful biometric feature for human identification in video surveillance applications since it can be obtained without subject cooperation. In recent years, model-based gait recognition using a 3D skeleton has been widely studied through view-invariant modeling and kinematic gait analysis. However, existing methods integrate all frame-level feature vectors using the same criterion, even though skeleton information is highly sensitive to changes in covariate conditions such as clothing, carrying, and occlusion. The scheme inevitably reduces the frame-level discriminative power and eventually degrades performance. Instead, we propose a robust frame-level matching method for gait recognition that minimizes the influence of noisy patterns as well as secures the frame-level discriminative power. To this end, we measure the skeleton quality in terms of body symmetry for each frame. Based on the quality, we construct a quality-adjusted cost matrix between input frames and registered frames to prevent matching with noisy patterns. Our two-stage linear matching is then applied to the cost matrix to compute a frame-level discriminative score including similarity and margin. In the end, the identity of a probe is determined by a weighted majority voting scheme via frame-level scores. It enhances the robustness against inaccurate skeleton estimation results by assigning different weights for each frame based on the score. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets (UPCVgait, UPCVgaitK2, and SDUgait) and a new gait dataset which we create with consideration of unpredictable behaviors while walking. In addition, we demonstrate that our method is robust to skeleton estimation error, partial occlusion, and data loss. The CILgait dataset and MATLAB code are available at https://sites.google.com/site/seokeonchoi/gait-recognition.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a frequency diverse array-based directional modulation with artificial noise synthesis scheme is proposed to enhance the physical layer security of wireless communications. We aim to optimize the secrecy performance by jointly optimizing the frequency offsets, the beamforming vector, and the artificial-noise projection matrix (ANPM). Specifically, we address the physical layer security problems for known locations of proximal eavesdropper (Eve) and legitimate user (LU). The beamforming vector and frequency offsets are designed to preserve the signal power at LU. The ANPM is calculated to minimize the effect of AN on LU. Furthermore, we extend our approach to the case of multi-LUs with unknown Eve locations. Being different from the case of a single LU, the frequency offsets across array antennas are optimized to equally allocate transmitted power to each LU. The numerical results show that the proposed method can provide a higher secrecy performance than conventional DM methods. In the case of multi-LUs with unknown Eve locations, the proposed method can provide a high secrecy capacity while achieving almost equal achievable capacity to each LU.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Real-world applications of record linkage often require matching to be robust in spite of small variations in string fields. For example, two health care providers should be able to detect a patient in common, even if one record contains a typo or transcription error. In the privacy-preserving setting, however, the problem of approximate string matching has been cast as a trade-off between security and practicality, and the literature has mainly focused on Bloom filter encodings, an approach which can leak significant information about the underlying records. We present a novel public-key construction for secure two-party evaluation of threshold functions in restricted domains based on embeddings found in the message spaces of additively homomorphic encryption schemes. We use this to construct an efficient two-party protocol for privately computing the threshold Dice coefficient. Relative to the approach of Bloom filter encodings, our proposal offers formal security guarantees and greater matching accuracy. We implement the protocol and demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in linking medium-sized patient databases with tens of thousands of records.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper considers physical layer security enhancement mechanisms that utilize simultaneous beamforming and jamming in visible light communication systems with a randomly located eavesdropper under the assumption that there are multiple light-emitting diode (LED) transmitters and one intended user. When an eavesdropper with an augmented front-end receiver is present, the jamming is very useful for preventing the eavesdropper from wiretapping the information since it is not possible to extract only the information component from the received signal if the jamming signal is random. Thus, in this paper, an optimization problem is formulated with a focus on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio for the legitimate link, and it is solved by a heuristic method called the concave&#x2013;convex procedure. Then, a ternary scheme is proposed, which is less complicated than the full (joint) scheme, and it is optimized by adopting a formulation based on an assignment problem, the solution of which is effectively obtained by the so-called tabu search procedure. In addition, the problem of maximizing the average secrecy rate is investigated by utilizing a continuous LED model, which significantly relaxes the complication that rises from calculating the expectation with respect to the location of the eavesdropper. Our analysis and simulation results show that the proposed simultaneous beamforming and jamming strategies (both joint and ternary) are good proxies for maximizing the average secrecy rate by utilizing the statistical information on the eavesdropper&#x2019;s random location.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deblurring is a fundamental inverse problem in bioimaging. It requires modeling the point spread function (PSF), which captures the optical distortions entailed by the image formation process. The PSF limits the spatial resolution attainable for a given microscope. However, recent applications require a higher resolution and have prompted the development of super-resolution techniques to achieve sub-pixel accuracy. This requirement restricts the class of suitable PSF models to analog ones. In addition, deblurring is computationally intensive, hence further requiring computationally efficient models. A custom candidate fitting both the requirements is the Gaussian model. However, this model cannot capture the rich tail structures found in both the theoretical and empirical PSFs. In this paper, we aim at improving the reconstruction accuracy beyond the Gaussian model, while preserving its computational efficiency. We introduce a new class of analog PSF models based on the Gaussian mixtures. The number of Gaussian kernels controls both the modeling accuracy and the computational efficiency of the model: the lower the number of kernels, the lower the accuracy and the higher the efficiency. To explore the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, we propose a variational formulation of the PSF calibration problem, where a convex sparsity-inducing penalty on the number of Gaussian kernels allows trading accuracy for efficiency. We derive an efficient algorithm based on a fully split formulation of alternating split Bregman. We assess our framework on synthetic and real data, and demonstrate a better reconstruction accuracy in both geometry and photometry in point source localization&#x2014;a fundamental inverse problem in fluorescence microscopy.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recognizing a camera wearer&#x2019;s actions from videos captured by an egocentric camera is a challenging task. In this paper, we employ a two-stream deep neural network composed of an appearance-based stream and a motion-based stream to recognize egocentric actions. Based on the insight that human action and gaze behavior are highly coordinated in object manipulation tasks, we propose a spatial attention network to predict human gaze in the form of attention map. The attention map helps each of the two streams to focus on the most relevant spatial region of the video frames to predict actions. To better model the temporal structure of the videos, a temporal network is proposed. The temporal network incorporates bi-directional long short-term memory to model the long-range dependencies to recognize egocentric actions. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is able to predict attention maps that are consistent with human attention and achieve competitive action recognition performance with the state-of-the-art methods on the GTEA Gaze and GTEA Gaze&#x002b; datasets.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a new algorithm for automatic estimation of muscle fiber orientation (MFO) in musculoskeletal ultrasound images, which is commonly used for both diagnosis and rehabilitation assessment of patients. The algorithm is based on a novel adaptive fading Bayesian Kalman filter (AF-BKF) and an automatic region of interest (ROI) extraction method. The ROI is first enhanced by the Gabor filter (GF) and extracted automatically using the revoting constrained Radon transform (RCRT) approach. The dominant MFO in the ROI is then detected by the RT and tracked by the proposed AF-BKF, which employs simplified Gaussian mixtures to approximate the non-Gaussian state densities and a new adaptive fading method to update the mixture parameters. An AF-BK smoother (AF-BKS) is also proposed by extending the AF-BKF using the concept of Rauch&#x2013;Tung&#x2013;Striebel smoother for further smoothing the fascicle orientations. The experimental results and comparisons show that: 1) the maximum segmentation error of the proposed RCRT is below nine pixels, which is sufficiently small for MFO tracking; 2) the accuracy of MFO gauged by RT in the ROI enhanced by the GF is comparable to that of using multiscale vessel enhancement filter-based method and better than those of local RT and revoting Hough transform approaches; and 3) the proposed AF-BKS algorithm outperforms the other tested approaches and achieves a performance close to those obtained by experienced operators (the overall covariance obtained by the AF-BKS is 3.19, which is rather close to that of the operators, 2.86). It, thus, serves as a valuable tool for automatic estimation of fascicle orientations and possibly for other applications in musculoskeletal ultrasound images.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The tracking-by-detection framework receives growing attention through the integration with the convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Existing tracking-by-detection-based methods, however, fail to track objects with severe appearance variations. This is because the traditional convolutional operation is performed on fixed grids, and thus may not be able to find the correct response while the object is changing pose or under varying environmental conditions. In this paper, we propose a deformable convolution layer to enrich the target appearance representations in the tracking-by-detection framework. We aim to capture the target appearance variations via deformable convolution, which adaptively enhances its original features. In addition, we also propose a gated fusion scheme to control how the variations captured by the deformable convolution affect the original appearance. The enriched feature representation through deformable convolution facilitates the discrimination of the CNN classifier on the target object and background. The extensive experiments on the standard benchmarks show that the proposed tracker performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Multi-turn video question answering is a challenging task in visual information retrieval, which generates the accurate answer from the referenced video contents according to the visual conversation context and given question. However, the existing visual question answering methods mainly tackle the problem of single-turn video question answering, which may be ineffectively applied for multi-turn video question answering directly, due to the insufficiency of modeling the sequential conversation context. In this paper, we study the problem of multi-turn video question answering from the viewpoint of multi-stream hierarchical attention context reinforced network learning. We first propose the hierarchical attention context network for context-aware question understanding by modeling the hierarchically sequential conversation context structure. We then develop the multi-stream spatio-temporal attention network for learning the joint representation of the dynamic video contents and context-aware question embedding. We next devise a multi-step reasoning process to enhance the multi-stream hierarchical attention context network learning method. We finally predict the multiple-choice answer from the candidate answer set and further develop the reinforced decoder network to generate the open-ended natural language answer for multi-turn video question answering. We construct two large-scale multi-turn video question answering datasets. The extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method.

<p>Automated production systems are critical enablers for Industry 4.0 because these design-to-order, custom-built mechatronic systems are not only capable of delivering automation capabilities to satisfy the stakeholder requirements in the manufacturing/production domain, but doing so for a long period of time (e.g., several decades) during which numerous changing needs shall also be accounted for. Although traceability has long been recognized as key to sustain changes, little is known about how the traceability information is managed in place, i.e., in the native environments where the engineering artifacts reside. We contribute in this paper a survey of traceability support within state-of-the-practice tools: seven for programming logic controllers and six for building models in systems modeling language. We draw the similarities and differences from our survey results, and further present a design by leveraging the in-place traceability to better support the development and evolution of automated production systems.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a variable structure speed controller (VSSC) that guarantees the robust transient performance against the external disturbances and parameter uncertainties of an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive. Unlike the conventional VSSC applied to the IPMSMs, the proposed nonlinear compensating control term not only assures the robustness against the system uncertainties, but also implements the maximum torque per ampere technique. Furthermore, the convergence and stability of the proposed VSSC are fully proven through the Lyapunov theory by introducing reasonable bounded uncertainties which determine a feasible range for the system dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is investigated through the simulation using MATLAB/Simulink and experiment using a prototype IPMSM drive system with a TI TMS320F28335 DSP. Finally, the proposed VSSC can ensure faster and more robust transient response than the conventional proportional-integral speed controller under the dynamic load conditions including the uncertainties.

<p>Efficient deadlock control policies are very important in the operation of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS). This paper focuses on deadlock control problems for a general class of FMS. They have three interesting characteristics from the application point of view. First, flexible routes of parts and assembly operations are allowed. Second, the number of parts of the same type in a product may be more than one. Third, an operation may require multiple resources. To characterize such FMS, a Petri net model that can deal well with all FMS characteristics is developed. Based on it, this paper proposes a Banker&#x0027;s-algorithm-like deadlock avoidance policy. The proposed policy is proved to be polynomial in the model size. Moreover, experimental results indicate its effectiveness and superiority over the state-of-the-art policies.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper introduces a novel optimum design of the proportional&#x2013;integral (PI) controller in the power converter circuits using the water cycle algorithm (WCA) to augment the transient stability of a grid-connected wave energy conversion (WEC) system. The proposed system relies on the Archimedes wave swing device, which is coupled with a linear permanent magnet synchronous generator (LPMSG). The WEC system is interfaced with the power grid via a generator-side converter (GSC) and a grid-side inverter (GSI). The GSC is used to control both of the d-axis and q-axis current of the LPMSG to minimize its power losses and extract its maximum real power, respectively. The GSI is implemented to control the terminal voltage at the point of common coupling and the dc-link voltage through a complete vector control scheme. The proposed optimal WCA-based PI control strategy is applied to both converters. The optimization process depends on the simulation-based optimization approach. In the proposed approach, the criterion of integral squared error is chosen as a multiobjective function. To validate the proposed WEC system model, the simulation results are compared with the practical results, and their error reaches less than 1&#x0025;. The effectiveness of the proposed WCA-based PI control strategy is tested and compared with that obtained using the genetic-algorithm-based PI control scheme under symmetrical and unsymmetrical grid fault conditions taking into account a successful and unsuccessful reclosure of circuit breakers. The validity of the proposed control strategy is extensively checked based on simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In recent years, great success has been achieved in visual object detection, which is one of the fundamental tasks in the field of industrial intelligence. Most of existing methods have been proposed to deal with single well-captured still images, while in practical robotic applications, due to nuisances, such as tiny scale, partial view, or occlusion, one still image may not contain enough information for object detection. However, an intelligent robot has the capability to adjust its viewpoint to get better images for detection. Therefore, active object detection becomes a very important perception strategy for intelligent robots. In this paper, by formulating active object detection as a sequential action decision process, a deep reinforcement learning framework is established to resolve it. Furthermore, a novel deep Q-learning network (DQN) with a dueling architecture is proposed, the network has two separate output channels, one predicts action type and the other predicts action range. By combining the two output channels, the action space is explored more efficiently. Several methods are extensively validated and the results show that the proposed one obtains the best results and predicts action in real time.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a distributed cooperative control scheme, considering the state-of-charge balance and power limits of battery-storage units (BSUs) in the consensus protocol, is proposed to achieve the average bus voltage consensus in a dc microgrid with photovoltaics. The state variable defined in the consensus protocol enables all BSUs to charge or discharge together without introducing circulating currents among BSUs. Furthermore, by incorporating power limits of BSUs in the defined state variable, power violation of the BSUs can be prevented. The consensus-based distributed control only utilizes neighbor-to-neighbor communication to realize the global consensus, and, thus, avoids the single point of the failure compared to the conventional centralized control. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in an islanded dc microgrid under different testing scenarios.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Converter-driven direct current (dc) motors exhibit various advantages in industry, but impose several challenges to higher precision speed regulation in the presence of parametric uncertainties and exogenous, time-varying load torque disturbances. In this paper, the robust predictive speed regulation problem of a generic dc&#x2013;dc buck converter-driven permanent magnet dc motors is addressed by using an output feedback discrete-time model predictive control algorithm. A new discrete-time reduced-order generalized proportional-integral observer (GPIO) is proposed to reconstruct the virtual system states as well as the lumped disturbances. The estimates of GPIO are then collected for output speed prediction. An optimized duty ratio law of the converter is obtained by solving a constrained receding horizon optimization problem, where the operational constraint on control input is explicitly taken into account. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed new algorithm is demonstrated by various experimental testing results.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the automated demand response (DR) problem in smart grids equipped with information and communication technology networks, where power generating and consuming units can exchange information as a multiagent system (MAS), and a real-time pricing (RTP) scheme is proposed. When the communication graph among agents is connected, a novel parallel and distributed consensus-based algorithm is proposed to derive an RTP scheme to facilitate DR, and when communication uncertainties exist, a robust consensus algorithm is proposed to cease the effect of uncertainties. Next, this paper proposes a novel control mechanism to tackle the problem of disconnected communication among agents, e.g., under cyber-attacks, by employing the so-called mixed communication-broadcast control architecture where the underlying ideas are twofold. First, each area in the grid associated with a connected subgraph is controlled by a MAS to guarantee the power balance and to reach consensus on the local electric price for that area. Second, a supervisory unit observes those local electric prices to calculate the global electric price for the whole grid and then broadcasts to all units so that they can properly adjust their output powers. Simulations are carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system to validate the proposed control mechanisms.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>High control bandwidth is usually restricted in a finite sampling rate of a charge-coupled device (CCD)-based tracking loop, which hinders a good closed-loop performance. Conventionally, a rate feedforward controller is usually used to improve the control performance; however, it is restricted by the line-of-sight (LOS) rate, which is required to be estimated due to only the LOS error available in the CCD-based tracking control system. Besides that, it is also affected by the inverse of the control model. A new error-based feedforward (EBF) control mode is proposed to overcome these difficulties. Due to being plugged into an existing feedback control loop, the closed-loop performance of the CCD-based control system can be minimized by optimizing a Q-filter. The closed-loop stability and robustness with this EBF control system are investigated on the condition of the gain margin and the phase margin of the open-loop transfer function. Furthermore, this paper proposes a new criterion to enhance the robustness of the EBF control system and reveals the sensitivity function property. Because of not being restricted by an accurate model, this new feedforward controller cannot lead to a compromise between error attenuation and noise propagation in the control loop. Simulations and experiments are both used to testify the effectiveness of the improved control mode.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper describes an augmented reality (AR)-aided smart sensing technique for in-line condition monitoring of insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) wafers. A series of signal processing algorithms are applied for enabling sensor intelligence. Based on electromagnetic infrared&#x2013;visible fusion (IVF), a supplementary palpable three-dimensional thermography layer is integrated with an IGBT wafer in real world environment. Before the IVF, independent component analysis is implemented to identify defects in the wafer. The proposed AR-aided smart sensing technique enhances user&#x0027;s perception and interaction between the industrial systems and the surrounding world. In contrast to conventional sensor techniques, it provides nondestructive testing and evaluation based high-throughput in-line condition monitoring method. The advantages of noncontact and time efficient of this smart sensing technique potentially bring huge benefit to yield management and production efficiency. AR-aided smart sensing can improve the productivity, quality, and reliability of power electronic materials and devices, as well as in other industrial applications.
