<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A consortium of research funders, Coalition S, has published its revised recommendations for accelerating the transition to open access for scientific publications. The fundamental principles of Plan S remain intact. No scholarly publication should be locked behind a paywall. Open access should be immediate, without embargoes. The preferred Creative Commons licence is CC BY. Funders will support open access fees at reasonable levels. Funders will not pay for publication in hybrid journals, unless they are part of transformative arrangements with clearly defined open access endpoints.

<p>Italy has been witnessing a rapid escalation towards racism and xenophobia since the new government came into power in June, 2018. On Nov 27, 2018, the lower house of the Italian Parliament approved the Decree-Law on Immigration and Security, which includes measures that would abolish humanitarian protection status for migrants, block asylum seekers from accessing reception centres focusing on social inclusion, and extend the duration of detention in return centres and hotspots. These measures fundamentally undermine international human rights principles.

<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterised by the loss of self-tolerance and formation of nuclear autoantigens and immune complexes resulting in inflammation of multiple organs. The clinical presentation of SLE is heterogeneous, can involve one or more organs, including the skin, kidneys, joints, and nervous system, and take a chronic or relapsing and remitting disease course. SLE is most common in women and in those of non-white ethnicity. Because of the multitude of presentations, manifestations, and serological abnormalities in patients with SLE, diagnosis can be challenging.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Electric network frequency (ENF) is a time-varying signal of the frequency of mains electricity in a power grid. It continuously fluctuates around a nominal value (50/60 Hz) due to changes in the supply and demand of power over time. Depending on these ENF variations, the luminous intensity of a mains-powered light source also fluctuates. These fluctuations in luminance can be captured by video recordings. Accordingly, the ENF can be estimated from such videos by the analysis of steady content in the video scene. When videos are captured by using a rolling shutter sampling mechanism, as is done mostly with CMOS cameras, there is an idle period between successive frames. Consequently, a number of illumination samples of the scene are effectively lost due to the idle period. These missing samples affect the ENF estimation, in the sense of the frequency shift caused and the power attenuation that results. This paper develops an analytical model for videos captured using a rolling shutter mechanism. This model illustrates how the frequency of the main ENF harmonic varies depending on the idle period length, and how the power of the captured ENF attenuates as idle period increases. Based on this, a novel idle period estimation method for potential use in camera forensics that is able to operate independently of video frame rate is proposed. Finally, a novel time-of-recording verification approach based on the use of multiple ENF components, idle period assumptions, and the interpolation of missing ENF samples is also proposed.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We introduce the multiple enrollment scheme for SRAM-physical unclonable functions (PUFs). During each enrollment, the binary power-on values of the SRAM are observed, and a corresponding key and helper data are generated. Each key can later be reconstructed from an additional observation and the helper data. The helper data do not reveal information about the keys to an attacker. It is our goal to use the additional enrollments to consecutively increase the entropy of the generated key material. We analyze two alternative settings. First, we present a regular setting, where each additional key is independent of all previous keys. Second, we introduce a key-replacement setting, where instead of an additional independent key, a new key (of increased length) is generated that replaces the old key. We characterize the capacity regions for both the settings. We show that the total achievable secret-key rate is equal to the mutual information between all enrollment observations and a single (reconstruction) observation. We derive our results based on a statistical model for the SRAM-PUF that has been proposed in the literature. This model implies a permutation symmetry property of the SRAM-PUF which plays a key role in our proofs.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>By learning generative models of semantic-rich data distributions from samples, generative adversarial network (GAN) has recently attracted intensive research interests due to its excellent empirical performance as a generative model. The model is used to estimate the underlying distribution of a dataset and randomly generate realistic samples according to their estimated distribution. However, GANs can easily remember training samples due to the high model complexity of deep networks. When GANs are applied to private or sensitive data, the concentration of distribution may divulge some critical information. It consequently requires new technological advances to mitigate the information leakage under GANs. To address this issue, we propose GANobfuscator, a differentially private GAN, which can achieve differential privacy under GANs by adding carefully designed noise to gradients during the learning procedure. With GANobfuscator, analysts are able to generate an unlimited amount of synthetic data for arbitrary analysis tasks without disclosing the privacy of training data. Moreover, we theoretically prove that GANobfuscator can provide strict privacy guarantee with differential privacy. In addition, we develop a gradient-pruning strategy for GANobfuscator to improve the scalability and stability of data training. Through extensive experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that GANobfuscator can produce high-quality generated data and retain desirable utility under practical privacy budgets.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A remarkable characteristic of the modern operating system is open, which means that we can download data or execute codes from any Internet sources whether they are trusted or not. Therefore, there is a contradict situation when we want to use these data or codes as well as keep the system secured. Despite decades of studies and experiences on this problem, it is still assumed as a great challenge. This paper presents a novel dynamic defense model (DDM) to reduce security risks brought by these suspicious data or codes for the open operating systems. DDM is a high-level security defense abstraction with four key components: dynamic label marking, dynamic label tracking, dynamic label modulating, and run-time controlling. With these components, DDM achieves the full, dynamic, and real-time security protection in the whole life cycle of the operating system. We also practically implemented a prototype system named DDDroid on Android. We constructed a mixed experimental dataset with 30 malware samples and 970 benign applications to test the defense effects of DDDroid. DDDroid detects 97&#x0025; of the malware samples that have malicious actions and blocks these actions with a negligible false positive on legal actions. We also demonstrated that DDDroid is an effective system, which prevents sensitive data from being leaked by suspicious applications deliberately or by users unintentionally through some sample experiments. What is more, with extensive evaluations, DDDroid is proved to be a system with low-performance overhead and limited memory consumption.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Audio editing software can easily be used to manipulate digital speech for forgery. Smoothing on the tampered boundary is usually performed to eliminate the obvious traces of forgery after tampering. This presents a considerable challenge for the forensic detection of tampered speech because the smoothing model is unknown and the smoothing operation often modifies only several tens of samples with the editing software. In this paper, we propose to apply six filtering models to approximate the smoothing in audio editing software for training the classifier. We analyze the impact of filtering operations on speech signals, especially on differential signals. On the basis of the local variance of the differential signal, we design a simple and yet efficient feature set. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments show that the proposed features are very effective in detecting several common filtering operations on very short speech clips. The experimental results also show that the proposed method can detect unknown smoothing performed by commonly used audio editing software, such as Cooledit and Adobe Audition. This highlights the promising potential of the proposed method for use as a forgery localization tool of digital speech signals in practical forensic applications. The proposed method is capable of detecting smoothing on very short speech clips containing only several tens of samples and practical forgery used in audio editing software.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The single-phase split-source inverter (SSI) is an emerging and attractive topology for a boost dc&#x2013;ac power conversion system. Such as an inverter features high compactness, although at the expense of high-frequency commutations across the diodes. The corresponding hybrid pulsewidth modulation (PWM) also confines the voltage harmonics to concentrate around the switching frequency and its multiples. This paper proposes a simplified SSI, which is realized by inserting only one power switch into an H-bridge. While generating the ac output, the newly developed PWM strategy ensures the inductor charged with constant duty cycle. When compared to the existing SSIs, it offers the added benefits of reduced switch count, enhanced voltage-boosting gain, reduced output filter requirement, and enhanced power efficiency. Comprehensive steady-state analysis is discussed while simulation and experimental results are subsequently presented to prove the validity of the proposed topology and the PWM strategy.

<p>To realize an efficient translation in a narrow space, a surface milli-walker based on linear piezoelectric actuation is proposed, fabricated, and tested in this paper. Operating at the second-order out-of-plane flexural vibration mode, the proposed surface walker is able to realize a linear movement on demand. The surface walker has a weight of 0.135 g with package size of 6 &#x00d7; 2 &#x00d7; 2&#x00a0;mm.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a two-period frame transient switching control scheme for buck converters using coupled-inductor auxiliary circuit to improve the load dynamic response is proposed. The proposed auxiliary circuit only works during a transient event, while in steady state only the main converter side of the coupled inductor is used with a constant-frequency capacitor-current hysteresis control (CF-CCHC) scheme. The transient event consists of two periods, in the first of which, the coupled inductor is inversely connected in parallel using a logic switching control scheme, so as to reduce the equivalent inductance sharply and achieve a small voltage-deviation transient regulation. In the second transient period, the auxiliary-circuit side inductor works in a freewheeling state and the converter behaves as in an approximate steady state using the CCHC scheme. With three switching actions of the auxiliary circuit, the proposed scheme is implemented using a digital processor and an analog control circuit. With the application of the proposed control scheme to a 24&#x2013;12 V synchronous buck converter, its feasibility is validated in simulation and experiment. Experimental results demonstrate that the settling time of the proposed scheme, with its coupled coefficient of 0.57, has improved by more than 83&#x0025; compared to the time-optimal control scheme, and the voltage deviation has improved by more than 77&#x0025; as well.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The surface normal estimation from photometric stereo becomes less reliable when the surface reflectance deviates from the Lambertian assumption. The non-Lambertian effect can be explicitly addressed by physics modeling to the reflectance function, at the cost of introducing highly nonlinear optimization. This paper proposes a numerical compensation scheme that attempts to minimize the angular error to address the non-Lambertian photometric stereo problem. Due to the multifaceted influence in the modeling of non-Lambertian reflectance in photometric stereo, directly minimizing the angular errors of surface normal is a highly complex problem. We introduce an alternating strategy, in which the estimated reflectance can be temporarily regarded as a known variable, to simplify the formulation of angular error. To reduce the impact of inaccurately estimated reflectance in this simplification, we propose a numerical compensation scheme whose compensation weight is formulated to reflect the reliability of estimated reflectance. Finally, the solution for the proposed numerical compensation scheme is efficiently computed by using cosine difference to approximate the angular difference. The experimental results show that our method can significantly improve the performance of the state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic data and real data with small additive costs. Moreover, our method initialized by results from the baseline method (least-square-based) achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic data and real data with significantly smaller overall computation, i.e., about eight times faster compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Signal decomposition is a classical problem in signal processing, which aims to separate an observed signal into two or more components, each with its own property. Usually, each component is described by its own subspace or dictionary. Extensive research has been done for the case where the components are additive, but in real-world applications, the components are often non-additive. For example, an image may consist of a foreground object overlaid on a background, where each pixel either belongs to the foreground or the background. In such a situation, to separate signal components, we need to find a binary mask which shows the location of each component. Therefore, it requires solving a binary optimization problem. Since most of the binary optimization problems are intractable, we relax this problem to the approximated continuous problem and solve it by alternating optimization technique. We show the application of the proposed algorithm for three applications: separation of text from a background in images, separation of moving objects from a background undergoing global camera motion in videos, and separation of sinusoidal and spike components in 1-D signals. We demonstrate in each case that considering the non-additive nature of the problem can lead to a significant improvement.

Our scheme relies upon constructing at a single base view, a disparity model for a group of views, and then utilizing this base-anchored model to infer disparity at all views belonging to the group. We employ a hierarchical disparity-compensated inter-view transform where the corresponding analysis and synthesis filters are applied along the geometric flows defined by the base-anchored disparity model. The output of this inter-view transform along with the disparity information is subjected to spatial wavelet transforms and embedded block-based coding. Rate-distortion results reveal superior performance to the x.265 anchor chosen by the JPEG Pleno standards activity for the coding of multiview imagery captured by high-density camera arrays.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With a good balance between tracking accuracy and speed, correlation filter (CF) has become one of the best object tracking frameworks, based on which many successful trackers have been developed. Recently, spatially regularized CF tracking (SRDCF) has been developed to remedy the annoying boundary effects of CF tracking, thus further boosting the tracking performance. However, SRDCF uses a fixed spatial regularization map constructed from a loose bounding box and its performance inevitably degrades when the target or background show significant variations, such as object deformation or occlusion. To address this problem, we propose a new dynamic saliency-aware regularized CF tracking (DSAR-CF) scheme. In DSAR-CF, a simple yet effective energy function, which reflects the object saliency and tracking reliability in the spatial-temporal domain, is defined to guide the online updating of the regularization weight map using an efficient level-set algorithm. Extensive experiments validate that the proposed DSAR-CF leads to better performance in terms of accuracy and speed than the original SRDCF.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With advanced image journaling tools, one can easily alter the semantic meaning of an image by exploiting certain manipulation techniques such as copy clone, object splicing, and removal, which mislead the viewers. In contrast, the identification of these manipulations becomes a very challenging task as manipulated regions are not visually apparent. This paper proposes a high-confidence manipulation localization architecture that utilizes resampling features, long short-term memory (LSTM) cells, and an encoder-decoder network to segment out manipulated regions from non-manipulated ones. Resampling features are used to capture artifacts, such as JPEG quality loss, upsampling, downsampling, rotation, and shearing. The proposed network exploits larger receptive fields (spatial maps) and frequency-domain correlation to analyze the discriminative characteristics between the manipulated and non-manipulated regions by incorporating the encoder and LSTM network. Finally, the decoder network learns the mapping from low-resolution feature maps to pixel-wise predictions for image tamper localization. With the predicted mask provided by the final layer (softmax) of the proposed architecture, end-to-end training is performed to learn the network parameters through back-propagation using the ground-truth masks. Furthermore, a large image splicing dataset is introduced to guide the training process. The proposed method is capable of localizing image manipulations at the pixel level with high precision, which is demonstrated through rigorous experimentation on three diverse datasets.

<p>Automated fault detection is an important part of a quality control system. It has the potential to increase the overall quality of monitored products and processes. The fault detection of automotive instrument cluster systems in computer-based manufacturing assembly lines is currently limited to simple boundary checking. The analysis of more complex nonlinear signals is performed manually by trained operators, whose knowledge is used to supervise quality checking and manual detection of faults. We present a novel approach for automated Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) based on deep learning. The approach was tested on data generated by computer-based manufacturing systems equipped with local and remote sensing devices. The results show that the approach models the different spatial/temporal patterns found in the data. The approach can successfully diagnose and locate multiple classes of faults under real-time working conditions. The proposed method is shown to outperform other established FDI methods.

<p>The foods we eat can play an important role in preventing cancer. New modeling research presented at Nutrition 2019 shows that policies using taxes or warning labels to encourage healthier eating could reduce the number of people who develop cancer, which would bring significant savings in medical costs.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A novel method for the estimation of the temperature distribution in a rapid thermal processing (RTP) system is developed in this paper. The proposed method uses a proper orthogonal decomposition algorithm to extract the dominant modes of the temperature distribution and a reduced-order model is obtained. Then, a reduced-order sliding-mode observer is developed to capture the dynamics of the dominant modes. The estimated dynamics of the dominant modes can be used to reconstruct the temperature distribution. It is proved that the estimation error would be drawn into a small boundary rapidly. Test results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed observer for the RTP system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a new channel model is presented for molecular communications (MC), where a point source emitted by the transmitter undergoes three phases, with effect of convection dominating in the first two phases, whereas diffusion prevailing in the final phase. The point source obtains its initial velocity and passes through the nozzle of the nanomachine transmitter in the first phase, followed by a deceleration process in the second phase. The free diffusion model is considered in the third phase. Based on this channel model, the energy transfer issue for two-way MC system is also taken into account, in which one of the transceivers is assumed to have abundant information molecules from its ambient environment, whereas the other one obtains the information molecules by implementing the simultaneous molecular information and energy transfer (SMIET). Finally, analytical bit error rate (BER) expressions are validated by computer simulations. Our results suggest that the symbol duration and the SMIET order significantly influence the BER performance in our two-way MC system.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In the last few years, there has been an exponential increase in the deployment of 5G-based test beds across the globe with an aim to reduce the latency for accessing various applications. The integration of generic services such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine-type communications (mMTC), critical machine-type communication (cMTC), and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) can improve the performance of 5G-based applications. This service heterogeneity can be achieved by network slicing for an optimized resource allocation and an emerging technology, Tactile Internet, to achieve low latency, high bandwidth, service availability, and end-to-end security. In this paper, we discuss the application-specific nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based communication architecture for Tactile Internet which allows nonorthogonal resource sharing from a pool of eMBB, mMTC, cMTC, and URLLC devices to a shared base station. We summarize various variants of NOMA and their suitability for future low latency Tactile-Internet-based applications.
