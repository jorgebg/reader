<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A blockchain is redactable if a private key holder (e.g. a central authority)
can change any single block without violating integrity of the whole
blockchain, but no other party can do that. In this paper, we offer a simple
method of constructing redactable blockchains inspired by the ideas underlying
the well-known RSA encryption scheme. Notably, our method can be used in
conjunction with any reasonable hash function that is used to build a
blockchain. Public immutability of a blockchain in our construction is based on
the computational hardness of the RSA problem and not on properties of the
underlying hash function. Corruption resistance is based on the computational
hardness of the discrete logarithm problem.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The paper explores a novel methodology in source code obfuscation through the
application of text-based recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder-decoder models
in ciphertext generation and key generation. Sequence-to-sequence models are
incorporated into the model architecture to generate obfuscated code, generate
the deobfuscation key, and live execution. Quantitative benchmark comparison to
existing obfuscation methods indicate significant improvement in stealth and
execution cost for the proposed solution, and experiments regarding the model's
properties yield positive results regarding its character variation,
dissimilarity to the original codebase, and consistent length of obfuscated
code.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Traditional public distributed ledgers have not been able to scale-out well
and work efficiently. Sharding is deemed as a promising way to solve this
problem. By partitioning all nodes into small committees and letting them work
in parallel, we can significantly lower the amount of communication and
computation, reduce the overhead on each node's storage, as well as enhance the
throughput of distributed ledger. Existing sharding-based protocols still
suffer from several serious drawbacks. The first thing is that all honest nodes
must connect well with each other, which demands a huge number of communication
channels in the network. Moreover, previous protocols have face great loss in
efficiency in the case where the honesty of each committee's leader is in
question. At the same time, no explicit incentive is provided for nodes to
actively participate in the protocol.
</p>
<p>We present CycLedger, a scalable and secure parallel protocol for distributed
ledger via sharding. Our protocol selects a leader and a partial set for each
committee, who are in charge of maintaining intra-shard consensus and
communicating with other committees, to reduce the amortized complexity of
communication, computation and storage on all nodes. We introduce a novel
commitment scheme between committees and a recovery procedure to prevent the
system from crashing even when leaders of committees are malicious. To add
incentive for the network, we use the concept of reputation, which measures
each node's computing power. As nodes with higher reputation receive more
rewards, there is an encouragement for nodes with strong computing ability to
work honestly so as to gain reputation. In this way, we strike out a new path
to establish scalability, security and incentive for the sharding-based
distributed ledger.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A new cybersecurity attack,where an adversary illicitly runs crypto-mining
software over the devices of unaware users, is emerging in both the literature
and in the wild . This attack, known as cryptojacking, has proved to be very
effective given the simplicity of running a crypto-client into a target device.
Several countermeasures have recently been proposed, with different features
and performance, but all characterized by a host-based architecture. This kind
of solutions, designed to protect the individual user, are not suitable for
efficiently protecting a corporate network, especially against insiders. In
this paper, we propose a network-based approach to detect and identify
crypto-clients activities by solely relying on the network traffic, even when
encrypted. First, we provide a detailed analysis of the real network traces
generated by three major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Monero, and Bytecoin,
considering both the normal traffic and the one shaped by a VPN. Then, we
propose Crypto-Aegis, a Machine Learning (ML) based framework built over the
results of our investigation, aimed at detecting cryptocurrencies related
activities, e.g., pool mining, solo mining, and active full nodes. Our solution
achieves a striking 0.96 of F1-score and 0.99 of AUC for the ROC, while
enjoying a few other properties, such as device and infrastructure
independence. Given the extent and novelty of the addressed threat we believe
that our approach, supported by its excellent results, pave the way for further
research in this area.

<p>Short-range audio channels have a few distinguishing characteristics: ease of
use, low deployment costs, and easy to tune frequencies, to cite a few.
Moreover, thanks to their seamless adaptability to the security context, many
techniques and tools based on audio signals have been recently proposed.
However, while the most promising solutions are turning into valuable
commercial products, acoustic channels are increasingly used also to launch
attacks against systems and devices, leading to security concerns that could
thwart their adoption. To provide a rigorous, scientific, security-oriented
review of the field, in this paper we survey and classify methods,
applications, and use-cases rooted on short-range audio channels for the
provisioning of security services---including Two-Factor Authentication
techniques, pairing solutions, device authorization strategies, defense
methodologies, and attack schemes. Moreover, we also point out the strengths
and weaknesses deriving from the use of short-range audio channels. Finally, we
provide open research issues in the context of short-range audio channels
security, calling for contributions from both academia and industry.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Image restoration (IR) is a long-standing challenging problem in low-level image processing. It is of utmost importance to learn good image priors for pursuing visually pleasing results. In this paper, we develop a multi-channel and multi-model-based denoising autoencoder network as image prior for solving IR problem. Specifically, the network that trained on RGB-channel images is used to construct a prior at first, and then the learned prior is incorporated into single-channel grayscale IR tasks. To achieve the goal, we employ the auxiliary variable technique to integrate the higher-dimensional network-driven prior information into the iterative restoration procedure. In addition, according to the weighted aggregation idea, a multi-model strategy is put forward to enhance the network stability that favors to avoid getting trapped in local optima. Extensive experiments on image deblurring and deblocking tasks show that the proposed algorithm is efficient, robust, and yields state-of-the-art restoration quality on grayscale images.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent development of object detection mainly depends on deep learning with large-scale benchmarks. However, collecting such fully-annotated data is often difficult or expensive for real-world applications, which restricts the power of deep neural networks in practice. Alternatively, humans can detect new objects with little annotation burden, since humans often use the prior knowledge to identify new objects with few elaborately-annotated examples, and subsequently generalize this capacity by exploiting objects from wild images. Inspired by this procedure of learning to detect, we propose a novel Progressive Object Transfer Detection (POTD) framework. Specifically, we make three main contributions in this paper. First, POTD can leverage various object supervision of different domains effectively into a progressive detection procedure. Via such human-like learning, one can boost a target detection task with few annotations. Second, POTD consists of two delicate transfer stages, i.e., Low-Shot Transfer Detection (LSTD), and Weakly-Supervised Transfer Detection (WSTD). In LSTD, we distill the implicit object knowledge of source detector to enhance target detector with few annotations. It can effectively warm up WSTD later on. In WSTD, we design a recurrent object labelling mechanism for learning to annotate weakly-labeled images. More importantly, we exploit the reliable object supervision from LSTD, which can further enhance the robustness of target detector in the WSTD stage. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on a number of challenging detection benchmarks with different settings. The results demonstrate that, our POTD outperforms the recent state-of-the-art approaches. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/Cassie94/LSTD/tree/lstd.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>It is challenging to convert a hazy color image into a gray-scale image because the color contrast field of a hazy image is distorted. In this paper, a novel decolorization algorithm is proposed to transfer a hazy image into a distortion-recovered gray-scale image. To recover the color contrast field, the relationship between the restored color contrast and its distorted input is presented in CIELab color space. Based on this restoration, a nonlinear optimization problem is formulated to construct the resultant gray-scale image. A new differentiable approximation solution is introduced to solve this problem with an extension of the Huber loss function. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm effectively preserves the global luminance consistency while represents the original color contrast in gray-scales, which is very close to the corresponding ground truth gray-scale one.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Light field (LF) stitching is a potential solution to improve the field of view (FOV) for hand-held plenoptic cameras. Existing LF stitching methods cannot provide accurate registration for scenes with large depth variation. In this paper, a novel LF stitching method is proposed to handle parallax in the LFs more flexibly and accurately. First, a depth layer map (DLM) is proposed to guarantee adequate feature points on each depth layer. For the regions of nondeterministic depth, superpixel layer map (SLM) is proposed based on LF spatial correlation analysis to refine the depth layer assignments. Then, DLM-SLM-based LF registration is proposed to derive the location dependent homography transforms accurately and to warp LFs to its corresponding position without parallax interference. 4D graph-cut is further applied to fuse the registration results for higher LF spatial continuity and angular continuity. Horizontal, vertical and multi-LF stitching are tested for different scenes, which demonstrates the superior performance provided by the proposed method in terms of subjective quality of the stitched LFs, epipolar plane image consistency in the stitched LF, and perspective-averaged correlation between the stitched LF and the input LFs.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, we outline a novel bilevel decision-making framework for a price-maker virtual power plant (VPP) to participate in both day-ahead and balancing oligopoly markets considering multiple forward contracts. In principle, the VPP operator with having the possession of financial transmission rights can manage its financial risk through trading electricity among various markets such as centralized pool and contract markets aimed at maximizing its own profit and minimizing the associated risk. Besides, the VPP operator will be able to optimize its procurement expenditures by incentivizing flexible demands proportion to different electricity tariffs. In the proposed bilevel model, the VPP aggregator strives to maximize its own profit at the upper level while an independent system operator seeks to clear both markets at the lower levels with an eye to maximize social welfare. Each lower level is then replaced by its complementarity slackness conditions and, consequently, is recast as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints that can be solved using off-the-shelf software packages. Furthermore, the uncertainty pertaining to renewables has been envisaged through information gap decision theory resulting in robustness&#x002f;opportunity function to deal with self-scheduling of VPP. This article ends up with different illustrative case studies through performing after-the-fact actual market data to verify the applicability of the model.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to the property of multiple solutions, redundant robot manipulators are usually required to simultaneously achieve multiple objectives in complex applications. The research of robustness for scheme formulation and optimization becomes an increasingly important issue for motion planning of redundant robot manipulators. From the perspective of optimization, a robust hybrid multiobjective (RHMO) scheme with a new disturbance rejection constraint is proposed in this article to achieve simultaneously four objectives together with the suppression of external time-varying disturbances. Theoretical results on the property of disturbance rejection are shown to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed RHMO scheme with a new disturbance rejection constraint. The RHMO scheme is then reformulated as dynamical quadratic programming with its solution found via the piecewise-linear projection equation neural network. Numerical experiments, tests, and comparisons on the basis of a PA10 manipulator verify the effectiveness, robustness, and superiority of the RHMO scheme with the new constraint for the motion planning and optimization of redundant robot manipulators against time-varying disturbances.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The robust multimodel solution for multiple-input single-output nonlinear time-delay systems identification with polluted outputs is derived in this article. First, all the local autoregressive exogenous models are preidentified at the working points; then, the global system model is built by interpolating the local models with a smoothing strategy. The outliers and input time-delays which often increase the nonideality of process data are both considered. To cope with the outliers, the Laplace distribution is reutilized to describe the output measurement process and the negative impact resulted from each outlier imposed on parameter estimation can be suppressed through automatically assigned small weight. The parameter estimation procedure is realized with the expectation&#x2013;maximization algorithm and the joint posterior probability of all input delays is also maximized to calculate the unknown input time-delays. With the verifications on a numerical example and the continuous fermentation process, the validity of the proposed approach is proved.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Dynamics and nonlinearity may exist in the time and batch directions for batch processes, thereby complicating the monitoring of these processes. In this article, we propose a two-dimensional deep correlated representation learning (2D-DCRL) method to achieve the efficient fault detection and isolation of the nonlinear batch processes. Three-way historical data are first unfolded as two-way time-slice data. Second, a stacked autoencoder based deep neural network is constructed to characterize the correlation among the process variables. Considering that the time and batch directions may be dynamic, for each time-slice measurement, a constructed 2-D measurement containing samples from the previous time instants and batches is then obtained. Subsequently, DCRL is performed between the current running-batch measurements and the constructed 2-D measurements to characterize the 2-D dynamics and nonlinearity. The 2D-DCRL-based monitoring examines the status of a sample by considering the 2-D nonlinear and dynamic information, providing improved monitoring performance. Applications on two typical batch processes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 2D-DCRL monitoring scheme.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We study the trade-off between secret message (SM) and secret key (SK) rates, simultaneously achievable over a state-dependent (SD) wiretap channel (WTC) with non-causal channel state information (CSI) at the encoder. This model subsumes other instances of CSI availability as special cases, and calls for efficient utilization of the state sequence for both reliability and security purposes. An inner bound on the semantic-security (SS) SM-SK capacity region is derived based on a superposition coding scheme inspired by a past work of the authors. The region is shown to attain capacity for a certain class of SD-WTCs. SS is established by virtue of two versions of the strong soft-covering lemma. The derived region yields an improvement upon the previously best known SM-SK trade-off result reported by Prabhakaran et al., and, to the best of our knowledge, upon all other existing lower bounds for either SM or SK for this setup, even if the semantic security requirement is relaxed to weak secrecy. It is demonstrated that our region can be strictly larger than those reported in the preceding works.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We propose Mask SSD, an efficient and effective approach to address the challenging instance segmentation task. Based on a single-shot detector, Mask SSD detects all instances in an image and marks the pixels that belong to each instance. It consists of a detection subnetwork that predicts object categories and bounding box locations, and an instance-level segmentation subnetwork that generates the foreground mask for each instance. In the detection subnetwork, multi-scale and feedback features from different layers are used to better represent objects of various sizes and provide high-level semantic information. Then, we adopt an assistant classification network to guide per-class score prediction, which consists of objectness prior and category likelihood. The instance-level segmentation subnetwork outputs pixel-wise segmentation for each detection while providing the multi-scale and feedback features from different layers as input. These two subnetworks are jointly optimized by a multi-task loss function, which renders Mask SSD direct prediction on detection and segmentation results. We conduct extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC, SBD, and MS COCO datasets to evaluate the performance of Mask SSD. Experimental results verify that as compared with state-of-the-art approaches, our proposed method has a comparable precision with less speed overhead.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Squirrel-cage induction motor (SQIM) fed by a pulsewidth modulated voltage source inverter (VSI) is subjected to voltage and current surges. It may cause additional losses in the motor, insulation failure, high bearing current, and electromagnetic interference. To mitigate these problems, sinusoidal LC filter is placed at the ac-side of the VSI. This paper proposes a new methodology to design the filter. In this method, the filter inductance is chosen based on the maximum ripple in the inverter ac-side current and the voltage drop across the filter inductor, and the filter capacitor is chosen based on the steady-state reactive power demand of the SQIM. The effects of the designed filter on the switch current, losses in the drive, temperature of the dc-link capacitor, dv&#x002f;dt at the motor terminal, stator flux, and air-gap torque of the SQIM are discussed. The performance of the drive with the filters, designed by the proposed method and the standard method, are experimentally tested on a two-level silicon carbide VSI-fed SQIM and comparative analysis is carried out. The impact of the designed filter on the drive is also shown when the neutral point of the filter capacitors is connected with the mid-point of the dc link. The stability of the closed-loop controlled SQIM drive with the proposed filter, and simulation results are presented to verify its performance.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>For high-speed permanent magnet machines (HSPMMs), the permanent magnet (PM) is more likely to suffer irreversible demagnetization because the heat dissipation is serious in the HSPMMs, especially for the high-power machines. This paper focuses on the comprehensive research results on the power loss and thermal characteristic for a high-power HSPMM. First, the power loss at the rated load is investigated by finite-element analysis. Then, the temperature distribution of four cooling schemes is compared by the electromagnetic-thermal iteration calculation. The effect of different parameters on thermal behavior is obtained to reduce rotor temperature, which includes an examination of the axial flow duct, cooling medium, sleeve thickness, and sleeve thermal conductivity. Finally, an improved loss separation method is employed to obtain the loss distribution from the measured total loss, and the comprehensive experiments are implemented based on one HSPMM prototype (800 kW, 15 000 rpm) to verify the related theoretical analysis.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Differential power processing (DPP) is a promising architecture to solve the issue caused by mismatches among photovoltaic (PV) submodules. To eliminate the mismatch power losses, this paper presents an optimized PV-to-bus DPP system with submodule-level individual maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and module-level minimum-power tracking (MPT) simultaneous implementation according to the built mathematical model of the power processed by DPP converters with respect to the string current. Furthermore, a flexible time-sharing algorithm is adopted to reduce the number of MPPT units. Compared with other solutions, such as PV optimizer, the proposed scheme can reduce the effects of mismatches to the minimum regardless of mismatch conditions. The system cost is reduced since only one adaptive MPPT controller is required. Besides, the system efficiency is improved due to the true MPPT implementation and MPT control. Both simulation and experimental tests are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Time delay control (TDC) is a promising technique for robot manipulators because it is model-free, efficient, and yet, robust. Nevertheless, when a robot operates under significant payload changes, it is difficult to achieve satisfactory performance with a constant gain. To cope with this problem, several adaptive rules have already been proposed thus far, but they are less effective to significant payload changes, and parameter tuning procedures are too complicated. In this paper, we propose an adaptive gain dynamics that is more effective in payload changes and yet simpler to implement. Through simulations using a one-link arm and experiments using a whole arm manipulator with payload changes, the proposed dynamics was compared with the conventional TDC and two other existing methods. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can adapt to significant payload changes, achieving better accuracy than the conventional TDC. Experimental results show that the proposed method has consistently better adaptation capability than other methods, achieving significantly better accuracy. In addition, the proposed method is simpler to implement, having only one tuning parameter, whereas the existing methods require four or five such tuning parameters.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents an adaptive self-configurable rectifier to increase the range of vibration excitation that a piezoelectric energy harvesting power management circuit (PMC) can operate with. The proposed circuit configures itself as a voltage doubler (VD) to increase the low voltage of piezoelectric energy harvesters to meet the minimum operating voltage of the PMC. This allows energy harvesting from low voltage range that is not viable using a full-wave bridge (FB) rectifier. When the piezoelectric voltage increases and causes the voltage amplified by the VD to approach the maximum operating voltage of the PMC, the proposed circuit reconfigures itself to an FB rectifier that does not amplify the voltage. This allows operation at a higher voltage range that is restricted by the VD topology. Two different reference voltages each for the VD topology and the FB rectifier topology with low-pass filtering are used to ensure correct switching of the rectifier topology. The proposed control circuit can cold start from a piezoelectric voltage of 1.2&#x00a0;V in the VD topology to amplify the voltage to allow an existing PMC that needs a minimum input voltage higher than 1.2&#x00a0;V to operate while consuming 240&#x2013;410&#x00a0;nW of power. With the two-reference-voltages control method, 20&#x0025; more energy can be transferred through the PMC than the one without it.
