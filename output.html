<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org">EurekAlert! - Breaking News</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Many rural areas in parts of the US rely exclusively on groundwater for both agricultural and domestic use. Drilling deeper wells may not be a good long-term solution to compensate for increasing demands on groundwater, because there is potential for contamination of deep fresh and brackish water in areas where the oil and gas industry injects wastewaters into or in close proximity to aquifers. The study was published Nov. 14 in Environmental Research Letters.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p><span class="paragraphSection"><strong>In Reply</strong> In response to Drs Thombs and Ziegelstein, the EsDEPACS trial was preplanned as a component of the larger Korean Depression in Acute Coronary Syndrome (K-DEPACS) study investigating interrelationships between depression and cardiac outcomes following ACS using randomized and prospective observational designs. Cardiovascular outcomes have been described and reported in the previously published design article including both the EsDEPACS and K-DEPACS studies and in prior research using this data set. We agree that MACE has been inconsistently defined in this field, but our MACE definition (a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and percutaneous coronary intervention) has been used in well-cited cardiovascular research studies and so is not unique to our work. Concerning treatment effects, we believe that an incorrect comparison is being made. Thombs and Ziegelstein present results for the primary analysis based on the total sample of 300 patients. However, to compare with the number achieving remission of depression, the post hoc analysis of 217 patients achieving remission must be used. The difference in MACE numbers was 15 between the placebo group (n&#8201;=&#8201;61) and escitalopram group (n&#8201;=&#8201;46), in line with the differences in depression remission. The difference in MACE occurrence appearing beyond 1 year after randomization is a reasonable concern. However, a meta-analysis of 16 studies of depression following ACS found that differences in MACE occurrence became prominent after 1 year and over longer follow-up intervals; this is in keeping with our findings, although we agree that further replication should be sought.</span>

<p>An alarm bell is ringing around the world today: for the second straight year, there is a flatlining of what had been a steady decline in the global malaria epidemic. From 2000 to 2015, the malaria control community had grown accustomed to celebrating the annual reported reduction in cases and deaths. Millions of lives were saved through use of vector control measures, diagnosis, and treatment. Exorbitant health-care costs for many people were averted. Children could attend school instead of a health facility.

<p>The British colonial administration in West Africa in the first half of the 20th century operated an explicitly racist employment policy, including in its medical service: no African medical professional could reach a position of authority over white colleagues. At the same time, medical training had only recently become accessible to women in the UK, and was non-existent within Ghana, or the Gold Coast as it was known until independence. So it is remarkable that under these circumstances three West African women qualified as doctors and showed by their example the crucial role of women in advancing maternal and child health.

Their trial compares the effect of a sliding hip screw versus cancellous screws on the risk of reoperation in patients with a low-energy hip fracture requiring fracture fixation.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Garbled circuits are general tools that allow two parties to compute any function without disclosing their respective inputs. Applications of this technique vary from distributed privacy-preserving machine learning tasks to secure outsourced authentication. Unfortunately, the energy cost of garbled circuit evaluation protocols is substantial. This limits the applicability of garbled circuits in scenarios that involve battery-operated devices, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and smartphones. In this paper, we propose MEG, a Memory- and Energy-efficient Garbled circuit evaluation mechanism. MEG utilizes batch data transmission and multi-threading to reduce memory and energy consumption. We implement MEG on an Android smartphone and compare its performance and energy consumption with state-of-the-art techniques using two garbled circuits of widely different sizes (AES-128 and 256-bit edit distance). Our results show that, compared with &#x201c;plain&#x201d; garbled circuit evaluation, MEG decreases memory consumption by more than 90%. When compared with current pipelined garbled circuit evaluation techniques, MEG's energy usage was 42% lower for AES-128 and 23% lower for EDT-256. Furthermore, our multi-thread implementation of MEG decreased circuit evaluation time by up to 56.7% for AES-128, and by up to 13.5% for EDT-256, compared with state-of-the-art pipelining techniques.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>DC-link current ripple is one of the important factors for operating the current-source converter. In practice, the dc-link current ripple can be reduced by increasing the switching frequency or inductance. However, it may result in the higher switching losses, larger size, or higher cost. In order to deal with this problem, the inherent limitation of the conventional solution is discussed in this paper. The time-domain equation of the dc-link current is established for the first time. And then, a new space vector control strategy is proposed to reduce the ripple with no need of increasing the switching frequency or inductance. The space vector is divided into 12 sectors, where the dc-link current ripple can be effectively reduced by the optimal vector sequence. Finally, the proposed method is implemented on the TMS320F28335DSP + XC3400FPGA digital control hardware platform. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To meet the required huge data analysis, organization, and storage demand, the hashing technique has got a lot of attention as it aims to learn an efficient binary representation from the original high-dimensional data. In this paper, we focus on the unsupervised spectral hashing due to its effective manifold embedding. Existing spectral hashing methods mainly suffer from two problems, i.e., the inefficient spectral candidate and intractable binary constraint for spectral analysis. To overcome these two problems, we propose to employ spectral rotation to seek a better spectral solution and adopt the alternating projection algorithm to settle the complex code constraints, which are therefore named as Spectral Hashing with Spectral Rotation and Alternating Discrete Spectral Hashing, respectively. To enjoy the merits of both methods, the spectral rotation technique is finally combined with the original spectral objective, which aims to simultaneously learn better spectral solution and more efficient discrete codes and is called as Discrete Spectral Hashing. Furthermore, the efficient optimization algorithms are also provided, which just take comparable time complexity to existing hashing methods. To evaluate the proposed three methods, extensive comparison experiments and studies are conducted on four large-scale data sets for the image retrieval task, and the noticeable performance beats several state-of-the-art spectral hashing methods on different evaluation metrics.

To achieve this objective, it is very important to analyze the temporal dynamics of mouse behaviors. In particular, the change between mouse neighboring actions is swift in a short period. In this paper, we develop and implement a novel hidden Markov model (HMM) algorithm to describe the temporal characteristics of mouse behaviors. In particular, we here propose a hybrid deep learning architecture, where the first unsupervised layer relies on an advanced spatial-temporal segment Fisher vector encoding both visual and contextual features. Subsequent supervised layers based on our segment aggregate network are trained to estimate the state-dependent observation probabilities of the HMM. The proposed architecture shows the ability to discriminate between visually similar behaviors and results in high recognition rates with the strength of processing imbalanced mouse behavior datasets. Finally, we evaluate our approach using JHuang's and our own datasets, and the results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Given a group photograph, it is interesting and useful to judge whether the characters in it share specific kinship relation, such as father-daughter, father-son, mother-daughter, or mother-son. Recently, facial image-based kinship verification has attracted wide attention in computer vision. Some metric learning algorithms have been developed for improving kinship verification. However, most of the existing algorithms ignore fusing multiple feature representations and utilizing kernel techniques. In this paper, we develop a novel weighted graph embedding-based metric learning (WGEML) framework for kinship verification. Inspired by the fact that family members usually show high similarity in facial features like eyes, noses, and mouths, despite their diversity, we jointly learn multiple metrics by constructing an intrinsic graph and two penalty graphs to characterize the intraclass compactness and interclass separability for each feature representation, respectively, so that both the consistency and complementarity among multiple features can be fully exploited. Meanwhile, combination weights are determined through a weighted graph embedding framework. Furthermore, we present a kernelized version of WGEML to tackle nonlinear problems. Experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Person re-identification (re-ID) is a cross-camera retrieval task that suffers from image style variations caused by different cameras. The art implicitly addresses this problem by learning a camera-invariant descriptor subspace. In this paper, we explicitly consider this challenge by introducing camera style (CamStyle). CamStyle can serve as a data augmentation approach that reduces the risk of deep network overfitting and that smooths the CamStyle disparities. Specifically, with a style transfer model, labeled training images can be style transferred to each camera, and along with the original training samples, form the augmented training set. This method, while increasing data diversity against overfitting, also incurs a considerable level of noise. In the effort to alleviate the impact of noise, the label smooth regularization (LSR) is adopted. The vanilla version of our method (without LSR) performs reasonably well on few camera systems in which overfitting often occurs. With LSR, we demonstrate consistent improvement in all systems regardless of the extent of overfitting. We also report competitive accuracy compared with the state of the art on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-re-ID. Importantly, CamStyle can be employed to the challenging problems of one view learning and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in person re-identification (re-ID), both of which have critical research and application significance. The former only has labeled data in one camera view and the latter only has labeled data in the source domain. Experimental results show that CamStyle significantly improves the performance of the baseline in the two problems. Specially, for UDA, CamStyle achieves state-of-the-art accuracy based on a baseline deep re-ID model on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zhunzhong07/CamStyle.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Blind image deblurring, i.e., deblurring without knowledge of the blur kernel, is a highly ill-posed problem. The problem can be solved in two parts: 1) estimate a blur kernel from the blurry image, and 2) given an estimated blur kernel, de-convolve the blurry input to restore the target image. In this paper, we propose a graph-based blind image deblurring algorithm by interpreting an image patch as a signal on a weighted graph. Specifically, we first argue that a skeleton image&#x2014;a proxy that retains the strong gradients of the target but smooths out the details&#x2014;can be used to accurately estimate the blur kernel and has a unique bi-modal edge weight distribution. Then, we design a reweighted graph total variation (RGTV) prior that can efficiently promote a bi-modal edge weight distribution given a blurry patch. Further, to analyze RGTV in the graph frequency domain, we introduce a new weight function to represent RGTV as a graph  $l_{1}$  -Laplacian regularizer. This leads to a graph spectral filtering interpretation of the prior with desirable properties, including robustness to noise and blur, strong piecewise smooth filtering, and sharpness promotion. Minimizing a blind image deblurring objective with RGTV results in a non-convex non-differentiable optimization problem. Leveraging the new graph spectral interpretation for RGTV, we design an efficient algorithm that solves for the skeleton image and the blur kernel alternately. Specifically for Gaussian blur, we propose a further speedup strategy for blind Gaussian deblurring using accelerated graph spectral filtering. Finally, with the computed blur kernel, recent non-blind image deblurring algorithms can be applied to restore the target image. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm successfully restores latent sharp images and outperforms the state-of-the-art-
methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper introduces a new similarity measure, the covering similarity, which we formally define for evaluating the similarity between a symbolic sequence and a set of symbolic sequences. A pairwise similarity can also be directly derived from the covering similarity to compare two symbolic sequences. An efficient implementation to compute the covering similarity is proposed which uses a suffix-tree data structure, but other implementations, based on suffix array for instance, are possible and are possibly necessary for handling very large-scale problems. We have used this similarity to isolate attack sequences from normal sequences in the scope of host-based intrusion detection. We have assessed the covering similarity on two well-known benchmarks in the field. In view of the results reported on these two datasets for the state-of-the-art methods, according to the comparative study, we have carried out based on three challenging similarity measures commonly used for string processing, or in bioinformatics, we show that the covering similarity is particularly relevant to address the detection of anomalies in sequences of system calls.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to its cost efficiency, the controller area network (CAN) is still the most wide-spread in-vehicle bus, and the numerous reported attacks demonstrate the urgency in designing new security solutions for CAN. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection mechanism that takes advantage of Bloom filtering to test frame periodicity based on message identifiers and parts of the data-field which facilitates detection of potential replay or modification attacks. This proves to be an effective approach since most of the traffic from in-vehicle buses is cyclic in nature and the format of the data-field is fixed due to rigid signal allocation. Bloom filters provide an efficient time-memory tradeoff which is beneficial for the constrained resources of automotive grade controllers. We test the correctness of our approach and obtain good results on an industry-standard CANoe-based simulation for a J1939 commercial-vehicle bus and also on CAN with flexible data-rate traces obtained from a real-world high-end vehicle. The proposed filtering mechanism is straightforward to adapt for any other time-triggered in-vehicle bus, e.g., FlexRay, since it is built on time-driven characteristics.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Three-dimensional mask spoofing attacks have been one of the main challenges in face recognition. Compared with a 3D mask, a real face displays different facial motion patterns that are reflected by different facial dynamic textures. However, a large portion of these facial motion differences is subtle. We find that the subtle facial motion can be fully captured by multiple deep dynamic textures from a convolutional layer of a convolutional neural network, but not all deep dynamic textures from different spatial regions and different channels of a convolutional layer are useful for differentiation of subtle motions between real faces and 3D masks. In this paper, we propose a novel feature learning model to learn discriminative deep dynamic textures for 3D mask face anti-spoofing. A novel joint discriminative learning strategy is further incorporated in the learning model to jointly learn the spatial- and channel-discriminability of the deep dynamic textures. The proposed joint discriminative learning strategy can be used to adaptively weight the discriminability of the learned feature from different spatial regions or channels, which ensures that more discriminative deep dynamic textures play more important roles in face/mask classification. Experiments on several publicly available data sets validate that the proposed method achieves promising results in intra- and cross-data set scenarios.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we consider user scheduling and power allocation techniques for downlinks where transmitted message must be kept confidential from all other unintended users and the number of users is larger than that of access point (AP) antennas. In order to maximize network secrecy rate with a limited number of antennas, the AP schedules a user who can achieve the largest secrecy rate and exploits multiple antennas for transmitting artificial noise to the unintended users. We derive the closed-form expressions of the optimal power allocation for the artificial noise and the average network secrecy rate through asymptotic analysis. The analysis results provide the insightful information on the behaviors of the user scheduling and the effect of system parameters on the network secrecy rate performance. It is shown that opportunistic scheduling with artificial noise transmission technique is more effective than the conventional precoding techniques for multiple confidential message transmissions in terms of network secrecy rate. Furthermore, we have also discussed a transmission strategy for the worst case scenarios where all unintended users are treated as colluding eavesdroppers. The simulations confirm the validity of the analysis results and provide additional information on the network performance in general cases.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To improve the power transfer efficiency in wireless power transfer systems, a novel configuration of a magnetic resonant structure is proposed in this paper. According to the analytical expression of mutual inductance, the magnetic field can be improved by weakening the demagnetizing factor for coils with a ferrite core. In this paper, the demagnetizing factors of a cylindrical ferrite core and a novel ferrite core are investigated. Compared with the cylindrical ferrite core, the proposed ferrite core has a smaller demagnetizing factor and an increased mutual inductance. In addition, the magnetic field through the receiving coil is enhanced due to the thin ferrite axis where the magnetic field is concentrated. The proposed ferrite core is designed and analyzed. Moreover, the effects of pitch and lateral misalignment, as well as the number of turns of the receiving coil, the core loss, and the load, are studied. Experimental prototypes are established to validate the performance of the wireless power transfer system with different types of receiving structures. The results indicate that the proposed structure is superior to others and that it shows better performance in power transfer efficiency and transfer distance, which is in good agreement with the theoretical and simulation analysis.

<p>Micro-short-circuit (MSC) is a latent risk in power batteries, which may give rise to thermal runaway and even catastrophic safety hazards. The motivation of this paper is to quantitatively analyze MSC in an initial stage, particularly for lithium-ion batteries. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, an equivalent MSC experiment is carried out. Based on a cell difference model, the cell state of charge (SOC) differences with the mean SOC for a battery pack are estimated by extended Kalman filter. The evaluated SOC difference can track the actual value well. Furthermore, an MSC diagnostic method is developed by employing recursive least squares filter. The method is demonstrated to examine the short-circuit resistance accurately. The results also show that the proposed method requires low computational load for the SOC difference and short-circuit resistance diagnosis.

<p>In order to develop the flux dipping process, a quantitative mathematical model that accurately describes the flux dipping process in the flip-chip bonding is proposed. The whole dynamic dipping process is captured by the high-speed transient imaging followed by image processing. Curve fitting of experimental results yields the relation between flux dipping quantity and process parameters. It suggests a quadratic function of quantity ( $Q$) with respect to dipping depth ( $d$), and a piece-wise function to dipping speed ( $v$) including an exponential section and a quadratic or linear section. While the coupled effect of d and v can be expressed as a merged function of $Q= f_{(d,v)}$, these mathematical models are proved to be effective when applied to the actual dipping process practiced on a flip-chip bonding machine, thus providing a reliable mathematical basis for optimizing dipping flux in industrial manufacturing.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A microgrid may comprise several zones with local loads and distributed generation resources. If a fault occurs in a zone, then a static switch between the faulty and fault-free zones must be activated to detect/classify the faults and enable the breaker to open the circuit immediately. This paper presents a new method for designing a detection/classification module in a static switch using the Park Transform (PT), Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) and Takagi&#x2013;Sugeno&#x2013;Kang (TSK) fuzzy rules. Both wavelet coefficients/energies of the d-axis component, within 0.96&#x2013;1.92 kHz, obtained by MRA and PT are employed to effectively detect and classify the fault types using the local fault signals near the static switch without a complicated communication system. The proposed TSK fuzzy rules, defined by the scenario data only, successfully classify the faults. The proposed method is verified by hardware-in-the-loop simulation using a real-time digital simulator and a realistic 5 kVA static switch. The proposed method is implemented in a Xilinx field-programmable gate array. Test results show that the proposed method is efficient in the real-time control environment of a microgrid.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep convolutional networks (CNNs) reign undisputed as the new de-facto method for computer vision tasks owning to their success in visual recognition task on still images. However, their adaptations to crowd counting have not clearly established their superiority over shallow models. Existing CNNs turn out to be self-limiting in challenging scenarios such as camera illumination changing, partial occlusions, diverse crowd distributions, and perspective distortions for crowd counting because of their shallow structure. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic augmentation technique to train a much deeper CNN for crowd counting. In order to decrease overfitting caused by limited number of training samples, multitask learning is further employed to learn generalizable representations across similar domains. We also propose to aggregate multiscale convolutional features extracted from the entire image into a compact single vector representation amenable to efficient and accurate counting by way of &#x201c;Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors&#x201d; (VLAD). The &#x201c;deeply supervised&#x201d; strategy is employed to provide additional supervision signal for bottom layers for further performance improvement. Experimental results on three benchmark crowd datasets show that our method achieves better performance than the existing methods. Our implementation will be released at https://github.com/shizenglin/Multitask-Multiscale-Deep-NetVLAD.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Regarding the potentials of activating commercial consumers in demand response programs, this paper proposes a new framework for energy scheduling of an active distribution network based on the concept of technical virtual power plant (TVPP), considering operational constraints of distribution network. The TVPP enables presence of commercial buildings and other distributed energy resources in day-ahead (DA) electricity market, as a price maker agent. In this regard, a bilevel optimization framework is designed to optimize the bidding strategy of TVPP in the DA market with the main goal of maximizing TVPP profit. The upper-level problem maximizes the TVPP profit, while in the lower level, market is cleared from independent system operator viewpoint. Using Karush&#x2014;Kuhn&#x2013;Tucker optimality conditions and strong duality theory, the proposed bilevel problem is transformed into mixed integer linear programming problem. Implementing the model on the Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS) test system demonstrates the applicability of the proposed model.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In pursuit of the time-optimal motion of an industrial robot along a desired path, a previously identified model is typically used to calculate the required inputs for perfect tracking. An inevitable model-plant mismatch, however, causes the obtained inputs to be suboptimal&#x2014;resulting in poor tracking performance&#x2014;or even be infeasible by exceeding given limits. This paper, at hand, presents a two-step iterative learning algorithm that compensates for such model-plant mismatch and finds the time-optimal motion, improving tracking performance, and ensuring feasibility. Due to an efficient solution of the path tracking problem using a sequential convex log barrier method, the delay between consecutive task executions is eliminated. To show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, an experimental validation on a standard industrial manipulator is performed, illustrating that the developed approach is capable of reducing the execution time while at the same time improving the tracking performance.
