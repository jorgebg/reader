<div class="itemdescription">
<p>On Nov 28, 2018, during the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing in Hong Kong, He Jiankui and colleagues from China claimed that they have edited the human embryonic genome to disable the CCR5 gene in work that resulted in the birth of twin sisters.1 The announcement generated serious concerns relating to scientific ethics. As Chinese professionals engaged in HIV research and prevention, we strongly oppose genome editing on healthy human germline cells and embryos for reproductive purposes and HIV prevention.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Indonesia is a rapidly growing middle-income country with 262 million inhabitants from more than 300 ethnic and 730 language groups spread over 17&#8200;744 islands, and presents unique challenges for health systems and universal health coverage (UHC). From 1960 to 2001, the centralised health system of Indonesia made gains as medical care infrastructure grew from virtually no primary health centres to 20&#8200;900 centres. Life expectancy improved from 48 to 69 years, infant mortality decreased from 76 deaths per 1000 livebirths to 23 per 1000, and the total fertility rate decreased from 5&#183;61 to 2&#183;11.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The inherent second-harmonic ripple power in a cascaded H-bridge (CHB)-based motor drive system poses the demand of large capacitors in the dc link of each cell. In this paper, an active power decoupling method based on negative sequence current injection and its corresponding dual voltage closed-loop control are proposed to solve this problem without adding any extra components. The proposed dual voltage closed-loop control system consists of a conventional active power control loop and a frequency-adaptive ripple power control loop. The ripple power control loop aims at injecting a set of negative sequence decoupling currents into the front ends of the cells to remove the ripple powers with variable frequency. Higher steady-state accuracy and robustness are, therefore, achieved compared to the open-loop control. Moreover, to simplify the control system, the ripple power control loop can be integrated into the active power control loop without introducing a harmonic reference frame transformation. By adopting the proposed control, the dc capacitance can be reduced to less than 10&#x0025; of the conventional case. The effectiveness and practicability of this method are verified by simulation and experimental results.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a novel oversampling deadbeat current control approach for permanent magnet synchronous motor drives capable of operating at a controller sampling frequency multiple of the power converter switching frequency. Model-based controllers suffer from heavy computational demand and performance degradation due to parameter uncertainties. The proposed controller concurrently with field-programmable gate array implementation permits to achieve a constant switching frequency and an optimal current ripple along with a high current-loop bandwidth and robust behavior to parameter variation. A disturbance observer has been added to the proposed controller in order to compensate for the converter voltage distortions. The proposed control strategy is tested through both simulations and experiments.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>High step-up converters are required for distributed photovoltaic generation systems, due to the low voltage of the photovoltaic source. In this paper, a new hybrid high voltage gain dc&#x2013;dc converter is created by merging the standard boost converter with a coupled inductor and different switched-capacitor techniques. With a single switch and no requirement of higher duty cycle values, the proposed converter achieves a high voltage gain and high efficiency, in addition to lowered voltage and current stresses of the components. A 200-W prototype was implemented experimentally to evaluate the converter, which reached a maximum efficiency of 97.6&#x0025;.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The employment of solar microconverter allows a more detailed monitoring of the photovoltaic (PV) output power at the single module level; thus, machine learning techniques are capable to track the peculiarities of modules in the PV plants, such as regular shadings. In this way, it is possible to compare in real time the day-ahead forecast power with the actual one in order to better evaluate faults or anomalous trends that might have occurred in the PV plant. This paper presents a method for an effective fault diagnosis; this method is based on the day-ahead forecast of the output power from an existing PV module, linked to a microconverter, and on the outcome of the neighbor PV modules. Finally, this paper also proposes the analysis of the most common error definitions with new mathematical formulations, by comparing their effectiveness and immediate comprehension, in view of increasing power forecasting accuracy and performing both real-time and offline analysis of PV modules performance and possible faults.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A new multi-site brain imaging study in The American Journal of Psychiatry shows that sub-groups of people use their brains differently when imitating emotional faces -- a task that reflects their ability to interact socially. Interestingly, individuals with schizophrenia do not have categorically different social brain function than those without mental illness, but fall into different sub-groups that may respond to different types of treatments. These findings call into question the most common research approaches in mental health.

<p><span class="paragraphSection"><strong>In Reply</strong> It is promising that institutes such as the NHGRI have chosen to invest in projects addressing the return of individual research results, as Dr Kaufman and colleagues highlight. Conducting rigorous research to answer the &#8220;what, when, and how&#8221; to return these results is important to move the field forward. Although some extant literature exists as identified in their letter, most published studies have focused on the return of genetics research results, which is an important area for consideration. However, empirical data are lacking on the return of other types of results, even those as simple as routine laboratory results. As the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report recommends, an expanded empirical evidence base relevant to the return of individual research results is needed. The report also recommends mechanisms to accelerate evidence generation, such as research sponsors requiring applications to address return of results.</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p><span class="paragraphSection">Health care expenditures continue to increase in the United States, and there have been considerable efforts over the past decade to use health policies, financial incentives, and alternative payment models to address this important issue. Starting in 2007, the Centers for Medicaid &amp; Medicare Services (CMS) sought to reduce early readmissions for common medical conditions among Medicare beneficiaries. The CMS policy approaches included increasing transparency through public reporting of hospital 30-day risk standardized readmission rates (2007-2009 discharges) starting in 2009 and providing financial incentives tied to readmissions though the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), passed under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The HRRP imposed financial penalties on hospitals based on rates of 30-day risk-standardized hospital readmission for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and pneumonia, with up to 3% of a hospital&#8217;s total Medicare revenue from admissions for any condition (target or nontarget) at risk. In fiscal year 2018, 80% of the hospitals subject to the HRRP have been penalized, amounting to $564 million in reduced payments by Medicare.</span>

<p>Hyperspectral imagery collected from airborne or satellite sources inevitably suffers from spectral variability, making it difficult for spectral unmixing to accurately estimate abundance maps. The classical unmixing model, the linear mixing model (LMM), generally fails to handle this sticky issue effectively. To this end, we propose a novel spectral mixture model, called the augmented LMM, to address spectral variability by applying a data-driven learning strategy in inverse problems of hyperspectral unmixing. The proposed approach models the main spectral variability (i.e., scaling factors) generated by variations in illumination or typography separately by means of the endmember dictionary. It then models other spectral variabilities caused by environmental conditions (e.g., local temperature and humidity and atmospheric effects) and instrumental configurations (e.g., sensor noise), and material nonlinear mixing effects, by introducing a spectral variability dictionary. To effectively run the data-driven learning strategy, we also propose a reasonable prior knowledge for the spectral variability dictionary, whose atoms are assumed to be low-coherent with spectral signatures of endmembers, which leads to a well-known low-coherence dictionary learning problem. Thus, a dictionary learning technique is embedded in the framework of spectral unmixing so that the algorithm can learn the spectral variability dictionary and estimate the abundance maps simultaneously. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets are performed to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with the previous state-of-the-art methods.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a deep hashing framework, namely, unsupervised deep video hashing (UDVH), for large-scale video similarity search with the aim to learn compact yet effective binary codes. Our UDVH produces the hash codes in a self-taught manner by jointly integrating discriminative video representation with optimal code learning, where an efficient alternating approach is adopted to optimize the objective function. The key differences from most existing video hashing methods lie in: 1) UDVH is an unsupervised hashing method that generates hash codes by cooperatively utilizing feature clustering and a specifically designed binarization with the original neighborhood structure preserved in the binary space and 2) a specific rotation is developed and applied onto video features such that the variance of each dimension can be balanced, thus facilitating the subsequent quantization step. Extensive experiments performed on three popular video datasets show that the UDVH is overwhelmingly better than the state of the arts in terms of various evaluation metrics, which makes it practical in real-world applications.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In conventional wisdom of video modeling, the background is often treated as the primary target and foreground is derived using the technique of background subtraction. Based on the observation that foreground and background are two sides of the same coin, we propose to treat them as peer unknown variables and formulate a joint estimation problem, called Hierarchical modeling and Alternating Optimization (HMAO). The motivation behind our hierarchical extensions of background and foreground models is to better incorporate a priori knowledge about the disparity between background and foreground. For background, we decompose it into temporally low-frequency and high-frequency components for the purpose of better characterizing the class of video with dynamic background; for foreground, we construct a Markov random field prior at a spatially low resolution as the pivot to facilitate the noise-resilient refinement at higher resolutions. Built on hierarchical extensions of both models, we show how to successively refine their joint estimates under a unified framework known as alternating direction multipliers method. Experimental results have shown that our approach produces more discriminative background and demonstrates better robustness to noise than other competing methods. When compared against current state-of-the-art techniques, HMAO achieves at least comparable and often superior performance in terms of F-measure scores, especially for video containing dynamic and complex background.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Frontal view gait recognition for people identification has been carried out using single RGB, stereo RGB, Kinect 1.0, and Doppler radar. However, existing methods based on these camera technologies suffer from several problems. Therefore, we propose a four-part method for frontal view gait recognition based on the fusion of multiple features acquired from a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera. We have developed a gait data set captured by a ToF camera. The data set includes two sessions recorded seven months apart, with 46 and 33 subjects, respectively, each with six walks with five covariates. The four-part method includes: a new human silhouette extraction algorithm that reduces the multiple reflection problem experienced by ToF cameras; a frame selection method based on a new gait cycle detection algorithm; four new gait image representations; and a novel fusion classifier. Rigorous experiments are carried out to compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art methods. The results show distinct improvements over recognition rates for all covariates. The proposed method outperforms all major existing approaches for all covariates and results in 66.1% and 81.0% Rank 1 and Rank 5 recognition rates, respectively, in overall covariates, compared with a best state-of-the-art method performance of 35.7% and 57.7%.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Lung cancer is the type of cancer that most often kills after the initial diagnosis. To aid the specialist in its diagnosis, temporal evaluation is a potential tool for analyzing indeterminate lesions, which may be benign or malignant, during treatment. With this goal in mind, a methodology is herein proposed for the analysis, quantification, and visualization of changes in lung lesions. This methodology uses a modified version of the quality threshold clustering algorithm to associate each voxel of the lesion to a cluster, and changes in the lesion over time are defined in terms of voxel moves to another cluster. In addition, statistical features are extracted for classification of the lesion as benign or malignant. To develop the proposed methodology, two databases of pulmonary lesions were used, one for malignant lesions in treatment (public) and the other for indeterminate cases (private). We determined that the density change percentage varied from 6.22&#x0025; to 36.93&#x0025; of lesion volume in the public database of malignant lesions under treatment and from 19.98&#x0025; to 38.81&#x0025; in the private database of lung nodules. Additionally, other inter-cluster density change measures were obtained. These measures indicate the degree of change in the clusters and how each of them is abundant in relation to volume. From the statistical analysis of regions in which the density changes occurred, we were able to discriminate lung lesions with an accuracy of 98.41&#x0025;, demonstrating that these changes can indicate the true nature of the lesion. In addition to visualizing the density changes occurring in lesions over time, we quantified these changes and analyzed the entire set through volumetry, which is the technique most commonly used to analyze changes in pulmonary lesions.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Metaheuristic techniques have shown remarkable performance in a vast variety of engineering problems. Accurate solving of nonlinear equation set in selective harmonic elimination (SHE) has been one of the widely discussed numerical problems in power electronics. Current study aims at conducting an inclusive comparison of prominent stochastic methods adopted for SHE and modified SHE (MSHE) pulse width modulation techniques. The problem is defined as finding local optima of cascaded H-bride converter operation parameters. The survey investigates key indices of low-order harmonic components and weighted total harmonic distortion. Floating fundamental component is introduced for SHE and MSHE to achieve higher rate of flexibility for optimization techniques. Finally, an advanced modulation technique is proposed to address the dc-link voltage ripples. Simulation and experimental results are presented as a proof of concept.

<p>This paper investigates the peak-to-peak filtering problem for a class of networked nonlinear dc motor systems with quantization. The nonlinear dc motor system is modeled by a Takagi&#x2013;Sugeno (T&#x2013;S) fuzzy model. Consider that the measurement output signal and the performance output signal of the system are quantized by two static quantizers before being transmitted by the digital communication channel, respectively. Attention is focused on the design of a peak-to-peak filter such that the filtering error system is asymptotically stable and satisfies the prescribed peak-to-peak filtering performance index. Sufficient conditions for such a peak-to-peak filter are expressed in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, an illustrative simulation is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Effectively monitoring maritime environments has become a vital problem in maritime applications. Traditional methods are not only expensive and time consuming but also restricted in both time and space. More recently, the concept of an industrial wireless sensor network (IWSN) has become a promising alternative for monitoring next-generation intelligent maritime grids, because IWSNs are cost-effective and easy to deploy. This paper focuses on solving the issue of 3-D IWSN deployment in a 3-D engine room space of a very large crude-oil carrier and also considers numerous power facilities. To address this 3-D IWSN deployment problem for maritime applications, a 3-D uncertain coverage model is proposed that uses a modified 3-D sensing model and an uncertain fusion operator. The deployment problem is converted into a multiobjective optimization problem that simultaneously addresses three objectives: coverage, lifetime, and reliability. Our goal is to achieve extensive coverage, long network lifetime, and high reliability. We also propose a distributed parallel cooperative coevolutionary multiobjective large-scale evolutionary algorithm for maritime applications. We verify the effectiveness of this algorithm through experiments by comparing it with five state-of-the-art algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method performs most effectively both in optimization performance and in minimizing the computation time.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is used for the first time to detect fabricated defects in a glass fiber-skinned lightweight honeycomb composite panel. A novel amplitude polynomial regression (APR) algorithm is proposed as a preprocessing method. This method segments the amplitude&#x2013;frequency curves to simulate the heating and the cooling monotonic behavior as in infrared thermography. Then, the method of empirical orthogonal function (EOF) imaging is applied on the APR preprocessed data as a postprocessing algorithm. Signal-to-noise ratio analysis is performed to verify the image improvement of the proposed APR-EOF modality from a quantitative point of view. Finally, the experimental results and the physical analysis show that THz is more suitable with respect to the detection of defects in glass fiber lightweight honeycomb composites.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Depth information is being widely used in many real-world applications. However, due to the limitation of depth sensing technology, the captured depth map in practice usually has much lower resolution than that of color image counterpart. In this paper, we propose to combine the internal smoothness prior and external gradient consistency constraint in graph domain for depth super-resolution. On one hand, a new graph Laplacian regularizer is proposed to preserve the inherent piecewise smooth characteristic of depth, which has desirable filtering properties. A specific weight matrix of the respect graph is defined to make full use of information of both depth and the corresponding guidance image. On the other hand, inspired by an observation that the gradient of depth is small except at edge separating regions, we introduce a graph gradient consistency constraint to enforce that the graph gradient of depth is close to the thresholded gradient of guidance. We reinterpret the gradient thresholding model as variational optimization with sparsity constraint. In this way, we remedy the problem of structure discrepancy between depth and guidance. Finally, the internal and external regularizations are casted into a unified optimization framework, which can be efficiently addressed by ADMM. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art with respect to both objective and subjective quality evaluations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Online social networks (OSNs) are providing a variety of applications for human users to interact with families, friends, and even strangers. One such application, the friend search engine, allows the general public to query individual users' friend lists and has been gaining popularity recently. However, without proper design, this application may mistakenly disclose users' private relationship information. Our previous work has proposed a privacy preservation solution that can effectively boost OSNs' sociability while protecting users' friendship privacy against attacks launched by individual malicious requestors. In this paper, we propose an advanced collusion attack, where a victim user's friendship privacy can be compromised through a series of carefully designed queries coordinately launched by multiple malicious requestors. The effect of the proposed collusion attack is validated through synthetic and real-world social network data sets. The in-depth research on the advanced collusion attacks will help us design a more robust and secure friend search engine on OSNs in the near future.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Garbled circuits are general tools that allow two parties to compute any function without disclosing their respective inputs. Applications of this technique vary from distributed privacy-preserving machine learning tasks to secure outsourced authentication. Unfortunately, the energy cost of garbled circuit evaluation protocols is substantial. This limits the applicability of garbled circuits in scenarios that involve battery-operated devices, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and smartphones. In this paper, we propose MEG, a Memory- and Energy-efficient Garbled circuit evaluation mechanism. MEG utilizes batch data transmission and multi-threading to reduce memory and energy consumption. We implement MEG on an Android smartphone and compare its performance and energy consumption with state-of-the-art techniques using two garbled circuits of widely different sizes (AES-128 and 256-bit edit distance). Our results show that, compared with &#x201c;plain&#x201d; garbled circuit evaluation, MEG decreases memory consumption by more than 90%. When compared with current pipelined garbled circuit evaluation techniques, MEG's energy usage was 42% lower for AES-128 and 23% lower for EDT-256. Furthermore, our multi-thread implementation of MEG decreased circuit evaluation time by up to 56.7% for AES-128, and by up to 13.5% for EDT-256, compared with state-of-the-art pipelining techniques.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to its cost efficiency, the controller area network (CAN) is still the most wide-spread in-vehicle bus, and the numerous reported attacks demonstrate the urgency in designing new security solutions for CAN. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection mechanism that takes advantage of Bloom filtering to test frame periodicity based on message identifiers and parts of the data-field which facilitates detection of potential replay or modification attacks. This proves to be an effective approach since most of the traffic from in-vehicle buses is cyclic in nature and the format of the data-field is fixed due to rigid signal allocation. Bloom filters provide an efficient time-memory tradeoff which is beneficial for the constrained resources of automotive grade controllers. We test the correctness of our approach and obtain good results on an industry-standard CANoe-based simulation for a J1939 commercial-vehicle bus and also on CAN with flexible data-rate traces obtained from a real-world high-end vehicle. The proposed filtering mechanism is straightforward to adapt for any other time-triggered in-vehicle bus, e.g., FlexRay, since it is built on time-driven characteristics.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we consider user scheduling and power allocation techniques for downlinks where transmitted message must be kept confidential from all other unintended users and the number of users is larger than that of access point (AP) antennas. In order to maximize network secrecy rate with a limited number of antennas, the AP schedules a user who can achieve the largest secrecy rate and exploits multiple antennas for transmitting artificial noise to the unintended users. We derive the closed-form expressions of the optimal power allocation for the artificial noise and the average network secrecy rate through asymptotic analysis. The analysis results provide the insightful information on the behaviors of the user scheduling and the effect of system parameters on the network secrecy rate performance. It is shown that opportunistic scheduling with artificial noise transmission technique is more effective than the conventional precoding techniques for multiple confidential message transmissions in terms of network secrecy rate. Furthermore, we have also discussed a transmission strategy for the worst case scenarios where all unintended users are treated as colluding eavesdroppers. The simulations confirm the validity of the analysis results and provide additional information on the network performance in general cases.
