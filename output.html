<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The security of the Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted much attention due
to the growing number of IoT-oriented security incidents. IoT hardware and
software security vulnerabilities are exploited affecting many companies and
persons. Since the causes of vulnerabilities go beyond pure technical measures,
there is a pressing demand nowadays to demystify IoT "security complex" and
develop practical guidelines for both companies, consumers, and regulators. In
this paper, we present an initial study targeting an unexplored sphere in IoT
by illuminating the potential of crowdsource ethical hacking approaches for
enhancing IoT vulnerability management. We focus on Bug Bounty Programs (BBP)
and Responsible Disclosure (RD), which stimulate hackers to report
vulnerability in exchange for monetary rewards. We carried out a qualitative
investigation supported by literature survey and expert interviews to explore
how BBP and RD can facilitate the practice of identifying, classifying,
prioritizing, remediating, and mitigating IoT vulnerabilities in an effective
and cost-efficient manner. Besides deriving tangible guidelines for IoT
stakeholders, our study also sheds light on a systematic integration path to
combine BBP and RD with existing security practices (e.g., penetration test) to
further boost overall IoT security.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The supposed hardness of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem is
crucial for modern cryptographic protocols. In 2018, the article
"Quasi-subfield polynomials and the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem"
by Huang et al. highlighted the potential of a specific class of polynomials to
solve this problem at lower cost. Following different tracks that were
mentioned in this article, we were able to prove new results: we have exhibited
and proved five more families of quasi-subfield polynomials. They are based on
additive groups and multiplicative groups. Nonetheless, none of the found
families allows us to beat already known ECDLP algorithms. We explained this
obstruction in the case of linearized polynomials by proving a new tight lower
bound. Finally, we briefly discuss how other algebraic groups could be used in
this context.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we explore vulnerabilities and countermeasures of the recently
proposed blockchain consensus based on proof-of-authority. The proof-of-work
blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, have been shown both theoretically and
empirically vulnerable to double spending attacks. This is why Byzantine fault
tolerant consensus algorithms have gained popularity in the blockchain context
for their ability to tolerate a limited number t of attackers among n
participants. We formalize the recently proposed proof-of-authority consensus
algorithms that are Byzantine fault tolerant by describing the Aura and Clique
protocols present in the two mainstream implementations of Ethereum. We then
introduce the Cloning Attack and show how to apply it to double spend in each
of these protocols with a single malicious node. Our results show that the
Cloning Attack against Aura is always successful while the same attack against
Clique is about twice as fast and succeeds in most cases.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We revisit the problem of differentially private release of classification
queries. In this problem, the goal is to design an algorithm that can
accurately answer a sequence of classification queries based on a private
training set while ensuring differential privacy. We formally study this
problem in the agnostic PAC model and derive a new upper bound on the private
sample complexity. Our results improve over those obtained in a recent work
[BTT18] for the agnostic PAC setting. In particular, we give an improved
construction that yields a tighter upper bound on the sample complexity.
Moreover, unlike [BTT18], our accuracy guarantee does not involve any blow-up
in the approximation error associated with the given hypothesis class.
</p>
<p>Given any hypothesis class with VC-dimension $d$, we show that our
construction can privately answer up to $m$ classification queries with average
excess error $\alpha$ using a private sample of size $\approx
\frac{d}{\alpha^2}\,\max\left(1, \sqrt{m}\,\alpha^{3/2}\right)$. Using recent
results on private learning with auxiliary public data, we extend our
construction to show that one can privately answer any number of classification
queries with average excess error $\alpha$ using a private sample of size
$\approx \frac{d}{\alpha^2}\,\max\left(1, \sqrt{d}\,\alpha\right)$. When
$\alpha=O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}\right)$, our private sample complexity bound
is essentially optimal.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we aim to understand the generalization properties of
generative adversarial networks (GANs) from a new perspective of privacy
protection. Theoretically, we prove that a differentially private learning
algorithm used for training the GAN does not overfit to a certain degree, i.e.,
the generalization gap can be bounded. Moreover, some recent works, such as the
Bayesian GAN, can be re-interpreted based on our theoretical insight from
privacy protection. Quantitatively, to evaluate the information leakage of
well-trained GAN models, we perform various membership attacks on these models.
The results show that previous Lipschitz regularization techniques are
effective in not only reducing the generalization gap but also alleviating the
information leakage of the training dataset.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To the Editor In their prospective cohort study, Dr Chan and colleagues found that among adults undergoing major noncardiac surgery, unrecognized severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was significantly associated with increased postoperative cardiovascular complications, including cardiac death. These results are supported by observational research indicating a higher risk of postoperative cardiac complications in patients with sleep apnea. However, other data indicate lower postoperative mortality rates in patients with diagnosed sleep apnea compared with patients without sleep apnea. Some researchers have speculated that the intermittent chronic hypoxia seen in OSA may lead to cardioprotective effects after surgery through ischemic preconditioning.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fault diagnosis of a thermal system under varying operating conditions is of great importance for the safe and reliable operation of a power plant involved in peak shaving. However, it is a difficult task due to the lack of sufficient labeled data under some operating conditions. In practical applications, the model built on the labeled data under one operating condition will be extended to such operating conditions. Data distribution discrepancy can be triggered by variation of operating conditions and may degenerate the performance of the model. Considering the fact that data distributions are different but related under different operating conditions, this paper proposes a hierarchical deep domain adaptation (HDDA) approach to transfer a classifier trained on labeled data under one loading condition to identify faults with unlabeled data under another loading condition. In HDDA, a hierarchical structure is developed to reveal the effective information for final diagnosis by layerwisely capturing representative features. HDDA learns domain-invariant and discriminative features with the hierarchical structure by reducing distribution discrepancy and preserving discriminative information hidden in raw process data. For practical applications, the Taguchi method is used to obtain the optimized model parameters. Experimental results and comprehensive comparison analysis demonstrate its superiority.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a distributed fixed-time multiagent control strategy for the frequency restoration, voltage regulation, state of charge balancing, and proportional reactive power sharing between photovoltaic battery systems distributed in a microgrid with communication time delays. First, the feedback linearization method is applied to find the direct relationships between explicit states and control inputs. Then, based on the model, the distributed fixed-time cooperative control system restores the frequency, regulates the average voltage to the nominal value, and achieves accurate power sharing. For the state of charge balancing, a fixed-time observer is proposed to estimate the average state of charge of a battery using only information from neighbors. Based on the estimated value, a local fixed-time sliding mode control is applied to achieve the balanced state of charge. Due to robustness of the fixed-time control strategy, the balanced state of charge can be maintained despite intermittent photovoltaic generation and variable loads. The Artstein&#x0027;s transformation is applied to ensure the stability of the time delayed system. The dynamic performance is verified with an RTDS Technologies real-time digital simulator, using switching converter models, nonlinear lead-acid battery models, photovoltaic generation, and communication delays in a European benchmark microgrid.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A variable-gain finite-time convergent and noise-enduring zeroing neural network (VGFTNE-ZNN) is for the first time proposed for time-variant convex quadratic programming (QP). Differing from the existing finite-time convergent ZNNs with constant or variable design gains (i.e., CGFT-ZNN and VGFT-ZNN) that have limited noise-handling capabilities, the proposed VGFTNE-ZNN can endure additive noises by dynamically adjusting its design gains in finite time. Design gains of the unpolluted VGFTNE-ZNN are allowed to be constant when the QP problem is solved, whereas the design gain of the existing unpolluted VGFT-ZNN unrealistically increases to infinity when time evolves to infinity. Unlike existing polluted ZNNs with known noises involved, more practical unknown noises are successfully handled by the VGFTNE-ZNN. The finite-time convergence and noise-endurance properties of the VGFTNE-ZNN are mathematically proved based on the Lyapunov theory. Numerical verifications are comparatively performed with the superiorities of the VGFTNE-ZNN substantiated as compared with the existing CGFT-ZNN and VGFT-ZNN.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Forecasting spot prices of electricity is challenging because it not only contains seasonal variations, but also random, abrupt spikes, which depend on market conditions and network contingencies. In this paper, a hybrid model has been developed to forecast the spot prices of electricity in two main stages. In the first stage, the prices are forecasted using autoregressive time varying (ARXTV) model with exogenous variables. To improve the forecasting ability of the ARXTV model, the price variations in the training process have been smoothened using the wavelet technique. In the second stage, a kernel regression is used to estimate the price spikes, which are detected using support vector machine based model. In addition, mutual information technique is employed to select appropriate input variables for the model. A case study is carried out with the aid of price data obtained from the Australian energy market operator. It is demonstrated that the proposed hybrid method can accurately forecast electricity prices containing spikes.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Current imbalance in multistring light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is a critical issue. It may cause overcurrent in one or more LED strings, leading to rapid degradation. In this paper, a mixed high-order compensation networks-based wireless power transfer system is proposed to generate multiple constant current outputs. It is composed of an LCC resonant network in the transmitting side, a series resonant network, and multiple CLC resonant rectifiers in the receiving side. The CLC resonant rectifiers are connected in parallel to form multiple independent output channels, and each channel is then connected to an LED string. Based on the analysis of the T resonant circuit and the modeling of coupling coils, multiple constant output currents can be derived. As a result, current balance can be achieved, which is very suitable for driving multistring LEDs. The proposed system also offers a modular, scalable, and maintenance-free design, which can significantly reduce the construction cost and the control complexity. In addition, the inverter in the transmitting side can achieve zero phase angle. A laboratory prototype with dual independent output currents is built to verify the proposed method. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical analysis.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Failure of the commutation process is a serious malfunction in line-commutated high-voltage direct current (HVdc) converters, which mainly occurs due to inverter ac faults and may lead to outage of the HVdc system. In this paper, an improved strategy is developed that functions based on the SIEMENS HVdc control system under normal conditions and switches to a designed commutation failure inhibition module (CFIM) during an inverter ac fault. From the response speed point of view, since the designed CFIM does not require any proportional-integral controller, the inverter control system has a quick performance in prevention of the commutation failure. This is achieved by direct measurement of the overlap area using the waveforms of the valves anode&#x2013;cathode and commuting voltages. In addition, from the accuracy aspect, the proposed method has a superior performance in comparison with the existing strategies. It is because of the fact that by direct measurement of the overlap area, variations of both direct current and the commutation inductance are considered, and hence, the unnecessary increase of the inverter reactive power consumption during the fault and the repetitive commutation failures are prevented. The practical performance and feasibility of the proposed strategy is validated through the laboratory testing, using the real-time Opal-RT hardware prototyping platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can effectively inhibit the commutation failure or repetitive commutation failures under different fault types by considering the lowest possible reactive power consumption.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems have been widely used to meet the emission regulations and two-cell SCR systems have shown the advantages of high NO$_{x}$ conversion efficiency and low NH$_{3}$ slip simultaneously. However, it is noteworthy that the catalyst performance of SCR device would degrade over the service time gradually. If the performance degrading is not well-compensated, the NO$_{x}$ conversion efficiency would reduce significantly. Different from detecting the aging issue in the laboratory, a practical method is to design an observer to estimate the aging factor online such that the urea injection can be modified accordingly. In this paper, we aim to construct an aging-factor observer for two-cell SCR systems. In order to reduce the algorithm computational load and guarantee the implementation performance, we propose a dual time-scale algorithm based on two-cell SCR model and unscented Kalman filter. There is a fast time scale and a slow time scale in the algorithm. Two simulation studies of constant aging factor and time-varying aging factor are investigated in the simulation environment of MATLAB/SIMULINK. The simulation results indicate that the proposed dual time-scale observer works well under different conditions and the calculational load is reduced significantly.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a cable-driven exoskeleton device is developed for stroke patients to enable them to perform passive range of motion exercises and teleoperation rehabilitation of their impaired hands. Each exoskeleton finger is controlled by an actuator via two cables. The motions between the metacarpophalangeal and distal&#x002f;proximal interphalangeal joints are decoupled, through which the movement pattern is analogous to that observed in the human hand. A dynamic model based on the Lagrange method is derived to estimate how cable tension varies with the angular position of the finger joints. Two discernable phases are observed, each of which reflects the motion of the metacarpophalangeal and distal&#x002f;proximal interphalangeal joints. The tension profiles of exoskeleton fingers predicted by the Lagrange model are verified through a mechatronic integrated platform. The model can precisely estimate the tensions at different movement velocities, and it shows that the characteristics of two independent phases remain the same even for a variety of movement velocities. The feasibility for measuring resistance when manipulating a patient&#x0027;s finger is demonstrated in human experiments. Specifically, the net force required to move a subject&#x0027;s finger joints can be accounted for by the Lagrange model.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In a typical communication pipeline, images undergo a series of processing steps that can cause visual distortions before being viewed. Given a high quality reference image, a reference (R) image quality assessment (IQA) algorithm can be applied after compression or transmission. However, the assumption of a high quality reference image is often not fulfilled in practice, thus contributing to less accurate quality predictions when using stand-alone R IQA models. This is particularly common on social media, where hundreds of billions of user-generated photos and videos containing diverse, mixed distortions are uploaded, compressed, and shared annually on sites like Facebook, YouTube, and Snapchat. The qualities of the pictures that are uploaded to these sites vary over a very wide range. While this is an extremely common situation, the problem of assessing the qualities of compressed images against their pre-compressed, but often severely distorted (reference) pictures has been little studied. Towards ameliorating this problem, we propose a novel two-step image quality prediction concept that combines NR with R quality measurements. Applying a first stage of NR IQA to determine the possibly degraded quality of the source image yields information that can be used to quality-modulate the R prediction to improve its accuracy. We devise a simple and efficient weighted product model of R and NR stages, which combines a pre-compression NR measurement with a post-compression R measurement. This first-of-a-kind two-step approach produces more reliable objective prediction scores. We also constructed a new, first-of-a-kind dedicated database specialized for the design and testing of two-step IQA models. Using this new resource, we show that two-step approaches yield outstanding performance when applied to compressed images whose original, pre-compression quality covers a wide range of realistic distortion types and severities. The two-step concept is versatile as it can use -
ny desired R and NR components. We are making the source code of a particularly efficient model that we call 2stepQA publicly available at https://github.com/xiangxuyu/2stepQA. We are also providing the dedicated new two-step database free of charge at http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/twostep/index.html.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Image representation methods based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved the state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision tasks, such as image retrieval and person re-identification. We recognize that more discriminative feature embeddings can be learned with supervised deep metric learning and handcrafted features for image retrieval and similar applications. In this paper, we propose a new supervised deep feature embedding with a handcrafted feature model. To fuse handcrafted feature information into CNNs and realize feature embeddings, a general fusion unit is proposed (called Fusion-Net). We also define a network loss function with image label information to realize supervised deep metric learning. Our extensive experimental results on the Stanford online products&#x2019; data set and the in-shop clothes retrieval data set demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform the existing state-of-the-art methods of image retrieval by a large margin. Moreover, we also explore the applications of the proposed methods in person re-identification and vehicle re-identification; the experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Unpaired image-to-image translation problem aims to model the mapping from one domain to another with unpaired training data. Current works like the well-acknowledged Cycle GAN provide a general solution for any two domains through modeling injective mappings with a symmetric structure. While in situations where two domains are asymmetric in complexity, i.e., the amount of information between two domains is different, these approaches pose problems of poor generation quality, mapping ambiguity, and model sensitivity. To address these issues, we propose Asymmetric GAN (AsymGAN) to adapt the asymmetric domains by introducing an auxiliary variable (aux) to learn the extra information for transferring from the information-poor domain to the information-rich domain, which improves the performance of state-of-the-art approaches in the following ways. First, aux better balances the information between two domains which benefits the quality of generation. Second, the imbalance of information commonly leads to mapping ambiguity, where we are able to model one-to-many mappings by tuning aux, and furthermore, our aux is controllable. Third, the training of Cycle GAN can easily make the generator pair sensitive to small disturbances and variations while our model decouples the ill-conditioned relevance of generators by injecting aux during training. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed method both qualitatively and quantitatively on asymmetric situation, label-photo task, on Cityscapes and Helen datasets, and show many applications of asymmetric image translations. In conclusion, our AsymGAN provides a better solution for unpaired image-to-image translation in asymmetric domains.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we focus on restoring high-resolution facial images under noisy low-resolution scenarios. This problem is a challenging problem as the most important structures and details of captured facial images are missing. To address this problem, we propose a novel local patch-based face super-resolution (FSR) method via the joint learning of the contextual model. The contextual model is based on the topology consisting of contextual sub-patches, which provide more useful structural information than the commonly used local contextual structures due to the finer patch size. In this way, the contextual models are able to recover the missing local structures in target patches. In order to further strengthen the structural compensation function of contextual topology, we introduce the recognition feature as additional regularity. Based on the contextual model, we formulate the super-resolved procedure as a contextual joint representation with respect to the target patch and its adjacent patches. The high-resolution image is obtained by weighting contextual estimations. Both quantitative and qualitative validations show that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Highly secure access control requires Swiss-cheese-type multi-layer security protocols. The use of electroencephalogram (EEG) to provide cognitive indicators for human workload and fatigue has created environments where the EEG data are well-integrated into systems, making it readily available for more forms of innovative uses including biometrics. However, most of the existing studies on EEG biometrics rely on resting state signals or require specific and repetitive sensory stimulation, limiting their uses in naturalistic settings. Moreover, the limited discriminatory power of uni-variate measures denies an opportunity to use dependences information inherent in brain regions to design more robust biometric identifiers. In this paper, we proposed a novel model for ongoing EEG biometric identification using EEG collected during a diverse set of tasks. The novelty lies in representing EEG signals as a graph based on within-frequency and cross-frequency functional connectivity estimates, and the use of graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) to automatically capture deep intrinsic structural representations from the EEG graphs for person identification. An extensive investigation was carried out to assess the robustness of the method against diverse human states, including resting states under eye-open and eye-closed conditions and active states drawn during the performance of four different tasks. We compared our method with the state-of-the-art EEG features, classifiers, and models of EEG biometrics. Results show that the representation drawn from EEG functional connectivity graphs demonstrates more robust biometric traits than direct use of uni-variate features. Moreover, the GCNN can effectively and efficiently capture discriminative traits, thus generalizing better over diverse human states.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To contest the rapidly developing cyber-attacks, numerous collaborative security schemes, in which multiple security entities can exchange their observations and other relevant data to achieve more effective security decisions, are proposed and developed in the literature. However, the security-related information shared among the security entities may contain some sensitive information and such information exchange can raise privacy concerns, especially when these entities belong to different organizations. With such consideration, the interplay between the attacker and the collaborative entities is formulated as Quantitative Information Flow (QIF) games, in which the QIF theory is adapted to measure the collaboration gain and the privacy loss of the entities in the information sharing process. In particular, three games are considered, each corresponding to one possible scenario of interest in practice. Based on the game-theoretic analysis, the expected behaviors of both the attacker and the security entities are obtained. In addition, the simulation results are presented to validate the analysis.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The electroencephalography (EEG) method has recently attracted increasing attention in the study of brain activity-based biometric systems because of its simplicity, portability, noninvasiveness, and relatively low cost. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG, most of the existing EEG-based biometric systems require a long duration of signals to achieve high accuracy in individual identification. Besides, the feasibility and stability of these systems have not yet been conclusively reported, since most studies did not perform longitudinal evaluation. In this paper, we proposed a novel EEG-based individual identification method using code-modulated visualevoked potentials (c-VEPs). Specifically, this paper quantitatively compared eight code-modulated stimulation patterns, including six 63-bit (1.05 s at 60-Hz refresh rate) m-sequences (M1-M6) and two spatially combined sequence groups (M&#x00d7;4: M1-M4 and M&#x00d7; 6: M1-M6) in recording the c-VEPs from a group of 25 subjects for individual identification. To further evaluate the influence of inter-session variability, we recorded two data sessions for each individual on different days to measure intra-session and cross-session identification performance. State-of-the-art VEP detection algorithms in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) were employed to construct a template-matching-based identification framework. For intra-session identification, we achieved a 100% correct recognition rate (CRR) using 5.25-s EEG data (average of five trials for M5). For cross-session identification, 99.43% CRR was attained using 10.5-s EEG signals (average of ten trials for M5). These results suggest that the proposed c-VEP based individual identification method is promising for real-world applications.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>At present, the fusion of different unimodal biometrics has attracted increasing attention from researchers, who are dedicated to the practical application of biometrics. In this paper, we explored a multi-biometric algorithm that integrates palmprints and dorsal hand veins (DHV). Palmprint recognition has a rather high accuracy and reliability, and the most significant advantage of DHV recognition is the biopsy (Liveness detection). In order to combine the advantages of both and implement the fusion method, deep learning and graph matching were, respectively, introduced to identify palmprint and DHV. Upon using the deep hashing network (DHN), biometric images can be encoded as 128-bit codes. Then, the Hamming distances were used to represent the similarity of two codes. Biometric graph matching (BGM) can obtain three discriminative features for classification. In order to improve the accuracy of open-set recognition, in multi-modal fusion, the score-level fusion of DHN and BGM was performed and authentication was provided by support vector machine (SVM). Furthermore, based on DHN, all four levels of fusion strategies were used for multi-modal recognition of palmprint and DHV. Evaluation experiments and comprehensive comparisons were conducted on various commonly used datasets, and the promising results were obtained in this case where the equal error rates (EERs) of both palmprint recognition and multi-biometrics equal 0, demonstrating the great superiority of DHN in biometric verification.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Touchless palmprint recognition systems enable high-accuracy recognition of individuals through less-constrained and highly usable procedures that do not require the contact of the palm with a surface. To perform this recognition, methods based on local texture descriptors and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are currently used to extract highly discriminative features while compensating for variations in scale, rotation, and illumination in biometric samples. In particular, the main advantage of CNN-based methods is their ability to adapt to biometric samples captured with heterogeneous devices. However, the current methods rely on either supervised training algorithms, which require class labels (e.g., the identities of the individuals) during the training phase, or filters pretrained on general-purpose databases, which may not be specifically suitable for palmprint data. To achieve a high-recognition accuracy with touchless palmprint samples captured using different devices while neither requiring class labels for training nor using pretrained filters, we introduce PalmNet, which is a novel CNN that uses a newly developed method to tune palmprint-specific filters through an unsupervised procedure based on Gabor responses and principal component analysis (PCA), not requiring class labels during training. PalmNet is a new method of applying Gabor filters in a CNN and is designed to extract highly discriminative palmprint-specific descriptors and to adapt to heterogeneous databases. We validated the innovative PalmNet on several palmprint databases captured using different touchless acquisition procedures and heterogeneous devices, and in all cases, a recognition accuracy greater than that of the current methods in this paper was obtained.
