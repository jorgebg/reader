<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Database users have started moving toward the use of cloud computing as a
service because it provides computation and storage needs at affordable prices.
However, for most of the users, the concern of privacy plays a major role as
they cannot control data access once their data are outsourced, especially if
the cloud provider is curious about their data. Data encryption is an effective
way to solve privacy concerns, but executing queries over encrypted data is a
problem that needs attention. In this research, we introduce a bit-based model
to execute different relational algebra operators over encrypted databases at
the cloud without decrypting the data. To encrypt data, we use the randomized
encryption algorithm (Advanced Encryption Standard-CBC) to provide the
maximum-security level. The idea is based on classifying attributes as
sensitive and non-sensitive, where only sensitive attributes are encrypted. For
each sensitive attribute, the table owner predefined the possible partition
domains on which the tuples will be encoded into bit vectors before the
encryption. We store the bit vectors in an additional column(s) in the
encrypted table in the cloud. We use those bits to retrieve only part of
encrypted records that are candidates for a specific query. We implemented and
evaluated our model and found that the proposed model is practical and success
to minimize the range of the retrieved encrypted records to less than 30
percent of the whole set of encrypted records in a table.

<p>Transfer learning, that transfer the learned knowledge of pre-trained Teacher
models over large datasets via fine-tuning, provides an effective solution for
feasibly and fast customize accurate Student models. Many pre-trained Teacher
models are publicly available and maintained by public platforms, increasing
their vulnerability to backdoor attacks. In this paper, we demonstrate a
backdoor threat to transfer learning tasks on both image and time-series data
leveraging the knowledge of publicly accessible Teacher models, aimed at
defeating three commonly-adopted defenses: pruning-based, retraining-based and
input pre-processing-based defenses. Specifically, (A) ranking-based selection
mechanism to speed up the backdoor trigger generation and perturbation process
while defeating pruning-based and/or retraining-based defenses. (B)
autoencoder-powered trigger generation is proposed to produce a robust trigger
that can defeat the input pre-processing-based defense, while guaranteeing that
selected neuron(s) can be significantly activated. (C) defense-aware retraining
to generate the manipulated model using reverse-engineered model inputs. We use
the real-world image and bioelectric signal analytics applications to
demonstrate the power of our attack and conduct a comprehensive empirical
analysis of the possible factors that affect the attack. The
efficiency/effectiveness and feasibility/easiness of such attacks are validated
by empirically evaluating the state-of-the-art image, Electroencephalography
(EEG) and Electrocardiography (ECG) learning systems.

<p>In this work, we propose a study on the use of post-quantum cryptographic
primitives for the Tor network in order to make it safe in a quantum world.
With this aim, the underlying keying material has first been analysed. We
observe that breaking the security of the algorithms/protocols that use long-
and medium-term keys (usually RSA keys) have the highest impact in security.
Therefore, we investigate the cost of quantum-safe variants. These include key
generation, key encapsulation and decapsulation. Six different post-quantum
cryptographic algorithms that ensure level 1 NIST security are evaluated. We
further target the Tor circuit creation operation and evaluate the overhead of
the post-quantum variant. This comparative study is performed through a
reference implementation based on SweetOnions that simulates Tor with slight
simplifications. We show that a quantum-safe Tor circuit creation is possible
and suggest two versions - one that can be used in a purely quantum-safe
setting, and one that can be used in a hybrid setting.

<p>Verification of neural networks enables us to gauge their robustness against
adversarial attacks. Verification algorithms fall into two categories: exact
verifiers that run in exponential time and relaxed verifiers that are efficient
but incomplete. In this paper, we unify all existing LP-relaxed verifiers, to
the best of our knowledge, under a general convex relaxation framework. This
framework works for neural networks with diverse architectures and
nonlinearities and covers both primal and dual views of robustness
verification. We further prove strong duality between the primal and dual
problems under very mild conditions. Next, we perform large-scale experiments,
amounting to more than 22 CPU-years, to obtain exact solution to the
convex-relaxed problem that is optimal within our framework for ReLU networks.
We find the exact solution does not significantly improve upon the gap between
PGD and existing relaxed verifiers for various networks trained normally or
robustly on MNIST and CIFAR datasets. Our results suggest there is an inherent
barrier to tight verification for the large class of methods captured by our
framework. We discuss possible causes of this barrier and potential future
directions for bypassing it. Our code and trained models are available at

<p>Smart contracts are software programs featuring both traditional applications
and distributed data storage on blockchains. Ethereum is a prominent blockchain
platform with the support of smart contracts. The smart contracts act as
autonomous agents in critical decentralized applications and hold a significant
amount of cryptocurrency to perform trusted transactions and agreements.
Millions of dollars as part of the assets held by the smart contracts were
stolen or frozen through the notorious attacks just between 2016 and 2018, such
as the DAO attack, Parity Multi-Sig Wallet attack, and the integer
underflow/overflow attacks. These attacks were caused by a combination of
technical flaws in designing and implementing software codes. However, many
more vulnerabilities of less severity are to be discovered because of the
scripting natures of the Solidity language and the non-updateable feature of
blockchains. Hence, we surveyed 16 security vulnerabilities in smart contract
programs, and some vulnerabilities do not have a proper solution. This survey
aims to identify the key vulnerabilities in smart contracts on Ethereum in the
perspectives of their internal mechanisms and software security
vulnerabilities. By correlating 16 Ethereum vulnerabilities and 19 software
security issues, we predict that many attacks are yet to be exploited. And we
have explored many software tools to detect the security vulnerabilities of
smart contracts in terms of static analysis, dynamic analysis, and formal
verification. This survey presents the security problems in smart contracts
together with the available analysis tools and the detection methods. We also
investigated the limitations of the tools or analysis methods with respect to
the identified security vulnerabilities of the smart contracts.

<p>We study the trade-off between secret message (SM) and secret key (SK) rates, simultaneously achievable over a state-dependent (SD) wiretap channel (WTC) with non-causal channel state information (CSI) at the encoder. This model subsumes other instances of CSI availability as special cases, and calls for efficient utilization of the state sequence for both reliability and security purposes. An inner bound on the semantic-security (SS) SM-SK capacity region is derived based on a superposition coding scheme inspired by a past work of the authors. The region is shown to attain capacity for a certain class of SD-WTCs. SS is established by virtue of two versions of the strong soft-covering lemma. The derived region yields an improvement upon the previously best known SM-SK trade-off result reported by Prabhakaran et al., and, to the best of our knowledge, upon all other existing lower bounds for either SM or SK for this setup, even if the semantic security requirement is relaxed to weak secrecy. It is demonstrated that our region can be strictly larger than those reported in the preceding works.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper addresses the problem of sensor selection in a sensor network for tracking a moving target. By considering network uncertainties and unpredictable movements of the target, reliable sensor selection approaches such as sigma points probability and target trajectory are proposed. An updated unscented Kalman filter is proposed to achieve effective tracking of the target through the sensor selection. A multialgorithm genetically adaptive multiobjective is utilized to have a selection strategy without knowing the number of sensors to be selected. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach both in simulation and practical experimentation. The proposed algorithm is also tested in the industrial setting where providing safety is of great importance for a human worker who walks in a potentially dangerous workplace. The results confirm the effectiveness and utility of the proposed scheme.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the position synchronization control problem for networked multiaxis motion systems (NMAMSs). First, a position synchronization error model is established for the multiaxis motion system, and the uncertainty induced by the network-induced delay is modeled as an additive disturbance of the system. Second, the delay-induced uncertainty and the external disturbances such as load torque variation are lumped together as a total disturbance in the system model. Based on the established position synchronization error model, a generalized extended state observer (GESO) is designed to estimate the lumped disturbance and system states simultaneously. Then, the GESO-based synchronization controller is designed to achieve the objective of position synchronization and disturbance rejection, and the effect of the network-induced delay in the synchronization performance is significantly reduced. Moreover, an input-to-state stability condition is presented for the position synchronization system. Finally, experiments on a four-motors position synchronization control platform are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The mission abort is an effective action to reduce the risk of casualties and enhance the survivability of mission-based systems such as aircrafts, submarines, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A main task in real operations is to strive for balance between the mission reliability and the system survivability via elaborate mission abort plans. In this paper, we design the optimal mission abort policies based on the information of early-warning signals, which indicates the possible forthcoming fatal malfunction. Depending on the acquisition time of such information, the operator may immediately abort the mission, or ignore the information and continue the task. Within the framework of a constant mission duration, we carry out an economic analysis for the above problem. The optimal abort decision that minimizes the expected total economic loss is investigated. We further extend the proposed model to the scenario of a random mission duration and derive the corresponding optimal abort decisions. A case study on a UAV executing power-grid inspection missions is used to illustrate the applicability of the abort policies.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents the use of automated machine learning for solving a practical problem of a real-life Smart Waste Management system. In particular, the focus of the paper is on the problem of detection (i.e., binary classification) of emptying of a recycling container using sensor measurements. Numerous data-driven methods for solving the problem are investigated in a realistic setting where most of the events are not actual emptying. The investigated methods include the existing manually engineered model and its modification as well as conventional machines learning algorithms. The use of machine learning allows improving the classification accuracy and recall of the existing manually engineered model from $86.8%$ and $47.9%$ to $99.1%$ and $98.2%$, respectively, when using the best performing solution. This solution uses a Random Forest classifier on a set of features based on the filling level at different given time spans. Finally, compared to the baseline existing manually engineered model, the best performing solution also improves the quality of forecasts for emptying time of recycling containers.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In the era of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), huge amounts of data are generated, and companies are highly motivated to store the data on cloud servers for cost saving and efficient application. However, the IIoT data are always of great value. The direct outsourcing of such data can leak the important information of the companies and cause great business losses. A straightforward solution is to encrypt the data by using standard encryption methods before outsourcing. Nevertheless, this will make data utilization quite inconvenient. This paper focuses on the secure process of image data on cloud servers. Images are stored on cloud servers in encrypted form, and the local binary pattern feature can be directly extracted from the encrypted images for applications. The security analysis and experimental results demonstrate the security and effectiveness of our scheme.

<p>To the Editor I agree with Dr Ratzan that any grounding in the humanities in the premed years, before going on to the sciences, is a good way for physicians to learn how to deal with the emotional and social difficulties that many of their patients with physical or emotional problems experience. Applying empathy and compassion at times is more difficult for physicians than prescribing a medicine or performing a surgical procedure.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To the Editor Dr Burt and colleagues concluded that treatment of healthy adults with high-dose vitamin D supplementation for 3 years did not have any beneficial effects on volumetric bone mineral density (BMD) and bone strength. Although these results appear similar to findings that disputed the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation in the general population, we emphasize that these results should not be generalized. The baseline mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations in the 3 groups randomized to different doses of supplementation ranged from 76.7 to 81.3 nmol/L, considerably higher than currently accepted thresholds for diagnosing vitamin D deficiency (&#8804;50 nmol/L) and insufficiency (&#8804;75 nmol/L). Although participants with serum 25(OH)D concentrations less than 30 nmol/L were excluded from the study, it cannot be concluded that those with serum 25(OH)D values between 30 and 75 nmol/L would have responded more favorably to high-dose vitamin D supplementation in terms of volumetric BMD and bone strength. We believe that a further subanalysis of these patients might be advisable.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Women have used powders for genital hygiene for decades to absorb odor and moisture. While rates of powder use in the genital area have declined over the last 50 years, it remains a routine practice for some women. Commonly used products typically include talc, cornstarch, or some combination of both. Women may apply powders directly to the perineum or onto sanitary napkins, tampons, diaphragms, or underwear. Investigations of an association between the use of talc-containing powders for genital hygiene and epithelial ovarian cancer risks have provided inconsistent results to date and resulted in ongoing controversy. Since 1971, peer-reviewed articles have documented the possible association between talc use and the development of ovarian cancer. However, a PubMed search covering the last 5 decades identified only 17 primary or secondary studies and 36 other articles that were reviews, commentaries, meta-analyses, or letters to the editor. In short, while some investigations have been reported, the majority of publications were opinion and discussion articles.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Connected Components Labeling is an essential step of many Image Processing and Computer Vision tasks. Since the first proposal of a labeling algorithm, which dates back to the sixties, many approaches have optimized the computational load needed to label an image. In particular, the use of decision forests and state prediction have recently appeared as valuable strategies to improve performance. However, due to the overhead of the manual construction of prediction states and the size of the resulting machine code, the application of these strategies has been restricted to small masks, thus ignoring the benefit of using a block-based approach. In this paper, we combine a block-based mask with state prediction and code compression: the resulting algorithm is modeled as a Directed Rooted Acyclic Graph with multiple entry points, which is automatically generated without manual intervention. When tested on synthetic and real datasets, in comparison with optimized implementations of state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed approach shows superior performance, surpassing the results obtained by all compared approaches in all settings.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims at matching person images captured in non-overlapping camera views. To represent person appearance, low-level visual features are sensitive to environmental changes, while high-level semantic attributes, such as &#x201c;short-hair&#x201d; or &#x201c;long-hair&#x201d;, are relatively stable. Hence, researches have started to design semantic attributes to reduce the visual ambiguity. However, to train a prediction model for semantic attributes, it requires plenty of annotations, which are hard to obtain in practical large-scale applications. To alleviate the reliance on annotation efforts, we propose to incrementally generate Deep Hidden Attribute (DHA) based on baseline deep network for newly uncovered annotations. In particular, we propose an auto-encoder model that can be plugged into any deep network to mine latent information in an unsupervised manner. To optimize the effectiveness of DHA, we reform the auto-encoder model with additional orthogonal generation module, along with identity-preserving and sparsity constraints. 1) Orthogonally generating: In order to make DHAs different from each other, Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD) is introduced to generate DHAs orthogonally. 2) Identity-preserving constraint: The generated DHAs should be distinct for telling different persons, so we associate DHAs with person identities. 3) Sparsity constraint: To enhance the discriminability of DHAs, we also introduce the sparsity constraint to restrict the number of effective DHAs for each person. Experiments conducted on public datasets have validated the effectiveness of the proposed network. On two large-scale datasets, i.e., Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Tone Mapping Operators (TMO) designed for videos can be classified into two categories. In a first approach, TMOs are temporal filtered to reduce temporal artifacts and provide a Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) content with improved temporal consistency. This however does not improve the SDR coding Rate Distortion (RD) performances. A second approach is to design the TMO with the goal of optimizing the SDR coding rate-distortion performances. This second category of methods may lead to SDR videos altering the artistic intent compared with the produced HDR content. In this paper, we combine the benefits of the two approaches by introducing new Weighted Prediction (WP) methods inside the HEVC SDR codec. As a first step, we demonstrate the interest of the WP methods compared to TMO optimized for RD performances. Then we present the newly introduced WP algorithm and WP modes. The WP algorithm consists in performing a global motion compensation between frames using an optical flow, and the new modes are based on non linear functions in contrast with the literature using only linear functions. The contribution of each novelty is studied independently and in a second time they are all put in competition to maximize the RD performances. Tests were made for HDR backward compatible compression but also for SDR compression only. In both cases, the proposed WP methods improve the RD performances while maintaining the SDR temporal coherency.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper we address the problem of hallucinating high-resolution facial images from low-resolution inputs at high magnification factors. We approach this task with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and propose a novel (deep) face hallucination model that incorporates identity priors into the learning procedure. The model consists of two main parts: i) a cascaded super-resolution network that upscales the low-resolution facial images, and ii) an ensemble of face recognition models that act as identity priors for the super-resolution network during training. Different from most competing super-resolution techniques that rely on a single model for upscaling (even with large magnification factors), our network uses a cascade of multiple SR models that progressively upscale the low-resolution images using steps of  $2times $ . This characteristic allows us to apply supervision signals (target appearances) at different resolutions and incorporate identity constraints at multiple-scales. The proposed C-SRIP model (Cascaded Super Resolution with Identity Priors) is able to upscale (tiny) low-resolution images captured in unconstrained conditions and produce visually convincing results for diverse low-resolution inputs. We rigorously evaluate the proposed model on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW), Helen and CelebA datasets and report superior performance compared to the existing state-of-the-art.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Finding suitable image representations for the task at hand is critical in computer vision. Different approaches extending the original Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) model have recently been proposed to offer rotation-invariant feature learning. In this paper, we present an extended novel RBM that learns rotation invariant features by explicitly factorizing for rotation nuisance in 2D image inputs within an unsupervised framework. While the goal is to learn invariant features, our model infers an orientation per input image during training, using information related to the reconstruction error. The training process is regularised by a Kullback-Leibler divergence, offering stability and consistency. We used the  $gamma $ -score, a measure that calculates the amount of invariance, to mathematically and experimentally demonstrate that our approach indeed learns rotation invariant features. We show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art RBM approaches for rotation invariant feature learning on three different benchmark datasets, by measuring the performance with the test accuracy of an SVM classifier. Our implementation is available at https://bitbucket.org/tuttoweb/rotinvrbm.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>For high-speed permanent magnet machines (HSPMMs), the permanent magnet (PM) is more likely to suffer irreversible demagnetization because the heat dissipation is serious in the HSPMMs, especially for the high-power machines. This paper focuses on the comprehensive research results on the power loss and thermal characteristic for a high-power HSPMM. First, the power loss at the rated load is investigated by finite-element analysis. Then, the temperature distribution of four cooling schemes is compared by the electromagnetic-thermal iteration calculation. The effect of different parameters on thermal behavior is obtained to reduce rotor temperature, which includes an examination of the axial flow duct, cooling medium, sleeve thickness, and sleeve thermal conductivity. Finally, an improved loss separation method is employed to obtain the loss distribution from the measured total loss, and the comprehensive experiments are implemented based on one HSPMM prototype (800 kW, 15 000 rpm) to verify the related theoretical analysis.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The fast detection of magnitude, frequency, and phase angle of the fundamental-frequency component is very useful in many three-phase power system applications. Most techniques to accomplish this task are based on different versions of three-phase phase-locked loop (PLL) schemes. Some variables of three-phase systems may experience phase angle jumps after some disturbances. In this paper, a method for the fast detection of phase angle jump occurrence, estimation of the phase angle jump, and its use for improving the performance of the generalized delayed signal cancelation (GDSC) PLL is proposed. The proposed method is based on the detailed evaluation of the GDSC filter transient behavior after a phase jump. Results considering typical three-phase grid disturbances are used to evaluate the proposed scheme, in comparison with other usual PLL techniques. The use of the proposed phase jump angle estimator allowed a reduction in the GDSC-PLL convergence time of about 50&#x0025;.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, closed-loop control and boundary condition for continuous conduction mode and discontinuous conduction mode of nonisolated inverting N&#x00d7; multilevel boost converter (MBC) are articulated. Inverting N&#x00d7; MBC combines the features of classical boost converter and voltage multiplier to attain inverting N times higher voltage. Consequently, the inverting N&#x00d7; MBC provides a viable solution for high-voltage step-up photovoltaic applications with low voltage rating reactive components and semiconductor devices. The control strategy with saturation limiter is employed to achieve highly stable voltage. The modes of operation, benefits of inverting N&#x00d7; MBC, and key factors for the selection of semiconductor devices and sizing of the reactive components are discussed. Additionally, the effects of reactive components and semiconductor devices on the output voltage are examined. Experimental results of the developed circuit are presented to validate the design of converter, and effectiveness and robustness of the implemented control algorithm for different input and output side perturbations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Time delay control (TDC) is a promising technique for robot manipulators because it is model-free, efficient, and yet, robust. Nevertheless, when a robot operates under significant payload changes, it is difficult to achieve satisfactory performance with a constant gain. To cope with this problem, several adaptive rules have already been proposed thus far, but they are less effective to significant payload changes, and parameter tuning procedures are too complicated. In this paper, we propose an adaptive gain dynamics that is more effective in payload changes and yet simpler to implement. Through simulations using a one-link arm and experiments using a whole arm manipulator with payload changes, the proposed dynamics was compared with the conventional TDC and two other existing methods. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can adapt to significant payload changes, achieving better accuracy than the conventional TDC. Experimental results show that the proposed method has consistently better adaptation capability than other methods, achieving significantly better accuracy. In addition, the proposed method is simpler to implement, having only one tuning parameter, whereas the existing methods require four or five such tuning parameters.
