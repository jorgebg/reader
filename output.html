<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep Neural Network (DNN) workloads are quickly moving from datacenters onto
edge devices, for latency, privacy, or energy reasons. While datacenter
networks can be protected using conventional cybersecurity measures, edge
neural networks bring a host of new security challenges. Unlike classic IoT
applications, edge neural networks are typically very compute and memory
intensive, their execution is data-independent, and they are robust to noise
and faults. Neural network models may be very expensive to develop, and can
potentially reveal information about the private data they were trained on,
requiring special care in distribution. The hidden states and outputs of the
network can also be used in reconstructing user inputs, potentially violating
users' privacy. Furthermore, neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, which may cause misclassifications and violate the integrity of the
output. These properties add challenges when securing edge-deployed DNNs,
requiring new considerations, threat models, priorities, and approaches in
securely and privately deploying DNNs to the edge. In this work, we cover the
landscape of attacks on, and defenses, of neural networks deployed in edge
devices and provide a taxonomy of attacks and defenses targeting edge DNNs.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose to identify compromised mobile devices from a
network administrator's point of view. Intuitively, inadvertent users (and thus
their devices) who download apps through untrustworthy markets are often
allured to install malicious apps through in-app advertisement or phishing. We
thus hypothesize that devices sharing a similar set of apps will have a similar
probability of being compromised, resulting in the association between a device
being compromised and apps in the device. Our goal is to leverage such
associations to identify unknown compromised devices (i.e., devices possibly
having yet currently not having known malicious apps) using the
guilt-by-association principle. Admittedly, such associations could be quite
weak as it is often hard, if not impossible, for an app to automatically
download and install other apps without explicit initiation from a user. We
describe how we can magnify such weak associations between devices and apps by
carefully choosing parameters when applying graph-based inferences. We
empirically show the effectiveness of our approach with a comprehensive study
on the mobile network traffic provided by a major mobile service provider.
Concretely, we achieve nearly 98\% accuracy in terms of AUC (area under the ROC
curve). Given the relatively weak nature of association, we further conduct
in-depth analysis of the different behavior of a graph-inference approach, by
comparing it to active DNS data. Moreover, we validate our results by showing
that detected compromised devices indeed present undesirable behavior in terms
of their privacy leakage and network infrastructure accessed.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Mouse dynamics is a potential means of authenticating users. Typically, the
authentication process is based on classical machine learning techniques, but
recently, deep learning techniques have been introduced for this purpose.
Although prior research has demonstrated how machine learning and deep learning
algorithms can be bypassed by carefully crafted adversarial samples, there has
been very little research performed on the topic of behavioural biometrics in
the adversarial domain. In an attempt to address this gap, we built a set of
attacks, which are applications of several generative approaches, to construct
adversarial mouse trajectories that bypass authentication models. These
generated mouse sequences will serve as the adversarial samples in the context
of our experiments. We also present an analysis of the attack approaches we
explored, explaining their limitations. In contrast to previous work, we
consider the attacks in a more realistic and challenging setting in which an
attacker has access to recorded user data but does not have access to the
authentication model or its outputs. We explore three different attack
strategies: 1) statistics-based, 2) imitation-based, and 3) surrogate-based; we
show that they are able to evade the functionality of the authentication
models, thereby impacting their robustness adversely. We show that
imitation-based attacks often perform better than surrogate-based attacks,
unless, however, the attacker can guess the architecture of the authentication
model. In such cases, we propose a potential detection mechanism against
surrogate-based attacks.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>AI-synthesized face swapping videos, commonly known as the DeepFakes, have
become an emerging problem recently. Correspondingly, there is an increasing
interest in developing algorithms that can detect them. However, existing
dataset of DeepFake videos suffer from low visual quality and abundant
artifacts that do not reflect the reality of DeepFake videos circulated on the
Internet. In this work, we present a new DeepFake dataset, Celeb-DF, for the
development and evaluation of DeepFake detection algorithms. The Celeb-DF
dataset is generated using a refined synthesis algorithm that reduces the
visual artifacts observed in existing datasets. Based on the Celeb-DF dataset,
we also benchmark existing DeepFake detection algorithms.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the development of blockchain, the huge history data limits the
scalability of the blockchain. This paper proposes to downsample these data to
reduce the storage overhead of nodes. These nodes keep good independency, if
downsampling follows the entropy of blockchain. Moreover, it demonstrates that
the entire blockchain history can be efficiently recovered through the
cooperative decoding of a group of nodes like fountain codes, if reserved data
over these nodes obey the soliton distribution. However, these data on nodes
are uncoded (transparent). Thus, the proposed algorithm not only keeps
decentralization and security, but also has good scalability in independency
and recovery.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The accuracy of power electronics simulation relies on the semiconductor switch model employed. Thus, in this paper where an ultrafast mechatronic circuit breaker (UFMCB) is implemented in real-time on the field programmable gate array, a detailed nonlinear thyristor model is proposed for extra device-level information regarding design evaluation. The cascaded thyristors impose a heavy computational burden on the UFMCB simulation, and node elimination is achieved following the proposal of a scalable thyristor model. For the convenience of the circuit breaker's integration into dc grid, a pair of coupled voltage-current sources is inserted as its interface, which achieves a reduction in the dimension of system admittance matrix, and the subsequent proposal of a relaxed scalar Newton-Raphson method further expedites the simulation by decomposing the nodal matrix equation. Meanwhile, the modular multilevel converter as a dc grid terminal adopts half-bridge and clamped double submodule topologies to test system performance in conjunction with the UFMCB. Real-time execution is achieved and the results are validated by ANSYS/Simplorer and PSCAD/EMTDC in device- and system-level, respectively.

The suggested converter voltage gain is higher than the classic ZETA converter. In the presented converter, only one main switch is utilized. The proposed converter offers low voltage stress of the switch; therefore, the low on-state resistance of the main switch can be selected to decrease the losses of the switch. The presented converter topology is simple; hence, the control of the converter is simple. The converter has the continuous output current.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Torque motor is one key component that directly influences the dynamic performance of jet pipe servo valve in aircraft. In this paper, a novel torque motor with hybrid-magnetization pole arrays is proposed. By changing the magnetization patterns of permanent magnets, the torque motor can significantly improve the output torque by range of 47-52% compared with traditional designs, while maintaining the system size and mass. The design concept and operating principle of the torque motor is presented. The magnetic field distribution is formulated analytically with equivalent magnetic circuit. Different from conventional study, the flux leakage of the permanent magnets and coils is included to improve the model precision. Subsequently, the output torque is derived mathematically from the airgap flux. Following that, the numerical calculation is conducted to validate the mathematical models of magnetic field and output torque. The design optimization is then carried out. One research prototype that can be mounted with either conventional magnet or the proposed hybrid array has been developed. The test rigs are constructed and experiments are conducted on the prototype. Both numerical computation and experimental results verify the significant improvement of torque generation of the proposed hybrid magnetization torque motor.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent development of object detection mainly depends on deep learning with large-scale benchmarks. However, collecting such fully-annotated data is often difficult or expensive for real-world applications, which restricts the power of deep neural networks in practice. Alternatively, humans can detect new objects with little annotation burden, since humans often use the prior knowledge to identify new objects with few elaborately-annotated examples, and subsequently generalize this capacity by exploiting objects from wild images. Inspired by this procedure of learning to detect, we propose a novel Progressive Object Transfer Detection (POTD) framework. Specifically, we make three main contributions in this paper. First, POTD can leverage various object supervision of different domains effectively into a progressive detection procedure. Via such human-like learning, one can boost a target detection task with few annotations. Second, POTD consists of two delicate transfer stages, i.e., Low-Shot Transfer Detection (LSTD), and Weakly-Supervised Transfer Detection (WSTD). In LSTD, we distill the implicit object knowledge of source detector to enhance target detector with few annotations. It can effectively warm up WSTD later on. In WSTD, we design a recurrent object labelling mechanism for learning to annotate weakly-labeled images. More importantly, we exploit the reliable object supervision from LSTD, which can further enhance the robustness of target detector in the WSTD stage. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on a number of challenging detection benchmarks with different settings. The results demonstrate that, our POTD outperforms the recent state-of-the-art approaches. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/Cassie94/LSTD/tree/lstd.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The human visual system tends to consider saliency of an object as a whole. Some object-level saliency detection methods have been proposed by leveraging object proposals in bounding boxes, and regarding the entire bounding box as one candidate salient region. However, the bounding boxes can not provide exact object position and a lot of pixels in bounding boxes belong to the background. Consequently, background pixels in bounding box also show high saliency. Besides, acquiring object proposals needs high time cost. In order to compute object-level saliency, we consider region growing from some seed superpixels, to find one surrounding region which probably represents the whole object. The desired surrounding region has similar appearance inside and obvious difference with the outside, which is proposed as maximally stable region (MSR) in this paper. In addition, one effective seed superpixel selection strategy is presented to improve speed. MSR based saliency detection is more robust than pixel or superpixel level methods and object proposal based methods. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods at 50 FPS. Compared with deep learning based methods, we show worse performance, but with about 1200-1600 times faster, which means better trade-off between performance and speed.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents an energy-efficient localization of sensor nodes in wireless sensor network (WSNs) using beacons from rotating directional antenna. The localization process is scalable, fast, and easily implementable at the nodes, and works for homogeneous as well as heterogeneous networks. The process is suitable for dense and sparse deployment of nodes because communication among nodes is not required and no transmission is needed from nodes to base station (BS). Furthermore, a rotating directional antenna is used at the BS to transmit beacon signal packet containing information about the height of the antenna, current direction, transmitted power, and GPS coordinate of BS. By using the information received from the beacon packets, each node estimates its location relative to BS (in polar coordinate). The time required, energy consumption, and accuracy are estimated analytically. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves accuracy and energy efficiency for two-dimensional localization of sensor nodes in WSNs.

<p>In cyber-physical systems, mobile actuators can enhance system&#x0027;s flexibility and scalability, but at the same time incurs complex couplings in the scheduling and controlling of the actuators. In this paper, we propose a novel event-driven method aiming at satisfying a required level of control accuracy and saving energy consumption of the actuators, while guaranteeing a bounded action delay. We formulate a joint-design problem of both actuator scheduling and output control. To solve this problem, we propose a two-step optimization method. In the first step, the problem of actuator scheduling and action time allocation is decomposed into two subproblems. They are solved iteratively by utilizing the solution of one in the other. The convergence of this iterative algorithm is proved. In the second step, an online method is proposed to estimate the error and adjust the outputs of the actuators accordingly. Through simulations and experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In a noisy manufacturing environment, range-based target localization for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) experiences various variations in range measurements, thus causing the unsatisfactory results. Starting from an empirical observation on the existing various industrial noise distribution, in this paper, a diffusion Gauss&#x2013;Newton (GN) algorithm with cooperation strategy is proposed for solving target localization non linear-least-squares problem in a WSN. The proposed algorithm has an equalization effect on the unbalance noise distribution over the network by aggregating the global estimates into local GN update via diffusion strategy. When facing a hostile industrial environment where the ambient noise is heterogeneous or has the sudden changes across partial nodes, the significant performance degradation is produced by diffusion GN. To solve the problem, we propose further an improved version of diffusion GN, which is adaptive to sudden changes on noisy range measurements. Instead of using a static combiner, the new algorithm leverages the evolutionary game theory to assign a time-varying weight for the estimate from each neighboring node based on the individual range error. Consequently, the good estimates from the neighbors with high SNR have a larger weight in the combiner than the bad estimates caused by the low SNR or high noise. We also propose a simple but effective energy-accuracy tradeoff scheme by using a sigmoidal utility function. Some simulation examples show that the standard diffusion GN is effective in stationary noise and its improved version provides the adaptation to changing noisy environment. The effectiveness of energy&#x2013;accuracy tradeoff is also validated.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Spectral analysis is a practical technology used for rapid analysis of fruit maturity. Least-squares support vector regression (LSSVR) with radial basis function (RBF) kernel is an effective nonlinear method for the quantitative calibration in the visible&#x2013;near-infrared (Vis&#x2013;NIR) spectral region. However, the nonlinear effect and high-dimensional spectrum data influence the prediction accuracy and complexity of modeling procedures. This article presents a fuzzy optimization strategy to improve the performance of the RBF LSSVR model in Vis&#x2013;NIR quantitative determination of pomelo maturity. In the proposed strategy, a linguistic iterative mode is introduced for optimizing RBF kernel parameters. The input variables of the model are the informative features extracted through fuzzy transform principal component analysis algorithm, and the output was a polynomial equation of the inputs. In this article, pomelo maturity is recorded using the quantitative indices of L<sup>&#x002a;</sup>, a<sup>&#x002a;</sup>, and b<sup>&#x002a;</sup>. The Vis&#x2013;NIR spectral data of Pomelo samples are first converted to a set of fuzzy-transformed principal components and inputted into a fuzzy-optimized LSSVR model for calibration, validation, and test. Parameter uncertainty is evaluated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed fuzzy optimization strategy is feasible for reducing the computational complexity of the BRF LSSVR model, and the predictions on L<sup>&#x002a;</sup>, a<sup>&#x002a;</sup>, and b<sup>&#x002a;</sup> are much appreciable. The proposed fuzzy optimization strategy based on the linguistic iteration mode is considered as the effective implementation for calibration models in -

<p>This article presents two novel algorithms for the estimation and diagnosis of the current unbalance factor (CUF) for three-phase power systems from single period of three-phase acquired data samples. The CUF is evaluated by an algorithm named circular phase shift (CPS), and the three-phase parameters are estimated by a circular cross-correlation (CCC) algorithm for unbalance diagnosis. The estimated CUF along with multisensory data is transmitted and monitored through a remote web server for diagnosis and detection of incipient three-phase power systems faults including three-phase machines. The CPS algorithm estimation has an accuracy that exceeds 95&#x0025; for CUF values exceeding 5&#x0025;. The CCC time-complexity and the Cramer&#x2013;Rao Lower Bound analysis are presented for performance evaluation. The CCC algorithm outperforms the IEEE-Standard-1057 estimation method in both phase accuracy and processing memory requirements compatible with low-cost microcontrollers. Experimental results on condition monitoring of industrial induction machines (1.5 to 7.5 KW) are also presented with custom designed 2.4-GHz wireless sensor network and an IEEE 802.11 Internet of Things gateway with multisensory data which carries out the effectiveness of the system.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a new robust field-weakening approach for reluctance synchronous motors regulated by direct torque and flux control. Compared to the existing direct torque and flux control based field-weakening methods that cannot achieve maximized DC-link voltage utilization and are parameter dependent, the proposed approach contributes to improve the field-weakening performance of reluctance synchronous motor in two aspects. First, it extends the constant power speed range through autonomous stator flux reference adjustment, which maximizes the dc-link voltage utilization. Smooth transition between the maximum torque per ampere trajectory and field-weakening trajectory is also realized. Second, it enhances the parameter robustness of drives in very high-speed region by employing a torque reference adjustment scheme. This effectively avoids the instability of drives caused by machine parameter variations. The proposed approach is verified experimentally on a laboratory setup.

<p>The dynamic analysis of induction motors is supported by well-known theories: the two-axes transformation, and the space vector theory. Yet some inconsistencies with the theory of dynamic systems exist. The machine eigenvalues suggest the existence of two damped oscillators, physically not understandable. The respective eigenfrequencies change with the angular velocity of the reference frame. This contradicts the understanding that eigenfrequencies are inherent system properties. Physically, the dynamics depend on the continuous distribution of magnetic energy and its spatial displacement during transient processes. Information on the system dynamics is lost when dividing the continuum of magnetic energy into discrete portions. Complex state variables associate the dynamics to the propagation in space of distributed magnetic fields. The dynamic analysis reveals the existence single-complex eigenvalues. These define a novel class of system identifiers. They are characterized by having only one imaginary part instead of a conjugate complex pair. The use of complex state variables conveys insight and physical understanding of the dynamic processes within the machine. The approach constitutes an extension to the theory of dynamic systems.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Massive MIMO attains high spectral and power efficiency transmission by leveraging a large number of transmit antennas. However, to capture the benefits of massive MIMO, each antenna should be accompanied with a dedicated RF chain, and consequently, the hardware costs would scale up tremendously with the increase of the antennas. Cheap implementations of massive MIMO have recently gained considerable attention, and constant modulus (CM) signaling is seen as a promising solution, owing to its low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). This paper investigates the physical-layer (PHY) security in massive MIMO with an emphasis on the CM signaling. In particular, we consider a transmitter with massive antennas broadcast common confidential information to a group of legitimate receivers, and a number of eavesdroppers overhear the transmission and attempt to intercept the information. Our goal is to design the CM beamforming at the transmitter so that the multicast secrecy rate is maximized. This secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is generally NP-hard. To tackle it, two tractable approaches are developed. The first one employs the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique and the Charnes-Copper transformation to obtain a convex relaxation of the SRM problem. However, due to the dimension lifting of SDR, this approach is feasible only for small to medium antenna sizes. The second approach leverages the Dinkelbach method to work directly over the beamformer domain; a custom-build nonconvex alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed to efficiently perform each Dinkelbach update. Simulation results demonstrate that the second approach is computationally more efficient and can achieve nearly optimal performance when the number of antennas is large.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has recently identified digital relays as targets vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The DHS has also noted that attacks to multiple relays can bring about cascading outages of transmission lines, leading to blackouts. As a result, making protective relays cyber-resilient is a prominent security issue in power networks. Line current differential relays (LCDRs) are among the potentially vulnerable digital relays that are increasingly deployed for protecting critical transmission lines. LCDRs, however, lack the required resiliency against cyber attacks, due to their high dependence on communication systems. This paper unveils that such susceptibilities can result in unwarranted trip signals through false data injection attacks (FDIAs), and so cause instability if several attacks are coordinated. It also presents a solution for detecting FDIAs and distinguishing them from real internal faults. To detect attacks, the proposed method compares the estimated and locally measured voltages at an LCDR's terminal for both the positive sequence (PS) and negative sequence (NS). To estimate the local voltage for each sequence, the proposed technique uses an unknown input observer (UIO), the state-space model of the faulty line, and remote and local measurements, all associated with that sequence. The difference between the measured and estimated local voltages for each sequence remains close to zero during real internal faults because, in this condition, the state-space model based on which the UIO operates correctly represents the line. Nevertheless, the state-space model mismatch during FDIAs leads to a large difference between measured and estimated values in both sequences. The effectiveness of the proposed method is corroborated using simulation results for the IEEE 39-bus network.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the optimal tradeoff between secrecy and non-secrecy rates of the MISO wiretap channels for different power constraint settings: sum power constraint only, per-antenna power constraints only, and joint sum and per-antenna power constraints. The problem is motivated by the fact that channel capacity and secrecy capacity are generally achieved by different transmit strategies. First, a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure a positive secrecy capacity is shown. The optimal tradeoff between secrecy rate and transmission rate is characterized by a weighted rate sum maximization problem. Since this problem is not necessarily convex, equivalent problem formulations are introduced to derive the optimal transmit strategies. Under sum power constraint only, a closed-form solution is provided. Under per-antenna power constraints, necessary conditions to find the optimal power allocation are derived. Sufficient conditions are provided for the special case of two transmit antennas. For the special case of aligned channels, the optimal transmit strategies can deduced from an equivalent point-to-point channel problem. Last, the theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Anomaly detection is an important technique used to identify patterns of unusual network behavior and keep the network under control. Today, network attacks are increasing in terms of both their number and sophistication. To avoid causing significant traffic patterns and being detected by existing techniques, many new attacks tend to involve gradual adjustment of behaviors, which always generate incomplete sessions due to their running mechanisms. Accordingly, in this work, we employ the behavior symmetry degree to profile the anomalies and further identify unusual behaviors. We first proposed a symmetry degree to identify the incomplete sessions generated by unusual behaviors; we then employ a sketch to calculate the symmetry degree of internal hosts to improve the identification efficiency for online applications. To reduce the memory cost and probability of collision, we divide the IP addresses into four segments that can be used as keys of the hash functions in the sketch. Moreover, to further improve detection accuracy, a threshold selection method is proposed for dynamic traffic pattern analysis. The hash functions in the sketch are then designed using Chinese remainder theory, which can analytically trace the IP addresses associated with the anomalies. We tested the proposed techniques based on traffic data collected from the northwest center of CERNET (China Education and Research Network); the results show that the proposed methods can effectively detect anomalies in large-scale networks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Image restoration (IR) is a long-standing challenging problem in low-level image processing. It is of utmost importance to learn good image priors for pursuing visually pleasing results. In this paper, we develop a multi-channel and multi-model-based denoising autoencoder network as image prior for solving IR problem. Specifically, the network that trained on RGB-channel images is used to construct a prior at first, and then the learned prior is incorporated into single-channel grayscale IR tasks. To achieve the goal, we employ the auxiliary variable technique to integrate the higher-dimensional network-driven prior information into the iterative restoration procedure. In addition, according to the weighted aggregation idea, a multi-model strategy is put forward to enhance the network stability that favors to avoid getting trapped in local optima. Extensive experiments on image deblurring and deblocking tasks show that the proposed algorithm is efficient, robust, and yields state-of-the-art restoration quality on grayscale images.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Point cloud-based immersive media representation format has provided many opportunities for extended reality applications and has become widely used in volumetric content capturing scenarios. The high data rate of the point cloud is one of the key problems preventing the adoption of this media format. MPEG Immersive media working group (MPEG-I) aims to create a point cloud compression methodology relying on the existing video coding hardware implementations to solve this problem. However, in the scope of the state-of-the-art video-based dynamic point cloud compression (V-PCC) standard under MPEG-I, the intrinsic 3D object's motion continuity is destroyed by the 2D projections, resulting in a significant loss of inter prediction coding efficiency. In this paper, we first propose a general model utilizing the 3D motion and 3D to 2D correspondence to calculate the 2D motion vector (MV). Then, under the V-PCC, we propose a geometry-based method using the accurate 3D reconstructed geometry from the 2D geometry video to estimate the 2D MV in the 2D attribute video. In addition, we propose an auxiliary-information-based method using the coarse 3D reconstructed geometry provided by the auxiliary information to estimate the 2D MV in both the 2D geometry and attribute videos. Furthermore, we provide the following two ways to use the estimated 2D MV to improve coding efficiency. The first one is normative. We propose adding the estimated MV into the advanced MV candidate list and find a better MV predictor for each prediction unit (PU). The second one is non-normative. We propose applying the estimated MV as an additional candidate of the centers for motion estimation. We implement the proposed algorithms in the V-PCC reference software. Experimental results show that the proposed methods present significant coding gains compared with the current state-of-the-art motion prediction algorithm.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel deep sparse coding network (SCN) capable of efficiently adapting its own regularization parameters for a given application. The network is trained end-to-end with a supervised task-driven learning algorithm via error backpropagation. During training, the network learns both the dictionaries and the regularization parameters of each sparse coding layer so that the reconstructive dictionaries are smoothly transformed into increasingly discriminative representations. In addition, the adaptive regularization also offers the network more flexibility to adjust sparsity levels. Furthermore, we have devised a sparse coding layer utilizing a &#x201c;skinny&#x201d; dictionary. Integral to computational efficiency, these skinny dictionaries compress the high-dimensional sparse codes into lower dimensional structures. The adaptivity and discriminability of our 15-layer SCN are demonstrated on six benchmark datasets, namely Cifar-10, Cifar-100, STL-10, SVHN, MNIST, and ImageNet, most of which are considered difficult for sparse coding models. Experimental results show that our architecture overwhelmingly outperforms traditional one-layer sparse coding architectures while using much fewer parameters. Moreover, our multilayer architecture exploits the benefits of depth with sparse coding's characteristic ability to operate on smaller datasets. In such data-constrained scenarios, our technique demonstrates a highly competitive performance compared with the deep neural networks.
