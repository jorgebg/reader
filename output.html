<p>Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have improved many aspects of healthcare and
allowed for easier patient management for medical providers. Blockchains have
been proposed as a promising solution for supporting Electronic Health Records
(EHRs), but have also been linked to scalability concerns about supporting
real-world healthcare systems. This paper quantifies the scalability issues and
bottlenecks related to current blockchains and puts into perspective the
limitations blockchains have with supporting healthcare systems. Particularly
we show that well known blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and IOTA cannot
support transactions of a large scale hospital system such as the University of
Kentucky HealthCare system and leave over 7.5M unsealed transactions per day.
We then discuss how bottlenecks of blockchains can be relieved with sidechains,
enabling well-known blockchains to support even larger hospital systems of over
30M transactions per day. We then introduce the Patient-Healthchain
architecture to provide future direction on how scaling blockchains for EHR
systems with sidechains can be achieved.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In recent years, neural networks have been extensively deployed for computer
vision tasks, particularly visual classification problems, where new algorithms
reported to achieve or even surpass the human performance. Recent studies have
shown that they are all vulnerable to the attack of adversarial examples. Small
and often imperceptible perturbations to the input images are sufficient to
fool the most powerful neural networks. \emph{Advbox} is a toolbox to generate
adversarial examples that fool neural networks in PaddlePaddle, PyTorch,
Caffe2, MxNet, Keras, TensorFlow and it can benchmark the robustness of machine
learning models. Compared to previous work, our platform supports black box
attacks on Machine-Learning-as-a-service, as well as more attack scenarios,
such as Face Recognition Attack, Stealth T-shirt, and Deepfake Face Detect. The

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer payment system proposed by Nakamoto in 2008. Based
on the Nakamoto consensus, Bagaria, Kannan, Tse, Fanti, and Viswanath proposed
the Prism protocol in 2018 and showed that it achieves near-optimal blockchain
throughput while maintaining similar level of security as bitcoin. This work
provides the probabilistic guarantees for the liveliness and consistency of
bitcoin and Prism transactions. Previous analyses of the bitcoin and Prism have
been either established under a simplified discrete-time model or expressed in
terms of exponential order result. This paper presents a streamlined and
strengthened analysis under a more realistic continuous-time model where the
block propagation delays are heterogeneous, arbitrary, and upper bounded by
some constant. The goal is to show that every valid transaction becomes
permanent in all honest miners' blockchains under a certain "typical event",
which occurs with probability close to 1. To that end, we establish the
blockchain growth theorem, the blockchain quality theorem, and the common
prefix theorem. In lieu of exponential order result in the literature, the
probabilistic guarantees for the desired properties of the bitcoin and Prism
protocols take the form of explicit expressions here, which provide improved
design references for public transaction ledger protocols.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Nearly all modern software suffers from bloat that negatively impacts its
performance and security. To combat this problem, several automated techniques
have been proposed to debloat software. A key metric used in many of these
works to demonstrate improved security is code reuse gadget count reduction.
The use of this metric is based on the prevailing idea that reducing the number
of gadgets available in a software package reduces its attack surface and makes
mounting a gadget-based code reuse exploit such as return-oriented programming
(ROP) more difficult for an attacker. In this paper, we challenge this idea and
show through a variety of realistic debloating scenarios the flaws inherent to
the gadget count reduction metric. Specifically, we demonstrate that software
debloating can achieve high gadget count reduction rates, yet fail to limit an
attacker's ability to construct an exploit. Worse yet, in some scenarios high
gadget count reduction rates conceal instances in which software debloating
makes security worse by introducing new, useful gadgets. To address these
issues, we propose a set of four new metrics for measuring security
improvements realized through software debloating that are quality-oriented
rather than quantity-oriented. We show that these metrics can identify when
debloating negatively impacts security and be efficiently calculated using our
static binary analysis tool, the Gadget Set Analyzer. Finally, we demonstrate
the utility of these metrics in two realistic case studies: iterative
debloating and debloater evaluation.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Bitcoin-NG is among the first blockchain protocols to approach the
near-optimal throughput by decoupling blockchain operation into two planes:
leader election and transaction serialization. Its decoupling idea has inspired
a new generation of high-performance blockchain protocols. However, the
existing incentive analysis of Bitcoin-NG has several limitations. First, the
impact of network capacity is ignored. Second, an integrated incentive analysis
that jointly considers both key blocks and microblocks is still missing.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we aim to address the two limitations. First, we propose a new
incentive analysis that takes the network capacity into account, showing that
Bitcoin-NG can achieve better incentive compatibility against the microblock
mining attack under limited network capacity. Second, we leverage a Markov
decision process (MDP) to jointly analyze the incentive of both key blocks and
microblocks, showing that Bitcoin-NG is as secure as Bitcoin when the adversary
controls less than 35% of the computation power. We hope that our in-depth
incentive analysis for Bitcoin-NG can shed some light on the mechanism design
and incentive analysis of next-generation blockchain protocols.

<p>In Reply Based on the letters from Mr Schneider, Drs Everett and Isea, and Dr Battisti, we find 2 key issues to discuss&#8212;transparency and competency. We absolutely agree that increased transparency and access to data, both from medical schools and through ERAS, would facilitate holistic review. Program directors have been lamenting the erosion of meaningful performance measures for years as medical schools increasingly moved to pass-fail grading. We wonder what role the narrow focus on academic metrics in residency selection may have played during this transition. Broadening the selection criteria beyond academic metrics in true holistic review may be a more successful approach for encouraging data release than further demands for score details. Realistic solutions include use of additional information already collected by ERAS, such as student experiences (volunteer work, research productivity) and attributes (language skills, regional ties, distance traveled), to filter applicants for review. Once a reasonable number of applications is identified, each can be individually assessed for mission-specific factors including medical knowledge.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We study the trade-off between secret message (SM) and secret key (SK) rates, simultaneously achievable over a state-dependent (SD) wiretap channel (WTC) with non-causal channel state information (CSI) at the encoder. This model subsumes other instances of CSI availability as special cases, and calls for efficient utilization of the state sequence for both reliability and security purposes. An inner bound on the semantic-security (SS) SM-SK capacity region is derived based on a superposition coding scheme inspired by a past work of the authors. The region is shown to attain capacity for a certain class of SD-WTCs. SS is established by virtue of two versions of the strong soft-covering lemma. The derived region yields an improvement upon the previously best known SM-SK trade-off result reported by Prabhakaran et al., and, to the best of our knowledge, upon all other existing lower bounds for either SM or SK for this setup, even if the semantic security requirement is relaxed to weak secrecy. It is demonstrated that our region can be strictly larger than those reported in the preceding works.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recently, axial displacement detection of transformer winding has been performed using synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) imaging, as an online method, in ultra-wideband frequency band. Another important problem in power transformers is partial discharge (PD), which emits signal in the ultra-high-frequency (UHF) frequency band. If detection of axial displacement using SAR imaging can be applied to the UHF band, both defects can be detected using only one set of antennas and application of these methods can be more economic. However, as shown in this paper, using the same frequency band for detection of both defects leads to wrong conclusions about winding conditions, if PD is occurred during the application of SAR imaging. As a solution, UHF stepped-frequency imaging method and generalized likelihood ratio test method are proposed for detection of axial displacement. Finally, on a three-phase real transformer both defects are simultaneously detected using designed monitoring system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper addresses the problem of sensor selection in a sensor network for tracking a moving target. By considering network uncertainties and unpredictable movements of the target, reliable sensor selection approaches such as sigma points probability and target trajectory are proposed. An updated unscented Kalman filter is proposed to achieve effective tracking of the target through the sensor selection. A multialgorithm genetically adaptive multiobjective is utilized to have a selection strategy without knowing the number of sensors to be selected. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach both in simulation and practical experimentation. The proposed algorithm is also tested in the industrial setting where providing safety is of great importance for a human worker who walks in a potentially dangerous workplace. The results confirm the effectiveness and utility of the proposed scheme.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The mission abort is an effective action to reduce the risk of casualties and enhance the survivability of mission-based systems such as aircrafts, submarines, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A main task in real operations is to strive for balance between the mission reliability and the system survivability via elaborate mission abort plans. In this paper, we design the optimal mission abort policies based on the information of early-warning signals, which indicates the possible forthcoming fatal malfunction. Depending on the acquisition time of such information, the operator may immediately abort the mission, or ignore the information and continue the task. Within the framework of a constant mission duration, we carry out an economic analysis for the above problem. The optimal abort decision that minimizes the expected total economic loss is investigated. We further extend the proposed model to the scenario of a random mission duration and derive the corresponding optimal abort decisions. A case study on a UAV executing power-grid inspection missions is used to illustrate the applicability of the abort policies.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In past research, in-hand object manipulation for various sized and shaped objects has been achieved. However, the network had to be trained for each different motion. Training data takes time to acquire and increases the hardware load, thereby increasing the cost for training data. Four-fingered in-hand manipulation is especially difficult as a high number of joints need to be controlled in synchrony. This paper presents a method that reduces the required training data for in-hand manipulation with the idea of pretraining and mutual finger motions. The Allegro Hand is used with soft fingertips and integrated 6-axis F/T sensors to evaluate the proposed method. To make the network more versatile, the training data included objects of various sizes and shapes. When pretraining the network, one shot learning suffices to learn a new task; mutual finger motions can be exploited to use three-fingered pretraining data for four-fingered manipulation. Both data-sharing and weight-sharing were used and show similar results. Crucially, pretraining data from fingers with the same kinematic chain has to be used, showing the importance of morphology specific learning. Moreover, objects with untrained sizes and shapes could be manipulated.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In order to solve the problem of low detection accuracy of small targets in the SSD detection algorithm, a pipeline magnetic flux leakage image detection algorithm based on multiscale SSD network is proposed in this paper. The dilated convolution and attention residual module are introduced into the SSD algorithm to fuse the low-resolution high-semantic information feature map with the high-resolution low-semantic information feature map so as to improve the resolution of the low-resolution feature map and provide detailed features for small targets. Finally, the target location and category are obtained by regression algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can automatically identify the location of circumferential weld, spiral weld, and defect of magnetic flux leakage data. Compared with the original SSD algorithm framework, the improved algorithm has higher detection accuracy, 97.62&#x0025;, 18.01&#x0025; lower false detection rate, 18.36&#x0025; lower false detection rate, better robustness, and obvious effect on small target detection.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims at matching person images captured in non-overlapping camera views. To represent person appearance, low-level visual features are sensitive to environmental changes, while high-level semantic attributes, such as &#x201c;short-hair&#x201d; or &#x201c;long-hair&#x201d;, are relatively stable. Hence, researches have started to design semantic attributes to reduce the visual ambiguity. However, to train a prediction model for semantic attributes, it requires plenty of annotations, which are hard to obtain in practical large-scale applications. To alleviate the reliance on annotation efforts, we propose to incrementally generate Deep Hidden Attribute (DHA) based on baseline deep network for newly uncovered annotations. In particular, we propose an auto-encoder model that can be plugged into any deep network to mine latent information in an unsupervised manner. To optimize the effectiveness of DHA, we reform the auto-encoder model with additional orthogonal generation module, along with identity-preserving and sparsity constraints. 1) Orthogonally generating: In order to make DHAs different from each other, Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD) is introduced to generate DHAs orthogonally. 2) Identity-preserving constraint: The generated DHAs should be distinct for telling different persons, so we associate DHAs with person identities. 3) Sparsity constraint: To enhance the discriminability of DHAs, we also introduce the sparsity constraint to restrict the number of effective DHAs for each person. Experiments conducted on public datasets have validated the effectiveness of the proposed network. On two large-scale datasets, i.e., Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

However, hard negative samples usually account for the tiny minority in the training set, which may fail to fully describe the data distribution close to the decision boundary. In this paper, we present a deep adversarial metric learning (DAML) framework to generate synthetic hard negatives from the original negative samples, which is widely applicable to existing supervised deep metric learning algorithms. Different from existing sampling strategies which simply ignore numerous easy negatives, our DAML aim to exploit them by generating synthetic hard negatives adversarial to the learned metric as complements. We simultaneously train the feature embedding and hard negative generator in an adversarial manner, so that adequate and targeted synthetic hard negatives are created to learn more precise distance metrics. As a single transformation may not be powerful enough to describe the global input space under the attack of the hard negative generator, we further propose a deep adversarial multi-metric learning (DAMML) method by learning multiple local transformations for more complete description. We simultaneously exploit the collaborative and competitive relationships among multiple metrics, where the metrics display unity against the generator for effective distance measurement as well as compete for more training data through a metric discriminator to avoid overlapping. Extensive experimental results on five benchmark datasets show that our DAML and DAMML effectively boost the performance of existing deep metric learning approaches through adversarial learning.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>While analyzing the performance of state-of-the-art R-CNN based generic object detectors, we find that the detection performance for objects with low object-region-percentages (ORPs) of the bounding boxes are much lower than the overall average. Elongated objects are examples. To address the problem of low ORPs for elongated object detection, we propose a hybrid approach which employs a Faster R-CNN to achieve robust detections of object parts, and a novel model-driven clustering algorithm to group the related partial detections and suppress false detections. First, we train a Faster R-CNN with partial region proposals of suitable and stable ORPs. Next, we introduce a deep CNN (DCNN) for orientation classification on the partial detections. Then, on the outputs of the Faster R-CNN and DCNN, the algorithm of adaptive model-driven clustering first initializes a model of an elongated object with a data-driven process on local partial detections, and refines the model iteratively by model-driven clustering and data-driven model updating. By exploiting Faster R-CNN to produce robust partial detections and model-driven clustering to form a global representation, our method is able to generate a tight oriented bounding box for elongated object detection. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on two typical elongated objects in the COCO dataset, and other typical elongated objects, including rigid objects (pens, screwdrivers and wrenches) and non-rigid objects (cracks). Experimental results show that, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a large margin of improvements for both detection and localization of elongated objects in images.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Tone Mapping Operators (TMO) designed for videos can be classified into two categories. In a first approach, TMOs are temporal filtered to reduce temporal artifacts and provide a Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) content with improved temporal consistency. This however does not improve the SDR coding Rate Distortion (RD) performances. A second approach is to design the TMO with the goal of optimizing the SDR coding rate-distortion performances. This second category of methods may lead to SDR videos altering the artistic intent compared with the produced HDR content. In this paper, we combine the benefits of the two approaches by introducing new Weighted Prediction (WP) methods inside the HEVC SDR codec. As a first step, we demonstrate the interest of the WP methods compared to TMO optimized for RD performances. Then we present the newly introduced WP algorithm and WP modes. The WP algorithm consists in performing a global motion compensation between frames using an optical flow, and the new modes are based on non linear functions in contrast with the literature using only linear functions. The contribution of each novelty is studied independently and in a second time they are all put in competition to maximize the RD performances. Tests were made for HDR backward compatible compression but also for SDR compression only. In both cases, the proposed WP methods improve the RD performances while maintaining the SDR temporal coherency.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Finding suitable image representations for the task at hand is critical in computer vision. Different approaches extending the original Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) model have recently been proposed to offer rotation-invariant feature learning. In this paper, we present an extended novel RBM that learns rotation invariant features by explicitly factorizing for rotation nuisance in 2D image inputs within an unsupervised framework. While the goal is to learn invariant features, our model infers an orientation per input image during training, using information related to the reconstruction error. The training process is regularised by a Kullback-Leibler divergence, offering stability and consistency. We used the  $gamma $ -score, a measure that calculates the amount of invariance, to mathematically and experimentally demonstrate that our approach indeed learns rotation invariant features. We show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art RBM approaches for rotation invariant feature learning on three different benchmark datasets, by measuring the performance with the test accuracy of an SVM classifier. Our implementation is available at https://bitbucket.org/tuttoweb/rotinvrbm.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>For high-speed permanent magnet machines (HSPMMs), the permanent magnet (PM) is more likely to suffer irreversible demagnetization because the heat dissipation is serious in the HSPMMs, especially for the high-power machines. This paper focuses on the comprehensive research results on the power loss and thermal characteristic for a high-power HSPMM. First, the power loss at the rated load is investigated by finite-element analysis. Then, the temperature distribution of four cooling schemes is compared by the electromagnetic-thermal iteration calculation. The effect of different parameters on thermal behavior is obtained to reduce rotor temperature, which includes an examination of the axial flow duct, cooling medium, sleeve thickness, and sleeve thermal conductivity. Finally, an improved loss separation method is employed to obtain the loss distribution from the measured total loss, and the comprehensive experiments are implemented based on one HSPMM prototype (800 kW, 15 000 rpm) to verify the related theoretical analysis.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Differential power processing (DPP) is a promising architecture to solve the issue caused by mismatches among photovoltaic (PV) submodules. To eliminate the mismatch power losses, this paper presents an optimized PV-to-bus DPP system with submodule-level individual maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and module-level minimum-power tracking (MPT) simultaneous implementation according to the built mathematical model of the power processed by DPP converters with respect to the string current. Furthermore, a flexible time-sharing algorithm is adopted to reduce the number of MPPT units. Compared with other solutions, such as PV optimizer, the proposed scheme can reduce the effects of mismatches to the minimum regardless of mismatch conditions. The system cost is reduced since only one adaptive MPPT controller is required. Besides, the system efficiency is improved due to the true MPPT implementation and MPT control. Both simulation and experimental tests are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, closed-loop control and boundary condition for continuous conduction mode and discontinuous conduction mode of nonisolated inverting N&#x00d7; multilevel boost converter (MBC) are articulated. Inverting N&#x00d7; MBC combines the features of classical boost converter and voltage multiplier to attain inverting N times higher voltage. Consequently, the inverting N&#x00d7; MBC provides a viable solution for high-voltage step-up photovoltaic applications with low voltage rating reactive components and semiconductor devices. The control strategy with saturation limiter is employed to achieve highly stable voltage. The modes of operation, benefits of inverting N&#x00d7; MBC, and key factors for the selection of semiconductor devices and sizing of the reactive components are discussed. Additionally, the effects of reactive components and semiconductor devices on the output voltage are examined. Experimental results of the developed circuit are presented to validate the design of converter, and effectiveness and robustness of the implemented control algorithm for different input and output side perturbations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Time delay control (TDC) is a promising technique for robot manipulators because it is model-free, efficient, and yet, robust. Nevertheless, when a robot operates under significant payload changes, it is difficult to achieve satisfactory performance with a constant gain. To cope with this problem, several adaptive rules have already been proposed thus far, but they are less effective to significant payload changes, and parameter tuning procedures are too complicated. In this paper, we propose an adaptive gain dynamics that is more effective in payload changes and yet simpler to implement. Through simulations using a one-link arm and experiments using a whole arm manipulator with payload changes, the proposed dynamics was compared with the conventional TDC and two other existing methods. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can adapt to significant payload changes, achieving better accuracy than the conventional TDC. Experimental results show that the proposed method has consistently better adaptation capability than other methods, achieving significantly better accuracy. In addition, the proposed method is simpler to implement, having only one tuning parameter, whereas the existing methods require four or five such tuning parameters.
