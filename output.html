In the Malappuram district of Kerala, which has a substantial Muslim population, we found that factors such as religion have only a minor role in resistance to vaccination (unpublished findings). Many religious leaders openly support vaccination drives and consider that religious texts and beliefs do not oppose disease prevention.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Advanced persistent threat (APT) is a new kind of cyberattack that poses a serious threat to modern society. When an APT campaign on an organization has been identified, the available repair resources must be reasonably allocated to the potentially insecure hosts to mitigate the potential loss of the organization. We refer to the feasible repair resource allocation strategies as repair strategies. This paper focuses on the APT repair problem, i.e., the problem of developing effective repair strategies for organizations. First, for an organization with time-varying communication relationship, we establish an evolution model of the organization&#x2019;s expected state, in which the impact of lateral movement of APT is accommodated. On this basis, we model the APT repair problem as a differential Nash game problem (the APT repair game) in which the attacker attempts to maximize his potential benefit, and the organization manages to minimize its potential loss. Second, we derive a system (the potential system) for calculating a potential Nash equilibrium of an APT repair game, and we examine the structure of the potential attack and repair strategies in a potential Nash equilibrium. Next, we solve some potential systems to get the corresponding potential Nash equilibria. Finally, by comparison with a large number of randomly generated attack and repair strategies, we conclude that the potential Nash equilibrium of each APT repair game is a Nash equilibrium of the game. Therefore, we recommend to organizations their respective potential repair strategies. Our findings help to better understand and effectively defend against APT.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In real-world applications, different kinds of learning and prediction errors are likely to incur different costs for the same system. Moreover, in practice, the cost label information is often available only for a few training samples. In a semi-supervised setting, label propagation is critical to infer the cost information for unlabeled training data. The existing methods typically conduct label propagation independently ahead of supervised cost-sensitive learning. The precomputed label information is kept fixed, which may become suboptimal in the subsequent learning process and hence degrade the overall system performance. In this paper, we develop a unified cost-sensitive framework for semi-supervised face recognition that can jointly optimize the inferred label information and the classifier in an iterative manner. Our experiments on face benchmark datasets demonstrate that in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods for label propagation and cost-sensitive learning, the proposed approach can significantly improve the overall system performance, especially in terms of classification errors associated with high costs.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Digital reconstruction of mechanically shredded documents has received increasing attention in the last years mainly for historical and forensics needs. Computational methods to solve this problem are highly desirable in order to mitigate the time-consuming human effort and to preserve document integrity. The reconstruction of strips-shredded documents is accomplished by horizontally splicing pieces so that the arising sequence (solution) is as similar as the original document. In this context, a central issue is the quantification of the fitting between the pieces (strips), which generally involves stating a function that associates a pair of strips to a real value indicating the fitting quality. This problem is also more challenging for text documents, such as business letters or legal documents, since they depict poor color information. The system proposed here addresses this issue by exploring character shapes as visual features for compatibility computation. Experiments conducted with real mechanically shredded documents showed that our approach outperformed in accuracy other popular techniques in the literature considering documents with (almost) only textual content.

<p>Efficient security patch distribution is of essential importance for updating anti-virus software to ensure effective and timely virus detection and cleanup. In this paper, we propose a mixed strategy of patch distribution to combine the advantages of the traditional centralized patch distribution strategy and decentralized patch distribution strategy. A novel network model that contains a central node and a multiplex network composed of patch dissemination network layer and virus propagation network layer is presented, and a competing spreading dynamical process on top of the network model that simulates the interplay between virus propagation and patch dissemination is developed. Such a new framework helps in effectively analyzing the impacts of patches distribution on virus propagation, and developing more realizable schemes for restraining virus propagation. Furthermore, considering the constraints of the capacity of the central node and the bandwidth of network links, an optimal allocation approach of patches is proposed, which could simultaneously optimize multiple dynamical parameters to effectively restrain the virus propagation with a given budget.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The connected vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) and cloud computing technology allows entities in VANET to enjoy the advantageous storage and computing services offered by some cloud service provider. However, the advantages do not come free, since their combination brings many new security and privacy requirements for VANET applications. In this paper, we investigate the cloud-based road condition monitoring (RCoM) scenario, where the authority needs to monitor real-time road conditions with the help of a cloud server so that it could make sound responses to emergency cases timely. When some bad road condition is detected, e.g., some geologic hazard or accident happens, vehicles on site are able to report such information to a cloud server engaged by the authority. We focus on addressing three key issues in RCoM. First, the vehicles have to be authorized by some roadside unit before generating a road condition report in the domain and uploading it to the cloud server. Second, to guarantee the privacy against the cloud server, the road condition information should be reported in ciphertext format, which requires that the cloud server should be able to distinguish the reported data from different vehicles in ciphertext format for the same place without compromising their confidentiality. Third, the cloud server and authority should be able to validate the report source, i.e., to check whether the road conditions are reported by legitimate vehicles. To address these issues, we present an efficient RCoM scheme, analyze its efficiency theoretically, and demonstrate the practicality through experiments.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fractional-pel accurate motion is widely used in video coding. For subband coding, fractional-pel accuracy is challenging since it is difficult to handle the complex motion field with temporal transforms. In our previous work, we designed integer accurate motion-adaptive transforms (MAT) which can transform integer accurate motion-connected coefficients. In this paper, we extend the integer MAT to fractional-pel accuracy. The integer MAT allows only one reference coefficient to be the lowband coefficient. In this paper, we design the transform such that it permits multiple references and generates multiple lowband coefficients. In addition, our fractional-pel MAT can incorporate a general interpolation filter into the basis vector, such that the highband coefficient produced by the transform is the same as the prediction error from the interpolation filter. The fractional-pel MAT is always orthonormal. Thus, the energy is preserved by the transform. We compare the proposed fractional-pel MAT, the integer MAT, and the half-pel motion-compensated orthogonal transform (MCOT), while HEVC intra coding is used to encode the temporal subbands. The experimental results show that the proposed fractional-pel MAT outperforms the integer MAT and the half-pel MCOT. The gain achieved by the proposed MAT over the integer MAT can reach up to 1 dB in PSNR.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We present an image captioning framework that generates captions under a given topic. The topic candidates are extracted from the caption corpus. A given image&#x2019;s topics are then selected from these candidates by a CNN-based multi-label classifier. The input to the caption generation model is an image-topic pair, and the output is a caption of the image. For this purpose, a cross-modal embedding method is learned for the images, topics, and captions. In the proposed framework, the topic, caption, and image are organized in a hierarchical structure, which is preserved in the embedding space by using the order-embedding method. The caption embedding is upper bounded by the corresponding image embedding and lower bounded by the topic embedding. The lower bound pushes the images and captions about the same topic closer together in the embedding space. A bidirectional caption-image retrieval task is conducted on the learned embedding space and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the embedding method. To generate a caption for an image, an embedding vector is sampled from the region bounded by the embeddings of the image and the topic, then a language model decodes it to a sentence as the output. The lower bound set by the topic shrinks the output space of the language model, which may help the model to learn to match images and captions better. Experiments on the image captioning task on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets validate the usefulness of this framework by showing that the different given topics can lead to different captions describing specific aspects of the given image and that the quality of generated captions is higher than the control model without a topic as input. In addition, the proposed method is competitive with many state-of-the-art methods in terms of standard evaluation metrics.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Hypergraph learning has been widely exploited in various image processing applications, due to its advantages in modeling the high-order information. Its efficacy highly depends on building an informative hypergraph structure to accurately and robustly formulate the underlying data correlation. However, the existing hypergraph learning methods are sensitive to non-Gaussian noise, which hurts the corresponding performance. In this paper, we present a noise-resistant hypergraph learning model, which provides superior robustness against various non-Gaussian noises. In particular, our model adopts low-rank representation to construct a hypergraph, which captures the globally linear data structure as well as preserving the grouping effect of highly correlated data. We further introduce a correntropy-induced local metric to measure the reconstruction errors, which is particularly robust to non-Gaussian noises. Finally, the Frobenious-norm-based regularization is proposed to combine with the low-rank regularizer, which enables our model to regularize the singular values of the coefficient matrix. By such, the non-zero coefficients are selected to generate a hyperedge set as well as the hyperedge weights. We have evaluated the proposed hypergraph model in the tasks of image clustering and semi-supervised image classification. Quantitatively, our scheme significantly enhances the performance of the state-of-the-art hypergraph models on several benchmark data sets.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose a Group-Sparse Representation-based method with applications to Face Recognition (GSR-FR). The novel sparse representation variational model includes a non-convex sparsity-inducing penalty and a robust non-convex loss function. The penalty encourages group sparsity by using an approximation of the  $ell _{0}$ -quasinorm, and the loss function is chosen to make the algorithm robust to noise, occlusions, and disguises. The solution of the non-trivial non-convex optimization problem is efficiently obtained by a majorization-minimization strategy combined with forward-backward splitting, which, in particular, reduces the solution to a sequence of easier convex optimization sub-problems. Extensive experiments on widely used face databases show the potentiality of the proposed model and demonstrate that the GSR-FR algorithm is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods based on sparse representation, especially for very low dimensional feature spaces.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Learning similarity of two images is an important problem in computer vision and has many potential applications. Most of the previous works focus on generating image similarities in three aspects: global feature distance computing, local feature matching, and image concepts comparison. However, the task of directly detecting the class agnostic common objects from two images has not been studied before, which goes one step further to capture image similarities at the region level. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end image Common Object Detection Network (CODN) to detect class agnostic common objects from two images. The proposed method consists of two main modules: locating module and matching module. The locating module generates candidate proposals of each two images. The matching module learns the similarities of the candidate proposal pairs from two images, and refines the bounding boxes of the candidate proposals. The learning procedure of CODN is implemented in an integrated way and a multi-task loss is designed to guarantee both region localization and common object matching. Experiments are conducted on PASCAL VOC 2007 and COCO 2014 datasets. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Fault detection and diagnosis in the pumping unit is a challenging industrial problem for the system that exhibits nonlinearity, coupled parameters, and time-varying noise. This paper proposes a novel combined unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and radial basis function (RBF) method based on an adaptive noise factor for fault diagnosis in the pumping unit. First, to reduce computation and complexity of the diagnosis model, the Fourier descriptor method based on an approximate polygon is presented to extract the features of the indicator diagram. RBF neural network is adopted to establish the fault diagnosis model based on indicator diagram data and production data. In particular, UKF is used to train the weights ($w_{m,l}$), the center ($c_{m}$), and the width ($b_{m}$) of the RBF model. Furthermore, the adaptive noise factor method is proposed to address the adaptive filtering issue in the fault diagnosis model. The proposed method is applied to the pumping unit system, and experimental results show the effectiveness and favorable recognition rate in classifying multiple faults.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A large number of industrial video applications are expected to work in real-time and power-constrained scenarios. For such applications, the coding complexity has a great impact on their performance. In this paper, we propose a complexity control method in the high-efficiency video coding intracoding to facilitate these video applications. The proposed method is performed on the coding tree unit&#x00a0;(CTU) level, which consists of three steps, namely complexity estimation, complexity allocation, and prediction unit&#x00a0;(PU) adaption. In the first step, a complexity estimation model is proposed to estimate the coding complexity of each CTU based on the sum of absolute transformed difference. Then, the complexity budget is allocated to each CTU proportionally to its estimated coding complexity. In PU adaption, only a subset of PU sizes are selected for the CTU according to its allocated complexity and prediction performance. A feedback-based error elimination scheme removes the complexity error during the encoding process. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to adjust the complexity ratio from 100&#x0025; to 20&#x0025;. Meanwhile, the rate-distortion performance and complexity control accuracy of the proposed method are superior to those of the state-of-the-art methods.

For detection and temporal localization, a Teager&#x2013;Kaiser energy operator (TKEO) based method is proposed. For event classification, a time series classification based method using energy similarity measure (ESM) is proposed. The proposed method is tested for simulated multiple event cases in the IEEE-118 bus system using DigSilent/PowerFactory and real PMU data for the Indian grid.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Robot-assisted single port access surgery (SPAS) brings significant benefits to the patients. However, it is challenging due to the limited incision size and requirements in precision, load capacity, and dexterity. To address these challenges, this paper presents a multichannel SPAS robotic system consisting of two channels of 5-degree-of-freedom (DOF) flexible manipulators and an endoscope channel. Each channel of the manipulators is designed based on a 3-DOF parallel mechanism with three sets of super-elastic Ni&#x2013;Ti rods and universal joints. This design optimizes the structure for flexibility and safety considerations with a simplified structure compared with conventional parallel mechanisms. Flexible shafts are used for torque transmission from the actuation unit, allowing the motors to be farther away from the patient-side robotic system. The kinematics of the manipulator is derived, and then the reachable workspace and dexterity are analyzed. Furthermore, a prototype of the proposed robotic system is presented and evaluated through adequate experiments. The flexibility of the manipulator is verified via stiffness characterization test. The results of the accuracy tests confirmed that the robotic system can implement manipulation arm with acceptable accuracy. The feasibility and effectiveness of applying the robotic system to the practical operation are also demonstrated through experimentations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The safety and stability of modern power systems are undergoing various challenges, introduced by the integration of fluctuating renewable generation. In this paper, we present a hierarchical model predictive power dispatch and control strategy for a class of modern power systems with price-elastic controllable loads (CLs) in energy Internet. In the upper-level optimization, a generalized multiperiod economic dispatch (GMPED) problem is organized within an electricity market environment aiming at maximizing the social welfare. Specifically, the price-elastic CLs are aggregated in controllable load aggregators (CLAs) to participate in the market competition. A novel utility function of the price-elastic CLAs is proposed for market demand response. By solving GMPED, the power setpoints of plants over the further periods are produced, as well as the real-time price for the optimal response of price-elastic CLAs. In the second-level operation, two types of model predictive control-based controllers for both the supply and demand sides are designed for power tracking control by considering the model of the power system and aggregated thermostatically controlled loads. Finally, two case studies are performed on the IEEE 14- and 39-bus system, respectively, which shows that the system-frequency deviation and system cost are reduced significantly with the proposed methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this work, the design of a novel the flexure-linked dual-drive H-gantry is first introduced. Compared to conventional stacked X&#x2013;Y tables, the advantages of this gantry are on decoupled X&#x2013;Y actuation, better mechanical reliability, larger driving force, and shorter response time. However, after deriving its reduced-order dynamical model, it is found that the precision of the end-effector is significantly affected by the position dependent torque caused by the inter-parallel-axes driving forces on the fixed inertia frame and coupling forces from the pair of flexures. These form barriers that limit precision positioning and tracking performance over a large workspace. Thus, in the following part, a robust integral of signum of error (RISE) control with novel jerk adaptation is proposed on top of the standard proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and feedforward scheme. Compared with some prior RISE schemes with gain adaptation, the proposed scheme yields bounded robust gain in the presence of noisy velocity estimation. Real-time experiments on the actual testbed indicate that both improvement of motion precision and prevention of resonant mode excitation over a large workspace are successfully achieved in the proposed scheme.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Despite the recent advances on intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings, existing research works mostly assume training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution. However, due to variation of operating condition, domain shift phenomenon generally exists, which results in significant diagnosis performance deterioration. To address cross-domain problems, latest research works preferably apply domain adaptation techniques on marginal data distributions. However, it is usually assumed that sufficient testing data are available for training, that is not in accordance with most transfer tasks in real industries where only data in machine healthy condition can be collected in advance. This paper proposes a novel cross-domain fault diagnosis method based on deep generative neural networks. By artificially generating fake samples for domain adaptation, the proposed method is able to provide reliable cross-domain diagnosis results when testing data in machine fault conditions are not available for training. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method offers a promising approach for industrial applications.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Accurate estimation of power capacity is critical to ensure battery safety margins and optimize energy utilization. Power capacity estimators based on online identified equivalent circuit model have been widely investigated due to the high accuracy and affordable computing cost. However, the impact of noise corruption which is common in practice on such estimators has never been investigated. This paper scrutinizes the effect of noises on model identification, state of charge (SOC) and power capacity estimation. An online model identification method based on adaptive forgetting recursive total least squares (AF-RTLS) is proposed to compensate the noise effect and attenuate the identification bias of model parameters. A Luenberger observer is further used in combination with the AF-RTLS to estimate the SOC in real time. Leveraging the estimated model parameters and SOC, a multiconstraint analytical method is proposed to online estimate the power capacity. Simulation and experimental results verify that the proposed method is superior in terms of estimation accuracy and the robustness to noise corruption.
