<div class="itemdescription">
<p>On Jan 14, 1992, Le Monde published an interview with the French social scientist, Pierre Bourdieu (1930&#8211;2002). Bourdieu drew a distinction between what he called the two hands of the state. The left hand represented those ministries that &#8220;are the trace&#8230;of the social struggles of the past&#8221;&#8212;notably, health and education. The right hand was symbolised by &#8220;the technocrats of the Ministry of Finance&#8221;. Bourdieu had lived through a decade of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, and the influence their policies had had on politicians in France.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The accurate measurement of security metrics is a critical research problem, because an improper or inaccurate measurement process can ruin the usefulness of the metrics. This is a highly challenging problem, particularly when the ground truth is unknown or noisy. In this paper, we measure five malware detection metrics in the absence of ground truth, which is a realistic setting that imposes many technical challenges. The ultimate goal is to develop principled, automated methods for measuring these metrics at the maximum accuracy possible. The problem naturally calls for investigations into statistical estimators by casting the measurement problem as a statistical estimation problem. We propose statistical estimators for these five malware detection metrics. By investigating the statistical properties of these estimators, we characterize when the estimators are accurate, and what adjustments can be made to improve them under what circumstances. We use synthetic data with known ground truth to validate these statistical estimators. Then, we employ these estimators to measure five metrics with respect to a large data set collected from VirusTotal.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Incentive mechanism plays a critical role in privacy-aware crowdsensing. Most previous studies assume a trustworthy fusion center (FC) in their co-design of incentive mechanism and privacy preservation. Very recent work has taken the step to relax the assumption on trustworthy FC and allowed participatory users (PUs) to randomly report their binary sensing data, whereas the focus is to examine PUs&#x2019; equilibrium behavior. Making a paradigm shift, this paper aims to study the privacy compensation for continuous data sensing while allowing FC to directly control PUs. There are two conflicting objectives in such a scenario: FC desires better quality data in order to achieve higher aggregation accuracy whereas PUs prefer injecting larger noises for higher privacy-preserving levels (PPLs). To strike a good balance therein, we propose an efficient incentive mechanism named REAP to reconcile FC&#x2019;s aggregation accuracy and individual PU&#x2019;s data privacy. Specifically, we adopt the celebrated notion of differential privacy to quantify PUs&#x2019; PPLs and characterize their impacts on FC&#x2019;s aggregation accuracy. Then, appealing to contract theory, we design an incentive mechanism to maximize FC&#x2019;s aggregation accuracy under a given budget. The proposed incentive mechanism offers different contracts to PUs with different privacy preferences, by which FC can directly control them. It can further overcome the information asymmetry problem, i.e., FC typically does not know each PU&#x2019;s precise privacy preference. We derive closed-form solutions for the optimal contracts in both complete information and incomplete information scenarios. Further, the results are generalized to the continuous case where PUs&#x2019; privacy preferences take values in a continuous domain. Extensive simulations are provided -
o validate the feasibility and advantages of our proposed incentive mechanism.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Cloud storage platforms promise a convenient way for users to share files and engage in collaborations, yet they require all files to have a single owner who unilaterally makes access control decisions. Existing clouds are, thus, agnostic to the notion of shared ownership. This can be a significant limitation in much collaboration because, for example, one owner can delete files and revoke access without consulting the other collaborators. In this paper, we first formally define a notion of shared ownership within a file access control model. We then propose two possible instantiations of our proposed shared ownership model. Our first solution, called Commune, relies on secure file dispersal and collusion-resistant secret sharing to ensure that all access grants in the cloud require the support of an agreed threshold of owners. As such, Commune can be used in existing clouds without modifications to the platforms. Our second solution, dubbed Comrade, leverages the blockchain technology in order to reach consensus on access control decision. Unlike Commune, Comrade requires that the cloud is able to translate access control decisions that reach consensus in the blockchain into storage access control rules, thus requiring minor modifications to existing clouds. We analyze the security of our proposals and compare/evaluate their performance through implementations using Amazon S3.

<p>Accurate channel state information (CSI) is a key requirement for massive multiple-input multiple-output to achieve multi-fold increases in throughput and secrecy rate. Consequently, an adversary targeting the channel sounding process has the potential to significantly degrade performance. In this paper, we first present and model the pilot distortion attack, a simple but devastating jamming strategy in which the adversary distorts the access point&#x2019;s (AP&#x2019;s) CSI measurement of even a single client leading to denial of service for all clients associated with the AP. We then propose multiple-antenna carrier frequency offset estimate (MACE) as a countermeasure that exploits the AP&#x2019;s antenna array to detect jamming with zero startup cost and zero additional network overhead. Our key insight is that with multiple antennas, the AP&#x2019;s variance estimator of client carrier frequency offset significantly increases when there are jamming signals present. We build a test bed with a 72-antenna AP and collect over 3 000 000 over-the-air transmissions. Our results show that a single-antenna adversary jamming no more than 1/60 of the time and having no more transmit power than any client can cause over 23&#x0025; reduction of achievable rate of all clients. Moreover, by setting a single detection threshold, MACE can achieve 0.97 true positive at 0.01 false positive for various client/adversary locations and for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (5 &#x007e; 35 dB) and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) (&#x2212;5 &#x007e; 35 dB) with SNR &#x2013; SIR  $geq5$  dB.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recently, there has been great interest in feature-based image source identification. Previous statistical learning-based methods usually regarded the identification process as a classification problem. They assumed the dependence of features and the dependence of models. However, the two assumptions are usually problematic because of the genuine coupling of features and models. To address the issues, in this paper, we propose a novel image source identification scheme. For the feature coupling, a coupled feature representation is adopted to analyze the coupled interaction among features. The coupling relations among features and their powers are measured with Pearson&#x2019;s correlations and integrated in a Taylor-like expansion manner. Regarding model coupling, a new coupled probability representation is developed. The model coupling relationships are characterized with conditional probabilities induced by the confusion matrix and then combined with the law of total probability. The experiments carried out on the Dresden image collection confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Via mining the feature coupling and model coupling, the identification accuracy can be significantly improved.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The conventional high-frequency (HF) voltage injection method can accurately extract rotor position for interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drives at low and zero speed ranges. However, the fixed injection frequency will produce a loud audible noise. To solve this problem, a pseudo-random phase-switching fixed-frequency (PRPSFF) signal injection method is proposed in this paper. Based on the principle of phase selection for the PRPSFF injection scheme, the dc bias problem in the induced HF current can be diminished by setting a limitation in the injected voltage. Then a corresponding signal processing method is investigated to deal with the signal delay in the HF current extraction. Besides, the current power spectra density (PSD) for PRPSFF injection is analyzed, and a comparison between PRPSFF and the pseudo-random frequency-switching fixed-phase (PRFSFP) injection schemes is also introduced. The results show that the discrete harmonic spectrum in current PSD can be offset, and the continuous spectrum is smoother than that of PRFSFP injection. Finally, the effectiveness of the sensorless control method is verified by experiments on a 2.2-kW IPMSM drive platform.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Domestic induction cookers are evolving from fixed cooking areas to flexible surfaces in such a way that the pot can be placed at any position. This implies the use of a larger number of reduced-sized inductors, which present a lower efficiency. As a solution to increase the efficiency while maintaining the flexibility, we propose the use of partially overlapped inductors of a larger size. This concept is currently in use in wireless power transfer systems, where the transmitter arrangement consists of several overlapped coils. The aim of this paper is to evaluate this concept applied to domestic induction heating appliances, with special emphasis in analyzing the effects of introducing the multicoil system with dissipative media. Moreover, the losses in the winding will be studied in detail. The system will be prototyped and tested, delivering up to 3.7 kW.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To relieve the tail current effect of insulated-gate bipolar transistors which are preferred in high-power applications, an approach of zero-current-switching (ZCS) for main switches is presented in this paper. Different from the large turn-off current of the main switches of the conventional zero-voltage and zero-current-switching (ZVZCS) full-bridge (FB) dc-dc converter, small turn-off current of auxiliary circuit is introduced to achieve ZCS for main switches, where the auxiliary circuit also delivers a small portion power and can realize ZVZCS. Hence, high efficiency can be achieved with the switching loss lowered remarkably. Furthermore, a hybrid resonant FB dc-dc converter is proposed, the operation principle and parameters design rules of which are analyzed in detail. A 200 V-2 kV/3 kW experimental platform has been built to verify the feasibility and performance of the proposed ZCS approach, as well as the proposed converter.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In order to increase the operation safety of the railway vehicles, including subways, tramways, and all other types of the trains running on the railroads, it is necessary to inspect the status of them frequently. A key parameter in inspection of railway vehicles is the wheel diameter as well as its profile and overall geometry. The diameter of a wheel decreases during operation due to wear. Any difference between diameters of the wheels in a bogie frame or in a car body should be in an allowable range specified by the railway technical standards. It is also vital to utilize a system for continuous checking of the wheel diameter to prevent train derailment. A new measurement system based on the image processing is proposed to perform the diameter measurement in a reliable manner in this paper. Traditional measurement systems are usually based on the mechanical devices and are unreliable and sometimes expensive due to the need for a perfect physical contact and consequent precise mechanical components. The proposed system is based on the modification of three-point radius measurement technique. The appropriate image processing is developed to decrease the steps in conventional third point calculation to gain time saving and fast operation. It is shown that this approach is an efficient technique for high-accuracy wheel diameter measurement. Experimental results show capability of the system for industrial use.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Synchronous motors are reliable and efficient, but it is relatively difficult to start them. In some cases, a variable frequency drive is utilized. In some other, asynchronous start is achieved by virtue of induced currents in a solid rotor, or a rotor damper cage installed for this purpose. In this contribution, a method to start a synchronous machine without a damper cage is presented. The starting was achieved by inverting the polarity of the rotor field winding in a timely manner with respect to the rotating stator field. The technique was verified with experiments performed on a 200 kVA experimental test rig and also simulated on a 20 MVA machine.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a recently developed technique to perfectly address the energy problem for smart city sensors that do not have a readily wired power supply. In a radio-frequency-powered wireless communication system, sensors first harvest energy via the radio-frequency WPT, and then, transmit sensed data to the receiver. The &#x201c;harvest-then-transmit&#x201d; protocol is used to coordinate the two operations, in which we wish to optimally decide when to harvest energy, when to transmit data, and what transmission rate should be used such that the data are maximally transmitted. Unlike existing works, we assumed that the wireless transferred power is dynamically changing, instead of being constant, which is more realistic in green smart city applications, e.g., Industry 4.0 workshop, smart transportation, and smart buildings, where environments are continuously changing, so the wireless transferred power is affected dynamically. In this paper, we present an optimal scheduling algorithm for the offline case where the varying WPT is known in advance. Based on the optimal principles learned from the offline case, we have designed an efficient online algorithm. Finally, we report our simulation results that demonstrate that our online scheduling algorithm can adaptively and efficiently achieve high data throughput.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To apply cyber-physical system (CPS) technique in industrial internet, a wireless technology that is able to robustly maintain hyperconnectivity between a data center and distributed user entities and/or industrial Internet of Things devices is required. We investigate the feasibility of utilizing massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) as such a wireless technology. We analyze the performance of a massive MIMO base station deployed at a data center to provide massive connectivity to a large number of devices. In addition, we discuss related research challenges for deploying massive MIMO in industrial internet applications of CPS, such as device scheduling and power control, energy efficient design and radio frequency energy transfer/harvesting, signaling techniques for drones and mobile robots, and applications of underwater industrial internet.

<p>The papers in this special section focus on information technology in industrial automation applications. Information technologies play a crucial role in the current and future developments of industrial automation. There are numerous strategic agendas on future manufacturing that have appeared recently worldwide and all of them emphasize the role of information technologies in automation in shaping up the future of production industries. For example, according to the German development agenda Industrie 4.0, the main driving force of the new industrial revolution is the Internet of things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The IoT concept is becoming a major driver for many industrial applications. In manufacturing, it leads to flattening of the control pyramid, thus, increasing flexibility and enabling unprecedented level of production flexibility and adaptability, making it possible and feasible to produce products in smaller amounts, with shorter time to markets and higher economic efficiency. In the manufacturing environment, CPS comprise smart machines, storage systems, and production facilities capable of autonomously exchanging information, triggering actions, and controlling each other independently. The research community effort has been focusing on systems interoperability, performance, and efficiency of the design process, as well as assurance in the correctness of systems behavior.

<p><span class="paragraphSection"><strong>To the Editor</strong> The Viewpoint by Dr Massetti and colleagues emphasized the link between obesity and cancer and called for more robust clinical intervention to prevent and treat obesity. The authors proposed that sustainable weight loss be achieved by comprehensive strategies that support patients&#8217; efforts to make significant lifestyle changes. However, most published studies have shown that the long-term success rate of lifestyle changes is low. Although lifestyle changes may be sufficient to reduce body weight prior to sustained obesity, once obesity is established, body weight seems to become biologically fixed and lifestyle programs become less effective.</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p><span class="paragraphSection">Whenever we are charged, as a nation, with being occupied solely with the life of trade, and the designation of Yankee is used to designate preeminently commercial habits, it is refreshing to turn to the history of science for the truth. Of course, in the earlier days of the United States as a national enterprise the conditions were scarcely favorable for the widespread prosecution of those studies for which the European peoples of the civilized world had been prepared by generations and even centuries of experience. America&#8217;s intellectual life can at best be measured by decades. How has she progressed in some of the more recently recognized intellectual disciplines? The new science of bacteriology, the outcome of the labors of Pasteur, Lister, Koch and others, was born within the memory of many that are still living. The bacillus of tuberculosis was announced in 1882; the vibrio of Asiatic cholera in 1883; the bacilli of lockjaw and of diphtheria in 1884, the same year that marked the better recognition of the typhoid bacillus, which was really discovered in 1879; in 1894 came the discovery of the bacillus of bubonic plague; and along with this period belongs the finding of the micro-organisms of malaria, sleeping sickness, and several other diseases. In the midst of such developments the newer science of parasitology has found a firmer footing and a novel significance.</span>
