</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In applications that demand single-input dual-output (SIDO) or dual-input single-output (DISO) dc&#x2013;dc converters, employing two separate single-input single-output (SISO) converters is a solution. However, the number of components is doubled, resulting in high overall cost. In order to reduce costs, this paper proposes a novel topology synthesis methodology, with which a variety of SIDO and DISO dc&#x2013;dc converters with reduced components can be derived. The principle of topology synthesis states that integrated SIDO and DISO dc&#x2013;dc converters can be easily developed from conventional SISO converters by replacing a diode with a basic cell inclusive of additional input/output port. The principle is effective for many SISO dc&#x2013;dc converters, and as an example, topology synthesis based on buck, boost, buck&#x2013;boost, Cuk, sepic, and zeta SISO converters is performed in this paper. In order to achieve better understanding of the proposed converters, the integrated SIDO Cuk converter is specifically analyzed and experimentally verified. In comparison with the conventional scheme of two separate SISO Cuk converters, good cross regulation is retained while the number of diodes, inductors, and capacitors is reduced in the proposed SIDO Cuk converter. In addition, zero-voltage-switching operation of one switch is achieved, contributing to lower switching losses. Finally, a prototype circuit with 48-V input and 156&#x00a0;V/1&#x00a0;A, 24&#x00a0;V/4&#x00a0;A outputs is built to validate the theoretical analysis.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a robust coupled multiple sliding-mode control (CMSMC) method for tracking control of underactuated hovercraft systems with nonholonomic constraints and external disturbances. First, a friction model for the hovercraft, one of the main disturbance factors, is proposed by considering viscosity, and its validity is demonstrated through experiments. Second, a disturbance model in the actual hovercraft system is estimated using a least-square-estimation-based disturbance observer. Third, pseudo forces and pseudo heading direction angle for tracking control and disturbance compensation are proposed considering the characteristics of underactuated hovercraft systems. Fourth, coupled multiple sliding surfaces (CMSSs) are newly introduced in terms of the tracking errors between the pseudo control variables and actual ones, and then, a CMSMC-based controller is proposed so that the CMSSs converge to zero within finite time in the case of zero disturbance estimation errors. In this way, three posture variables of the hovercraft converge to reference ones using only two control inputs. Finally, stability analysis and verification by simulations and experiments show that both the pseudo control tracking errors and posture tracking errors are ultimately bounded and asymptotically converge to zero when disturbance estimation errors become zero.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>As for ripple-current mode control, it cannot achieve average current tracking, resulting in poor current accuracy and even current waveform distortion. Meanwhile, fast-scale instability may occur in some operating conditions. To solve these problems effectively, a current-ripple compensation (CRC) control technique is proposed in this paper. The error between the average of the controlled current and the reference current is compensated by certain compensation signal, achieving average current tracking while suppressing fast-scale instability. On this basis, the compensator in the outer-voltage loop is further simplified to a proportional part by introducing a rebuilt average reference current. The idea and design procedure of the proposed CRC control technique are discussed in detail. Accordingly, two available implementation schemes for the proposed CRC are presented, including slope compensated and parabolic compensated schemes. Finally, two application cases, respectively, to dc&#x2013;dc Buck converter and Boost PFC converter, are presented to verify the proposed CRC control technique.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Both response time and reliability are important functional safety properties that must be simultaneously satisfied learning from the automotive functional safety standard ISO 26262. Safety verification pertains to checking if an application meets a safe set of design specifications and complies with regulations. Introducing verification in the early design phase not only complies with the latest automotive functional safety standard but also avoids unnecessary design effort or reduces the design burden of the late design optimization phase. This study presents a fast functional safety verification (FFSV) method for a distributed automotive application during the early design phase. The first method FFSV1 finds the solution with the minimum response time under the reliability requirement, and the second method FFSV2 finds the solution with the maximum reliability under the response time requirement. We combine FFSV1 and FFSV2 to create union FFSV (UFFSV), which can obtain acceptance ratios higher than those of current methods. Experiments on real-life and synthetic distributed automotive applications show that UFFSV can obtain higher acceptance ratios than their existing counterparts.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Privacy-preserving data aggregation has been extensively studied in smart grid. However, almost all existing schemes aggregate the total electricity consumption data of the whole user set, which sometimes cannot meet the fine-grained demands from control center in smart grid. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving multisubset data aggregation scheme, named PPMA, in smart grid. PPMA can aggregate users&#x2019; electricity consumption data of different ranges, while guaranteeing the privacy of individual users. Detailed security analysis shows that PPMA can protect individual user&#x0027;s electricity consumption privacy against a strong adversary. In addition, extensive experiments results demonstrate that PPMA has less computation overhead and no more extra communication and storage costs.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Home energy management (HEM) systems enable residential consumers to participate in demand response programs (DRPs) more actively. However, HEM systems confront some practical difficulties due to the uncertainty related to renewable energies as well as the uncertainty of consumers&#x2019; behavior. Moreover, the consumers aim for the highest level of comfort and satisfaction in operating their electrical appliances. In addition, technical limits of the appliances must be considered. Furthermore, DR providers aim at keeping the participation of consumers in DRPs and minimize the &#x201c;response fatigue&#x201d; phenomenon in the long-term period. In this paper, a stochastic model of an HEM system is proposed by considering uncertainties of electric vehicles availability and small-scale renewable energy generation. The model optimizes the customer&#x0027;s cost in different DRPs, while guarantees the inhabitants&#x2019; satisfaction by introducing a response fatigue index. Different case studies indicate that the implementation of the proposed stochastic HEM system can considerably decrease both the customers&#x2019; cost and response fatigue.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Since operating conditions of power systems always change, the input and output signals of wide-area damping controller (WADC), which are selected at an operating point, may not be able to guarantee the damping effect at other operating points. This paper focuses on a new adaptive signal selection for WADC against several operating conditions, such as various load demands, control signal failure, line and generator outages, and effect of communication latency. The joint controllability and observability is used to determine the best input and output pairs of WADC at any operating points. Small-signal and transient stabilities study in the IEEE 50-machine system including renewable sources, i.e., wind and solar photovoltaic generators are conducted to evaluate the effect of the proposed method. Study result demonstrates that the WADC with the adaptive signal selection yields superior damping effect to the WADC with the fixed signal selection over wide range operations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>When single-loop inverter-side current control is used in the LCL-type inverters, there may be more than one stable region with regard to computation delay in control path. The system is stable if computation delay is small enough, but it, named as the first stable region, may be too narrow to finish the control codes in high-frequency system. On the other hand, the second stable region is highly sensitive to the grid impedance variation and is hardly applicable in weak grids. To deal with the situation, this paper investigates the influence of the capacitor voltage feedforward on the system stability considering flexible computation delay in feedforward path. It is found that the capacitor voltage feedforward is able to suppress the resonance of the LCL filter. However, a new resonance may arise if computation delay is not carefully handled. The influence of computation delay in both forward path and feedforward path on system stability is systematically analyzed. The analytical results show that after applying feedforward control with optimized delay, the system stability is greatly improved and is not sensitive to the grid impedance variation. The simulation and experiment results verify the analytical results.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the widespread adoption of Internet of Things and cloud computing in different industry sectors, an increasing number of individuals or organizations are outsourcing their Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) data in the cloud server to achieve cost saving and collaboration (e.g., data sharing). However, in this environment, preserving the privacy of data remains a key challenge and inhibiting factor to an even wider adoption of IIoT in the cloud environment. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we design a new secure channel-free certificateless searchable public key encryption with multiple keywords scheme for IIoT deployment. We then demonstrate the security of the scheme in the random oracle model against two types of adversaries, where one adversary is given the power to choose a random public key instead of any user&#x0027;s public key and another adversary is allowed to learn the system master key. In the presence of these types of adversaries, we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme and demonstrate that it achieves (computational) efficiency with low communication cost.

<p><span class="paragraphSection">Journal peer review is often time-consuming, arduous, and fraught with suspicion, not least because the identities of reviewers usually remain hidden from the authors. Despite these flaws, and the fundamental problem that the efficiency and effectiveness of peer review have yet to be measured satisfactorily, authors, editors, reviewers, and readers have become comfortable with it. Editors like anointing colleagues as experts, reviewers appreciate peer review because it tends to confirm their own impressions of themselves as experts, and no one has created a better system to vet the validity of scientific reports. Authors may complain but also may be grateful for expert appraisal and criticism and subsequent improvement in their manuscripts. They realize that their work has been taken seriously and recognize that the incorporation of reviewers democratizes beyond the editor this part of the scientific enterprise. Readers feel assured that articles have been evaluated by experts, and the public at large, imagining a much deeper degree of scrutiny than is customary or possible, assumes that articles that are published in most peer-reviewed journals have passed some universal standard of quality.</span>
