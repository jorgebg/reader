<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The paper presents a dictionary integration algorithm using 3D morphable face models (3DMM) for pose-invariant collaborative-representation-based face classification. To this end, we first fit a 3DMM to the 2D face images of a dictionary to reconstruct the 3D shape and texture of each image. The 3D faces are used to render a number of virtual 2D face images with arbitrary pose variations to augment the training data, by merging the original and rendered virtual samples to create an extended dictionary. Second, to reduce the information redundancy of the extended dictionary and improve the sparsity of reconstruction coefficient vectors using collaborative-representation-based classification (CRC), we exploit an on-line class elimination scheme to optimise the extended dictionary by identifying the training samples of the most representative classes for a given query. The final goal is to perform pose-invariant face classification using the proposed dictionary integration method and the on-line pruning strategy under the CRC framework. Experimental results obtained for a set of well-known face data sets demonstrate the merits of the proposed method, especially its robustness to pose variations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a new channel training (CT) scheme for a full-duplex receiver to enhance physical layer security. Equipped with  $N_{B}$  full-duplex antennas, the receiver simultaneously receives the information signal and transmits artificial noise (AN). In order to reduce the non-cancellable self-interference due to the transmitted AN, the receiver has to estimate the self-interference channel prior to the data communication phase. In the proposed CT scheme, the receiver transmits a limited number of pilot symbols that are known only to itself. Such a secret CT scheme prevents an eavesdropper from estimating the jamming channel from the receiver to the eavesdropper, hence effectively degrading the eavesdropping capability. We analytically examine the connection probability (i.e., the probability of the data being successfully decoded by the receiver) of the legitimate channel and the secrecy outage probability due to eavesdropping for the proposed secret CT scheme. Based on our analysis, the optimal power allocation between CT and data/AN transmission at the legitimate transmitter/receiver is determined. Our examination shows that the newly proposed secret CT scheme significantly outperforms the non-secret CT scheme that uses publicly known pilots when the number of antennas at the eavesdropper is larger than one.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Radio frequency identification (RFID) has been considered one of the imperative requirements for implementation of Internet-of-Things applications. It helps to solve the identification issues of the things in a cost-effective manner, but RFID systems often suffer from various security and privacy issues. To solve those issues for RFID systems, many schemes have been recently proposed by using the cryptographic primitive, called physically uncloneable functions (PUFs), which can ensure a tamper-evident feature. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them has succeeded to address the problem of privacy preservation with the resistance of DoS attacks in a practical way. For instance, existing schemes need to rely on exhaustive search operations to identify a tag, and also suffer from several security and privacy related issues. Furthermore, a tag needs to store some security credentials (e.g., secret shared keys), which may cause several issues such as loss of forward and backward secrecy and large storage costs. Therefore, in this paper, we first propose a lightweight privacy-preserving authentication protocol for the RFID system by considering the ideal PUF environment. Subsequently, we introduce an enhanced protocol which can support the noisy PUF environment. It is argued that both of our protocols can overcome the limitations of existing schemes, and further ensure more security properties. By analyzing the performance, we have shown that the proposed solutions are secure, efficient, practical, and effective for the resource-constraint RFID tag.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Simple password exponential key exchange (SPEKE) is a well-known password authenticated key exchange protocol that has been used in Blackberry phones for secure messaging and Entrust&#x2019;s TruePass end-to-end web products. It has also been included into international standards such as ISO/IEC 11770-4 and IEEE P1363.2. In this paper, we analyze the SPEKE protocol as specified in the ISO/IEC and IEEE standards. We identify that the protocol is vulnerable to two new attacks: an impersonation attack that allows an attacker to impersonate a user without knowing the password by launching two parallel sessions with the victim, and a key-malleability attack that allows a man-in-the-middle to manipulate the session key without being detected by the end users. Both attacks have been acknowledged by the technical committee of ISO/IEC SC 27 and ISO/IEC 11770-4 revised as a result. We propose a patched SPEKE called P-SPEKE and present a formal analysis in the Applied Pi Calculus using ProVerif to show that the proposed patch prevents both attacks. The proposed patch has been included into the latest revision of ISO/IEC 11770-4 published in 2017.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The key-leakage-storage region is derived for a generalization of a classic two-terminal key agreement model. The additions to the model are that the encoder observes a hidden, or noisy, version of the identifier, and that the encoder and decoder can perform multiple measurements. To illustrate the behavior of the region, the theory is applied to binary identifiers and noise modeled via binary symmetric channels. In particular, the key-leakage-storage region is simplified by applying Mrs. Gerber&#x2019;s lemma twice in different directions to a Markov chain. The growth in the region as the number of measurements increases is quantified. The amount by which the privacy-leakage rate reduces for a hidden identifier as compared to a noise-free (visible) identifier at the encoder is also given. If the encoder incorrectly models the source as visible, it is shown that substantial secrecy leakage may occur and the reliability of the reconstructed key might decrease.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Domestic induction cookers are evolving from fixed cooking areas to flexible surfaces in such a way that the pot can be placed at any position. This implies the use of a larger number of reduced-sized inductors, which present a lower efficiency. As a solution to increase the efficiency while maintaining the flexibility, we propose the use of partially overlapped inductors of a larger size. This concept is currently in use in wireless power transfer systems, where the transmitter arrangement consists of several overlapped coils. The aim of this paper is to evaluate this concept applied to domestic induction heating appliances, with special emphasis in analyzing the effects of introducing the multicoil system with dissipative media. Moreover, the losses in the winding will be studied in detail. The system will be prototyped and tested, delivering up to 3.7 kW.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel nonisolated single-input dual-output three-level dc&#x2013;dc converter (SIDO-TLC) appropriate for medium- and high-voltage applications. The SIDO-TLC is an integration of the three-level buck and boost converters, whose output voltages are regulated simultaneously. Reducing voltage stress across semiconductor devices, improving efficiency, and reducing inductors size are among the main merits of the new topology. Moreover, due to the considerably reduced volume of the step-down filter capacitor, a small film capacitor can be used instead, whose advantages are lower equivalent series resistance and a longer lifespan. A closed-loop control system has been designed based on a small-signal model derivation in order to regulate the output voltages along with the capacitors&#x2019; voltage balancing. In order to verify the theoretical and simulation results, a 300-W prototype was built and experimented. The results prove the aforementioned advantages of the SIDO-TLC, and the high effectiveness of the balancing control strategy. Furthermore, the converter shows very good stability, even under simultaneous step changes of the loads and input voltage.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>For parameter identifications of robot systems, most existing works have focused on the estimation veracity, but few works of literature are concerned with the convergence speed. In this paper, we developed a robot control/identification scheme to identify the unknown robot kinematic and dynamic parameters with enhanced convergence rate. Superior to the traditional methods, the information of parameter estimation error was properly integrated into the proposed identification algorithm, such that enhanced estimation performance was achieved. Besides, the Newton&#x2013;Euler (NE) method was used to build the robot dynamic model, where a singular value decomposition-based model reduction method was designed to remedy the potential singularity problems of the NE regressor. Moreover, an interval excitation condition was employed to relax the requirement of persistent excitation condition for the kinematic estimation. By using the Lyapunov synthesis, explicit analysis of the convergence rate of the tracking errors and the estimated parameters were performed. Simulation studies were conducted to show the accurate and fast convergence of the proposed finite-time (FT) identification algorithm based on a 7-DOF arm of Baxter robot.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper addresses the mean-square finite-time bounded control problem for uncertain stochastic systems via a sliding mode approach. The stochastic phenomena of randomly occurring uncertainties and randomly varying actuator faults modeled by two independent exponential distributions are addressed effectively. A key issue for the system under the consideration is how to ensure, for any prescribed finite (possibly short) working time interval, the stochastic finite-time boundedness (SFTB) of the resultant closed-loop systems and the reachability of the specified sliding surface in mean-square sense. To this end, a parameter-dependent sliding mode control (SMC) law is designed to force (with probability one) the state trajectories into a domain around the specified sliding surface during the given finite-time interval. The upper bound of the sliding domain associated with the design parameters is obtained explicitly. The sufficient conditions are established, respectively, for guaranteeing the SFTB of the SMC systems over both reaching phase and sliding motion phase. Finally, the proposed finite-time SMC approach is illustrated via a parallel active suspension system.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a three-level quasi-switched boost T-type inverter (3L qSBT<sup>2</sup>I) is proposed. A new pulse-width modulated (PWM) control method is presented to reduce the inductor current ripple of the qSBT<sup>2</sup> I. In the introduced PWM technique, the shoot-through duty cycle is maintained constant to keep the modulation index as high as possible. Then, the only control parameters of the qSBT<sup>2</sup>I are the duty cycles of the two additional switches. By controlling the duty cycles of the two additional switches, the voltage gain of the proposed qSBT<sup>2 </sup>I can be improved to a value larger than that of the conventional 3L impedance source inverters. The steady-state analysis, operating principles, and comparisons with the impedance source-based 3L inverters are presented. A 1-kW prototype is constructed to verify the operating principle of the 3L qSBT<sup>2</sup>I. An indirect dc-link voltage regulator and a capacitor voltage-balance controller are applied to the proposed qSBT<sup>2</sup>I. Simulation and experimental results are presented.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Organizing sensor nodes into a clustered architecture is an effective method for load balancing and prolonging the network lifetime. However, a serious drawback of the clustering approach is the imposed energy overhead caused by the &#x201c;global&#x201d; clustering operations in every round of the global round-based policy (GRBP). To mitigate this problem, this paper proposes a hierarchical clustering-task scheduling policy (HCSP), which triggers node-driven clustering as opposed to GRBP's time-driven clustering. Based on HCSP, each cluster is reconfigured only once at each local super round. Therefore, the cluster reconfiguration frequency varies on-demand and may differ from one cluster to another throughout the network lifetime. However, in order to refresh the entire network structure, global clustering is performed at the end of every global hyper round. Accordingly, HCSP aims to achieve a more flexible, energy-efficient, and scalable clustering-task scheduling than that of GRBP. This policy mitigates the clustering overhead, which is the worst disadvantage of clustering approaches. Energy consumption calculations and extensive simulations show the effectiveness of HCSP in saving energy and in prolonging the network lifetime.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents the characterization of network delays in an IEC61850 process bus substation area network, both through theoretical analysis and simulations. Several design targets were defined considering the recommendations of standards and good design practices: number of network hops, total network delay, probability of the delay being exceeded, link load, network topology and availability. An analytical delay estimation methodology is proposed, considering both the steady-state traffic and traffic resulting from a breaker failure event. A complete substation is taken as an example for characterizing the network delays, considering a star network topology. Simulations allow to obtain the cumulative distribution functions and percentile values of network delays. Results show a good agreement between the simulation and the analytical analysis. While the delay is best characterized statistically through simulation, finding the maximum network delay through simulations can be very time consuming, making the analytical analysis more suitable.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The availability of performance studies and simple models for firewalls able to deal with industrial application-layer communication protocols, such as Modbus/TCP, is crucial when the impact of these devices has to be estimated, even roughly, before their actual deployment in industrial networks. Unfortunately, most manufacturers do not provide this kind of information for commercial off-the-shelf available products. Thus, a viable solution is the development and experimental validation of simple models that can be used by designers to predict those firewall characteristics not explicitly related to their security capabilities. As an example, latency introduced on message forwarding is an aspect of significant interest in many industrial control systems, where delays and jitters in data delivery can severely impact on the effectiveness of the control actions. This paper reports on our experience in developing a performance model for a commercial device able to perform advanced application-layer filtering, in particular of Modbus/TCP traffic. A set of ad hoc designed experiments, performed by means of a purposely developed laboratory testbed, enabled both model development and validation, confirming a good correspondence of the estimated performance with the device actual behavior.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>There are major discussions about the vulnerability of protocols based on real-time Ethernet (RTE) and techniques for detecting anomalies. Thus, this work proposes a methodology for detecting anomalies by optimizing the data extraction and by classifying traffic-related features. In order to cope with this proposal, an artificial neural network (ANN)-based classifier is trained using selected relevant features. These features are extracted using variable sized sliding window and selected according to their correlation with the other features and the expected output of the classifier. The number of relevant features can vary according to performance indicators of the classifier. The proposed methodology was exploited for identifying four different events of PROFINET networks. The performance of the ANN-based classifier was considered successful for all cases. This outcome suggests that the proposed methodology may be successful for anomalies detection in any PROFINET network. However, the application of the proposed methodology to other RTE protocol is foreseen.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Industrial control systems are foreseen to operate over hybrid wired/wireless networks. While the controller will be deployed in the wired network, sensors and actuators will be deployed in a wireless sensor network (WSN). To support QoS for control systems, an end-to-end delay bound and a target reliability must be provided in both wireless and wired domains. However, for industrial WSNs, guaranteeing reliability is a challenging task because of low-power communications and the harsh wireless environment. In this work, we present the first QoS framework for arbitrary hybrid wired/wireless networks, which guarantees that the delay bound and the target reliability of each application are provided. As part of this framework, we propose the first reliability-based scheduler for WSN able to achieve a target reliability in the presence of dynamic interference. Simulations of the proposed scheduler prove its suitability in different interference scenarios and motivate further work.

<p>Immunotherapies targeting immune checkpoints such as CTLA4, PDCD1 (PD-1), and CD274 (PD-L1) have revolutionised oncology.1 High-level microsatellite instability (MSI-high) caused by mismatch repair deficiency is routinely used as a biomarker to predict response to immune-checkpoint blockade.2 MSI-high status in colorectal carcinoma correlates with tumour neoantigen loads, which in turn correlate with immune response.3 Combined analysis of tumoural and immune factors (eg, the so-called Tumour Immunity in the MicroEnvironment [TIME] classification) could be a new cancer classification system.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>As the world unites to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) and we strive to measure, adopt, adapt, and account for progress, awareness of the most basic of health-care needs and intrinsic goals of health systems has been obliterated: the prevention and alleviation of suffering. Suffering is a state of distress that manifests in physical, psychological, social, and spiritual forms.1 The alleviation of suffering&#8212;reducing the pain of debriding a wound or easing the symptoms of a cancer patient&#8212;is a core component of medicine and public health.

<p>On March 6, 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorised the DNA testing company 23andMe's Personal Genome Service that offers mail-order testing for selected variants of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer genes.1 This service analyses DNA from a self-collected sample of saliva, and results are available through an online portal. The subsequent report may determine whether an individual is at an increased risk of developing several cancers linked to these gene mutations, including breast, ovarian, fallopian tube, peritoneal, prostate, and pancreatic cancer.

<p>We read the Article by David Montaigne and colleagues1 with interest and congratulate them for their impressive study. The study investigated whether Rev-Erb&#945;-induced circadian variation of ischaemia&#8211;reperfusion tolerance exists. This investigation was done by taking atrial trabeculae samples from patients who had undergone aortic valve replacement, operated on in the morning or afternoon, before cardiopulmonary bypass. The samples were then exposed to in-vitro ischaemia&#8211;reperfusion injury. Additionally, a Langendorff model, using the hearts of Rev-Erb&#945; knockout mice that were exposed to either ischaemia&#8211;reperfusion alone or after treatment with a Rev-Erb&#945; antagonist, showed that the hearts were rescued from the inhibitory effect of Rev-Erb&#945; on cardioprotective transcription factors and were therefore able to regain ischaemia&#8211;reperfusion tolerance.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Over the past four decades, rapid urbanisation in China has brought unprecedented health benefits to its urban population, but has also created new challenges for protection of and promotion of health in cities. With the shift from rural to urban living, more people than ever enjoy the health advantages that cities can provide, such as better access to health services and improved sanitation. For example, the average life expectancy of male urban residents in 2010 was estimated to be 7&#183;09 years longer than that of of their counterparts in rural China; urban females lived 6&#183;64 years longer.
