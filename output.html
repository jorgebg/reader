</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Active authentication (AA) refers to the problem of continuously verifying the identity of a mobile device user for the purpose of securing the device. We address the problem of quickly detecting intrusions with lower false detection rates in mobile AA systems with higher resource efficiency. Bayesian and MiniMax versions of the quickest change detection (QCD) algorithms are introduced to quickly detect intrusions in mobile AA systems. These algorithms are extended with an update rule to facilitate low-frequency sensing which leads to low utilization of resources. Effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated using three publicly available unconstrained face and touch gesture-based AA datasets. It is shown that the proposed QCD-based intrusion detection methods can perform better than many state-of-the-art AA methods in terms of latency and low false detection rates. Furthermore, it is shown that employing the proposed resource-efficient extension further improves the performance of the QCD-based setup.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A collaborative security detection method is investigated for the Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Consensus protocol is utilized to implement the information sharing and fusion in a collaborative manner. A game theoretical analysis framework is developed for the collaborative security detection by considering the confrontation between the defender and the attacker. The objective is to achieve the maximum security protection for the entire IoT systems. The existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium of game model with complete consensus are analyzed. Then an iteration learning based calculation method is presented to determine the Nash equilibrium. Quantitative analysis is provided for the relationship between the Nash equilibriums of the game models in the cases of complete and incomplete consensus with infinite and finite number of iterations. Simulation results by considering DDoS attack are also provided to verify our theoretical results.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Craniofacial superimposition (CFS) is a forensic identification technique, which studies the anatomical and morphological correspondence between a skull and a face. It involves the process of overlaying a variable number of facial images with the skull. This technique has great potential, since nowadays a wide majority of people have photographs, where their faces are clearly visible. In addition, the skull is a bone that hardly degrades under the effect of fire, humidity, temperature changes, and so on. Three consecutive stages for the CFS process have been distinguished: the acquisition and processing of the materials, the skull-face overlay, and the decision making. This final stage consists of determining the degree of support for a match based on the previous overlays. The final decision is guided by different criteria depending on the anatomical relations between the skull and the face. In previous approaches, we proposed a framework for automating this stage at different levels, taking into consideration all the information and uncertainty sources involved. In this paper, we model new anatomical skull-face regions and tackle the last level of the hierarchical decision support system. For the first time, we present a complete system, which provides a final degree of craniofacial correspondence. Furthermore, we validate our system as an automatic identification tool analyzing its capabilities in closed (known information or a potential list of those involved) and open lists (little or no idea at first who may be involved) and comparing its performance with the manual results achieved by experts, obtaining a remarkable performance. The proposed system has been demonstrated to be valid for sort-listing a given data set of initial candidates (in 62.5&#x0025; of the cases, the positive one is ranked in the first position) and to serve as an exclusion method (97.4&#x0025; and 96&#x0025; of true negatives in training and test, res-
ectively).

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Local feature points have been widely employed in robust image fingerprinting. One of their intrinsic advantages is their invariance under geometric transforms. However, their robustness against certain attacks that modify the positions of points, such as additive noising and blurring, is limited. In addition, local-feature-point-based approaches ignore the distribution of the feature points. In this paper, we harness feature point relationships, including local structures and global relevance, to overcome these limitations. In the relationship mining strategy, Delaunay triangulation is first applied to the feature points to capture their geometric structures. Subsequently, local structures are represented by searching for an independent set in the mapping graph constructed via Delaunay triangulation, whereas the global relevance is represented by the Laplacian of the graph. Finally, the local structures and global relevance are used as input to the quantization process of the image fingerprinting system. In the process of quantization, we propose an unsupervised quantization strategy called between-cluster distance-based quantization to preserve the neighborhood structure between the binary fingerprint space and the original feature space. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves effective performance under common modifications.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We present the design and manufacturing of high-fidelity universal 3D fingerprint targets, which can be imaged on a variety of fingerprint sensing technologies, namely, capacitive, contact optical, and contactless optical. Universal 3D fingerprint targets enable, for the first time, not only a repeatable and controlled evaluation of fingerprint readers but also the ability to conduct fingerprint reader interoperability studies. Fingerprint reader interoperability refers to how robust fingerprint recognition systems are to variations in the images acquired by different types of fingerprint readers. To build universal 3D fingerprint targets, we adopt a molding and casting framework consisting of: 1) digital mapping of fingerprint images to a negative mold; 2) CAD modeling a scaffolding system to hold the negative mold; 3) fabricating the mold and scaffolding system with a high resolution 3D printer; 4) producing or mixing a material with similar electrical, optical, and mechanical properties to that of the human finger; and 5) fabricating a 3D fingerprint target using controlled casting. Our experiments conducted with personal identity verification and Appendix F certified optical (contact and contactless) and capacitive fingerprint readers demonstrate the usefulness of universal 3D fingerprint targets for controlled and repeatable fingerprint reader evaluations and also fingerprint reader interoperability studies.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper introduces a novel boundary conduction mode (BCM) controlled microconverter for photovoltaic (PV) application in order to provide high conversion efficiency over a wide input voltage operating range. Within the wide input range for the PV panel, there is no need to change the operating modes according to the PV panel voltage. The leakage inductance current can work in BCM with fixed switching frequency. The operation mode analysis is given first. Then, the operating principle of the proposed BCM and its implementation are introduced. Loss breakdown of the prototype using GaN devices is analyzed and compared with the same voltage-rating silicon mosfets. A 300-W microconverter was fabricated and experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed BCM control.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Generally, the modal degeneration problem existed in the design of ultrasonic motors using composite vibration modes can be overcome by adopting the same-order orthogonal-bending composite vibrations. The conventional excitation and the modified hybrid one of sandwich type orthogonal-bending composite vibrations with the same order are compared and analyzed in this paper. Compared with the conventional one, the modified hybrid excitation favors that two groups of ceramics exciting two orthogonal-bending modes are placed in the optimum excitation position. Moreover, the modified hybrid excitation can achieve larger vibration amplitude than the conventional one, while the amount of the ceramics adopted and the exciting voltages applied are the same. The first-order orthogonal-bending composite vibrations are chosen to analyze the advantage of the modified hybrid excitation. Finite-element method is adopted to compare the amplitudes of the models with the same sizes but different excitations. The prototypes corresponding to two excitations are fabricated and tested to verify the results of the theory and simulation. It is proved that the modified hybrid excitation can improve the performance of the sandwich type ultrasonic motors using bending composite vibrations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper aims to provide a clear explanation of the role of the footprint of uncertainty (FOU) parameters on the control signal generation and, thus, to increase the interpretability of specially structured interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy logic controllers, namely single input IT2 fuzzy PID (SI-IT2-FPID) controller. In this context, we extend the analysis performed for SI-IT2-FPID controllers by providing the effect of the FOU parameters on control surface (CS) generation. We show that, by only adjusting a single parameter that shapes the FOU, it is possible to generate commonly employed CSs without a requirement of an optimization assistance. In order to validate our theoretical analysis, we present comparative real world quadcopter flight tests. The real-time experimental results show that the SI-IT2-FPID controller can achieve better control performance in the presence of uncertainties and strong wind conditions when compared to its type-1 and conventional counterparts. We believe that the results of this study will open the doors to a wider use of SI-IT2-FPID controllers in real world control applications as the proposed structure is easy to design and feasible to deploy, especially in real-time control systems.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A common ground switched-quasi-Z-source bidirectional dc&#x2013;dc converter is proposed for electric vehicles with hybrid energy sources. The proposed converter is based on the traditional two-level quasi- Z-source bidirectional dc&#x2013;dc converter, changing the position of the main power switch. It has the advantages of a wide-voltage-gain range, a lower voltage stress across the power switches, and an absolute common ground. The operating principle, the voltage and current stresses on the power switches, the comparisons with the other converters, the small signal analysis, and the controller design are presented in this paper. Finally, a 300&#x00a0;W prototype with $U_{{rm{high}}}= {240  rm{V}}$  and $U_{{rm{low}}}= {40sim 120 rm{V}}$  is developed, and the experimental results validate the performance and the feasibility of the proposed converter.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Privacy-preserving data aggregation has been extensively studied in smart grid. However, almost all existing schemes aggregate the total electricity consumption data of the whole user set, which sometimes cannot meet the fine-grained demands from control center in smart grid. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving multisubset data aggregation scheme, named PPMA, in smart grid. PPMA can aggregate users&#x2019; electricity consumption data of different ranges, while guaranteeing the privacy of individual users. Detailed security analysis shows that PPMA can protect individual user&#x0027;s electricity consumption privacy against a strong adversary. In addition, extensive experiments results demonstrate that PPMA has less computation overhead and no more extra communication and storage costs.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Home energy management (HEM) systems enable residential consumers to participate in demand response programs (DRPs) more actively. However, HEM systems confront some practical difficulties due to the uncertainty related to renewable energies as well as the uncertainty of consumers&#x2019; behavior. Moreover, the consumers aim for the highest level of comfort and satisfaction in operating their electrical appliances. In addition, technical limits of the appliances must be considered. Furthermore, DR providers aim at keeping the participation of consumers in DRPs and minimize the &#x201c;response fatigue&#x201d; phenomenon in the long-term period. In this paper, a stochastic model of an HEM system is proposed by considering uncertainties of electric vehicles availability and small-scale renewable energy generation. The model optimizes the customer&#x0027;s cost in different DRPs, while guarantees the inhabitants&#x2019; satisfaction by introducing a response fatigue index. Different case studies indicate that the implementation of the proposed stochastic HEM system can considerably decrease both the customers&#x2019; cost and response fatigue.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Since operating conditions of power systems always change, the input and output signals of wide-area damping controller (WADC), which are selected at an operating point, may not be able to guarantee the damping effect at other operating points. This paper focuses on a new adaptive signal selection for WADC against several operating conditions, such as various load demands, control signal failure, line and generator outages, and effect of communication latency. The joint controllability and observability is used to determine the best input and output pairs of WADC at any operating points. Small-signal and transient stabilities study in the IEEE 50-machine system including renewable sources, i.e., wind and solar photovoltaic generators are conducted to evaluate the effect of the proposed method. Study result demonstrates that the WADC with the adaptive signal selection yields superior damping effect to the WADC with the fixed signal selection over wide range operations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>When single-loop inverter-side current control is used in the LCL-type inverters, there may be more than one stable region with regard to computation delay in control path. The system is stable if computation delay is small enough, but it, named as the first stable region, may be too narrow to finish the control codes in high-frequency system. On the other hand, the second stable region is highly sensitive to the grid impedance variation and is hardly applicable in weak grids. To deal with the situation, this paper investigates the influence of the capacitor voltage feedforward on the system stability considering flexible computation delay in feedforward path. It is found that the capacitor voltage feedforward is able to suppress the resonance of the LCL filter. However, a new resonance may arise if computation delay is not carefully handled. The influence of computation delay in both forward path and feedforward path on system stability is systematically analyzed. The analytical results show that after applying feedforward control with optimized delay, the system stability is greatly improved and is not sensitive to the grid impedance variation. The simulation and experiment results verify the analytical results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the widespread adoption of Internet of Things and cloud computing in different industry sectors, an increasing number of individuals or organizations are outsourcing their Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) data in the cloud server to achieve cost saving and collaboration (e.g., data sharing). However, in this environment, preserving the privacy of data remains a key challenge and inhibiting factor to an even wider adoption of IIoT in the cloud environment. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we design a new secure channel-free certificateless searchable public key encryption with multiple keywords scheme for IIoT deployment. We then demonstrate the security of the scheme in the random oracle model against two types of adversaries, where one adversary is given the power to choose a random public key instead of any user&#x0027;s public key and another adversary is allowed to learn the system master key. In the presence of these types of adversaries, we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme and demonstrate that it achieves (computational) efficiency with low communication cost.
