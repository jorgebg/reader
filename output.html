<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Research in adversarial machine learning has shown how the performance of
machine learning models can be seriously compromised by injecting even a small
fraction of poisoning points into the training data. While the effects on model
accuracy of such poisoning attacks have been widely studied, their potential
effects on other model performance metrics remain to be evaluated. In this
work, we introduce an optimization framework for poisoning attacks against
algorithmic fairness, and develop a gradient-based poisoning attack aimed at
introducing classification disparities among different groups in the data. We
empirically show that our attack is effective not only in the white-box
setting, in which the attacker has full access to the target model, but also in
a more challenging black-box scenario in which the attacks are optimized
against a substitute model and then transferred to the target model. We believe
that our findings pave the way towards the definition of an entirely novel set
of adversarial attacks targeting algorithmic fairness in different scenarios,
and that investigating such vulnerabilities will help design more robust
algorithms and countermeasures in the future.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We are living in an era when online communication over social network
services (SNSs) have become an indispensable part of people's everyday lives.
As a consequence, online social deception (OSD) in SNSs has emerged as a
serious threat in cyberspace, particularly for users vulnerable to such
cyberattacks. Cyber attackers have exploited the sophisticated features of SNSs
to carry out harmful OSD activities, such as financial fraud, privacy threat,
or sexual/labor exploitation. Therefore, it is critical to understand OSD and
develop effective countermeasures against OSD for building a trustworthy SNSs.
In this paper, we conducted an extensive survey, covering (i) the
multidisciplinary concepts of social deception; (ii) types of OSD attacks and
their unique characteristics compared to other social network attacks and
cybercrimes; (iii) comprehensive defense mechanisms embracing prevention,
detection, and response (or mitigation) against OSD attacks along with their
pros and cons; (iv) datasets/metrics used for validation and verification; and
(v) legal and ethical concerns related to OSD research. Based on this survey,
we provide insights into the effectiveness of countermeasures and the lessons
from existing literature. We conclude this survey paper with an in-depth
discussions on the limitations of the state-of-the-art and recommend future
research directions in this area.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic gave rise to management approaches using
mobile apps for contact tracing. The corresponding apps track individuals and
their interactions, to facilitate alerting users of potential infections well
before they become infectious themselves. Naive implementation obviously
jeopardizes the privacy of health conditions, location, activities, and social
interaction of its users. A number of protocol designs for colocation tracking
have already been developed, most of which claim to function in a privacy
preserving manner. However, despite claims such as "GDPR compliance",
"anonymity", "pseudonymity" or other forms of "privacy", the authors of these
designs usually neglect to precisely define what they (aim to) protect. We make
a first step towards formally defining the privacy notions of proximity tracing
services, especially with regards to the health, (co-)location, and social
interaction of their users. We also give a high-level intuition of which
protection the most prominent proposals can and cannot achieve. This initial
overview indicates that all proposals include some centralized services, and
none protects identity and (co-)locations of infected users perfectly from both
other users and the service provider.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we consider the problem of entanglement verification across
the quantum memories of any two nodes of a quantum network. Its solution can be
a means for detecting (albeit not preventing) the presence of intruders that
have taken full control of a node, either to make a denial-of-service attack or
to reprogram the node. Looking for strategies that only require local
operations and classical communication (LOCC), we propose two entanglement
verification protocols characterized by increasing robustness and efficiency.

<p>Long-lasting insecticide nets (LLINs) have had a large role in the reduction of malaria incidence in the endemic countries in sub-Saharan Africa. However, pyrethroid resistance is now widespread and threatens to not only render LLINs irrelevant, but also to reverse the gains made towards malaria elimination. The concern about resistance has prompted a suggestion that insecticides should be removed from LLINs to preserve them for other use in vector control measures.1

<p>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) refers to the integrative system consisting of interconnected computing and control devices interacting with the physical infrastructure via sensors and actuators. Recently, there is a swift growth of CPSs ranging from smart grids to smart buildings, robotics, and other industrial control systems. They have formed the keystone of the sustainable growth of the economy, manufacturing, and smart and connected communities. Due to extensive applications of CPSs, their resilience, reliability, and security are paramount. Many factors, however, pose significant threats to CPSs and lead to high economic losses and social impacts. Software defects also make CPSs vulnerable to security attacks and coordinated cyber and physical attacks. To address this issue, emerging technologies and methods for understanding and improving the resilience, reliability, and security of CPSs are needed. This Special Section aims to provide a platform to help define, understand, and quantify the resilience, reliability, and security of CPSs.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We present the physical-layer maximum a posteriori (MAP) test for detecting false data in multiple-source wireless relay networks. The MAP test, which minimizes the average probability of detection error, exploits the noisy (erroneous) information about the true packet that the destination receives (overhears) directly from the source nodes as a reference. We show that the average probability of detection error decreases exponentially as the number of source nodes increases, regardless of the reliability of the reference information. This indicates that the multiplicity of source nodes can be leveraged to construct a powerful integrity check mechanism for detecting false data at the destination. We also present a parallel MAP test that improves the detection accuracy when the number of source nodes is limited and overhearing channel disparities are high. Then, we present a packet recovery mechanism to recover false alarmed packets, i.e. unmodified packets that are mistakenly declared as modified, by the MAP test and thereby to improve the throughput.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, a decentralized energy management strategy (EMS), which is derived from the conventional droop control, is proposed for the auxiliary power unit composed of multiple fuel cells (FCs) and supercapacitors (SCs) of a more electric aircraft. By utilizing a virtual inductor droop scheme to the FC converter and a virtual resistor droop scheme to the SC converter, the proposed EMS is able to split the load power automatically into low and high frequency components and allocate them to the FC and SC units, respectively. In addition, by optimally designing the droop parameters, accurate power sharing among different source units is achieved. The proposed strategy is not only suitable for extending the service life of the system by adding State of Charge (SoC) protection mechanism in the energy management, but also can improve the system reliability as it is compatible for the disconnection of some source units when fault occurs. The operational principle of the proposed EMS and the detailed system design methodology are elaborated, followed by which hardware-in-the-loop simulation study based on Typhoon HIL 602 is done to verify its validity.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To effectively capture interactions of large-scale ac&#x2013;dc systems integrating line commutated converter (LCC) and modular multilevel converter (MMC) based multiterminal dc grids, a numerically accurate and efficient simulation method is desirable. To achieve this objective, a cosimulation method is proposed in this article, where the target system is decoupled into the shifted-frequency phasor (SFP) subsystem, the dynamic phasor (DP) subsystem, and electromagnetic transient (EMT) subsystem, respectively. The MMCs are included in the SFP subsystem and implemented on massively paralleled graphics processing units (GPUs). Thus, the simulation efficiency is greatly improved by adopting a much larger time step, the model order reduction technique, and GPU acceleration. The LCCs are represented by DPs and are included in the DP subsystem. The majority of ac grids are covered in the EMT subsystem. Further, the interactions between SFP and EMT subsystems are reflected by the proposed multidomain transmission line model, which can produce instantaneous and phasor values simultaneously. The interface model between DP and EMT subsystems is modeled as a special controlled voltage and current circuit. Finally, the overall cosimulation method is realized by the respective SFP/DP and EMT models, among which their interactions are reflected by the proposed interface models and the time sequences of simulations. The performance of the proposed method has been fully validated on a practical large-scale ac&#x2013;dc system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This article introduces a rotary semiactive variable stiffness (VS) device, including its system design and model validation. A variable damping (VD) device and springs can form mechanical networks with specific topologies, and the VD device can control the equivalent stiffness of the network by varying its damping. The proposed rotary electromagnetic VS device consists of an electromagnetic VD device and a torsion spring, which are in series, while a planetary gear reducer is used to amplify the torque output of the VS device. The models of the electromagnetic VD and VS devices are both built and validated with tests. Then, a seat suspension applies the VS device by installing the device in the center of its scissors structure. Bump and random vibration experiments are implemented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed VS system for seat suspension vibration control. The new system has merits in controllability and energy efficiency. It is easier to design the controller than the conventional one with magnetorheological damper due to the linear damping of the electromagnetic VD device. Besides, the system energy consumption is low and has energy harvesting capability. The proposed semiactive electromagnetic VS device also has potential in other practical applicationss.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The quality assessment of the sound power generated by refrigeration compressors is an important and costly process for manufacturers, mainly due to the need for acoustic rooms. Hence, very few samples per lot are tested. In this article, an alternative method based on soft sensing is proposed to estimate the sound power of refrigeration compressors. The method uses vibration measurements from the compressor surface as the input and the sound power generated as the output of machine learning (ML) models to create data-driven soft sensors. This method is less restrictive than the traditional ones and allows a test to be done close to the manufacturing line, in a much faster and cheaper way. In order to create the dataset to train the ML models, sound power and vibration levels of compressors were measured simultaneously in a reverberation room. The results from the data-driven soft sensors were compared with the ones obtained using a simple analytic model defined in an ISO technical note and showed that, even with as little as one vibration measurement point, the proposed method presented better results than the ISO analytic model with nine measurement points.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The problem of inefficient and unevenly distributed spectrum usage in industrial wireless networks has led to the emergence of the concept of industrial cognitive radio (CR) networks, which have particularly important applications in automotive industry. Industrial CR networks are planned to function in a wide spectrum range; therefore, they have high energy consumption because of frequency switching while other wireless technologies do not have this problem. A distinctive feature of this switching cost is that it depends on the wideness between the two frequency bands. In this article, we formulate the joint frequency assignment and scheduling problem for multihop industrial CR networks with a single transceiver by considering varying amounts of energy consumption that occurs while CR devices switch to different frequency bands. Our optimization problem, which we formulate as an integer linear program, minimizes the energy cost related to frequency switching while making frequency and time slot allocation to the cognitive devices. We prove that even on star graphs, our formulated problem is inapproximable within any polynomial-time computable function $f(n)$ in addition to being $textsc {NP}text {-Hard}$ in the strong sense. Therefore, we propose a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm to solve the energy consumption problem due to channel switching. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of our heuristic algorithm is very close to the results obtained from the integer linear programming implementation by CPLEX optimization software. We also compare our proposed method with the corresponding constant energy consumption for frequency switching case and two state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrate that taking into account the different energy consumption while switching to different frequency bands -
s vital for joint frequency assignment and scheduling in multihop industrial CR networks with a single transceiver.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Poor signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and low spatial resolutions have impeded low-cost pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensors from many intelligent applications for thermal target detection/recognition. This article presents a cognitive signal conditioning and modulation learning framework for PIR sensing with the following two innovations to solve these problems: 1) a reconfigurable signal conditioning circuit design to achieve high SNRs and 2) an optimal sensor mask design to achieve high recognition performance. By using a programmable system on chip, the PIR signal amplifier gain and filter bandwidth can be adjusted automatically according to working conditions. Based on the modeling between PIR physics and thermal images, sensor masks can be optimized through training convolution neural networks with large thermal image datasets for feature extraction of specific thermal targets. The experimental results verify the improved performance of PIR sensors in various working conditions and applications by using the developed reconfigurable circuit and application-specific masks.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, we present a metaheuristic-based control framework, called beetle antennae olfactory recurrent neural network, for simultaneous tracking control and obstacle avoidance of a redundant manipulator. The ability to avoid obstacles while tracking a predefined reference path is critical for any industrial manipulator. The formulated control framework unifies the tracking control and obstacle avoidance into a single constrained optimization problem by introducing a penalty term into the objective function, which actively rewards the optimizer for avoiding the obstacles. One of the significant features of the proposed framework is the way that the penalty term is formulated following a straightforward principle: maximize the minimum distance between a manipulator and an obstacle. The distance calculations are based on Gilbert&#x2013;Johnson&#x2013;Keerthi algorithm, which calculates the distance between a manipulator and an obstacle by directly using their three-dimensional geometries, which also implies that our algorithm works for a manipulator and an arbitrarily shaped obstacle. Theoretical treatment proves the stability and convergence, and simulations results using an LBR IIWA seven-DOF manipulator are presented to analyze the performance of the proposed framework.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, we consider the security problem for the consensus-based distributed state estimation. To resist the malicious attacker who can falsify the data transmitted through the wireless channel, each node equips with an attack defender, which is based on the measurement of its built-in sensor. Under the stealthy attack, which can deceive the defender, we investigate the resilience and convergence of the distributed estimation in two different attack scenarios. For the attack with enough communication resources, we provide a sufficient condition of the optimal attack to quantify the maximum estimation performance degradation. We also analyze the resilience of the worst case distributed estimation caused by the attacker. For the attack with limited resources, the optimal Kalman gain for each node is derived to maximize its estimation performance under the attack. We also give a sufficient condition to guarantee the convergence of the distributed estimation in this case. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effect of the defender on guaranteeing the resilience of sensor networks against attacks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep learning methods for image quality assessment (IQA) are limited due to the small size of existing datasets. Extensive datasets require substantial resources both for generating publishable content and annotating it accurately. We present a systematic and scalable approach to creating KonIQ-10k, the largest IQA dataset to date, consisting of 10,073 quality scored images. It is the first in-the-wild database aiming for ecological validity, concerning the authenticity of distortions, the diversity of content, and quality-related indicators. Through the use of crowdsourcing, we obtained 1.2 million reliable quality ratings from 1,459 crowd workers, paving the way for more general IQA models. We propose a novel, deep learning model (KonCept512), to show an excellent generalization beyond the test set (0.921 SROCC), to the current state-of-the-art database LIVE-in-the-Wild (0.825 SROCC). The model derives its core performance from the InceptionResNet architecture, being trained at a higher resolution than previous models (512 &#x00d7; 384 ). Correlation analysis shows that KonCept512 performs similar to having 9 subjective scores for each test image.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>People constantly share their photographs with others through various social media sites. With the aid of the privacy settings provided by social media sites, image owners can designate scope of sharing, e.g., close friends and acquaintances. However, even if the owner of a photograph carefully sets the privacy setting to exclude a given individual who is not supposed to see the photograph, the photograph may still eventually reach a wider audience, including those clearly undesired through unanticipated channels of disclosure, causing a privacy breach. Moreover, it is often the case that a given image involves multiple stakeholders who are also depicted in the photograph. Due to various personalities, it is even more challenging to reach agreement on the privacy settings for these multi-owner photographs. In this paper, we propose a privacy risk reminder system, called REMIND, which estimates the probability that a shared photograph may be seen by unwanted people-through the social graph-who are not included in the original sharing list. We tackle this problem from a novel angle by digging into the big data regarding image sharing history. Specifically, the social media providers possess a huge amount of image sharing information (e.g., what photographs are shared with whom) of their users. By analyzing and modeling such rich information, we build a sophisticated probability model that efficiently aggregates the image disclosure probabilities along different possible image propagation chains and loops. If the computed disclosure probability indicates high risks of privacy breach, a reminder is issued to the image owner to help revise the privacy settings (or, at least, inform the user about this accidental disclosure risk). The proposed REMIND system also has a nice feature of policy harmonization that helps resolve privacy differences in multi-owner photographs. We have carried out a user study to validate the rationale of our proposed solutions and also conducte-
 experimental studies to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed REMIND system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The side-channel leakage is a consequence of program execution in a computer processor, and understanding relationship between code execution and information leakage is a necessary step in estimating information leakage and its capacity limits. This paper proposes a methodology to relate program execution to electromagnetic side-channel emanations and estimates side-channel information capacity created by execution of series of instructions (e.g., a function, a procedure, or a program) in a processor. To model dependence among program instructions in a code, we propose to use Markov source model, which includes the dependencies among sequence of instructions as well as dependencies among instructions as they pass through a pipeline of the processor. The emitted electromagnetic (EM) signals during instruction executions are natural choice for the inputs into the model. To obtain the channel inputs for the proposed model, we derive a mathematical relationship between the emanated instruction signal power (ESP) and total emanated signal power while running a program. Then, we derive the leakage capacity of EM side channels created by execution of series of instructions in a processor. Finally, we provide experimental results to demonstrate that leakages could be severe and that a dedicated attacker could obtain important information.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

<p>Online romance scams are a prevalent form of mass-marketing fraud in the West, and yet few studies have presented data-driven responses to this problem. In this type of scam, fraudsters craft fake profiles and manually interact with their victims. Because of the characteristics of this type of fraud and how dating sites operate, traditional detection methods (e.g., those used in spam filtering) are ineffective. In this paper, we investigate the archetype of online dating profiles used in this form of fraud, including their use of demographics, profile descriptions, and images, shedding light on both the strategies deployed by scammers to appeal to victims and the traits of victims themselves. Furthermore, in response to the severe financial and psychological harm caused by dating fraud, we develop a system to detect romance scammers on online dating platforms. This paper presents the first fully described system for automatically detecting this fraud. Our aim is to provide an early detection system to stop romance scammers as they create fraudulent profiles or before they engage with potential victims. Previous research has indicated that the victims of romance scams score highly on scales for idealized romantic beliefs. We combine a range of structured, unstructured, and deep-learned features that capture these beliefs in order to build a detection system. Our ensemble machine-learning approach is robust to the omission of profile details and performs at high accuracy (97%) in a hold-out validation set. The system enables development of automated tools for dating site providers and individual users.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Benefiting from the quick development of deep convolutional neural networks, especially fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), remarkable progresses have been achieved on salient object detection recently. Nevertheless, these FCNs based methods are still challenging to generate high resolution saliency maps, and also not applicable for subsequent applications due to their heavy model weights. In this paper, we propose a compact and efficient deep network with high accuracy for salient object detection. Firstly, we propose two strategies for initial prediction, one is a new designed multi-scale context module, the other is incorporating hand-crafted saliency priors. Secondly, we employ residual learning to refine it progressively by only learning the residual in each side-output, which can be achieved with few convolutional parameters, therefore leads to high compactness and high efficiency. Finally, we further design a novel top-down reverse attention block to guide the above side-output residual learning. Specifically, the current predicted salient regions are used to erase its side-output feature, thus the missing object parts and details can be efficiently learned from these unerased regions, which results in more complete detection and high accuracy. Extensive experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed network performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches, and shows advantages in simplicity, compactness and efficiency.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Seismic image interpolation is a currently popular research subject in modern reflection seismology. The interpolation problem is generally treated as a process of inversion. Under the compressed sensing framework, various sparse transformations and low-rank constraints based methods have great performances in recovering irregularly missing traces. However, in the case of regularly missing traces, their applications are limited because of the strong spatial aliasing energies. In addition, the erratic noise always poses a serious impact on the interpolation results obtained by the sparse transformations and low-rank constraints-based methods,. This is because the erratic noise is far from satisfying the statistical assumption behind these methods. In this study, we propose a mathematical morphology-based interpolation technique, which constrains the morphological scale of the model in the inversion process. The inversion problem is solved by the shaping regularization approach. The mathematical morphological constraint (MMC)-based interpolation technique has a satisfactory robustness to the spatial aliasing and erratic energies. We provide a detailed algorithmic framework and discuss the extension from 2D to higher dimensional version and the back operator in the shaping inversion. A group of numerical examples demonstrates the successful performance of the proposed technique.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The human visual system tends to consider saliency of an object as a whole. Some object-level saliency detection methods have been proposed by leveraging object proposals in bounding boxes, and regarding the entire bounding box as one candidate salient region. However, the bounding boxes can not provide exact object position and a lot of pixels in bounding boxes belong to the background. Consequently, background pixels in bounding box also show high saliency. Besides, acquiring object proposals needs high time cost. In order to compute object-level saliency, we consider region growing from some seed superpixels, to find one surrounding region which probably represents the whole object. The desired surrounding region has similar appearance inside and obvious difference with the outside, which is proposed as maximally stable region (MSR) in this paper. In addition, one effective seed superpixel selection strategy is presented to improve speed. MSR based saliency detection is more robust than pixel or superpixel level methods and object proposal based methods. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods at 50 FPS. Compared with deep learning based methods, we show worse performance, but with about 1200-1600 times faster, which means better trade-off between performance and speed.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we develop a concise but efficient network architecture called linear compressing based skip-connecting network (LCSCNet) for image super-resolution. Compared with two representative network architectures with skip connections, ResNet and DenseNet, a linear compressing layer is designed in LCSCNet for skip connection, which connects former feature maps and distinguishes them from newly-explored feature maps. In this way, the proposed LCSCNet enjoys the merits of the distinguish feature treatment of DenseNet and the parameter-economic form of ResNet. Moreover, to better exploit hierarchical information from both low and high levels of various receptive fields in deep models, inspired by gate units in LSTM, we also propose an adaptive element-wise fusion strategy with multi-supervised training. Experimental results in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms validate the effectiveness of LCSCNet.
