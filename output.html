<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>New strains of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have exhibited potential to disconnect communication networks, even cutting off entire countries from the Internet. The &#x201c;crossfire&#x201d; is a new, indirect DDoS link-flooding attack, which masks itself as natural congestion, making it very hard to counter. Several studies have proposed online attack detection schemes, whose efficiency has been shown to vary in different network topologies. However, the topology/detection relation has been studied qualitatively, without formal proof or quantification metric. This paper is motivated by the fact that network topology changes are generally expensive and slow. Therefore, network designers should be provided with means of evaluating the effects of topology modifications to the attack detection efficiency. This paper fills this gap by contributing a formal proof for the topology-detection efficiency relation, as well as a novel off-line metric that quantifies it. Full attack prototypes are implemented and evaluated in real-Internet topologies, validating the analytical findings. It is shown that the novel metric expresses the topology-detection relation efficiently, while existing and widely used metrics do not constitute good choices for this task.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Vulnerability of face recognition systems to presentation attacks has attracted increasing attention from the biometrics and forensics communities. Moreover, the recent availability of light field cameras is opening new possibilities for designing improved face presentation attack detection solutions. In this context, this paper provides the first review and benchmarking study in the literature on light field-based face presentation attack detection solutions. State-of-the-art solutions are assessed in terms of accuracy, generalization and complexity, using a common, representative evaluation framework. This paper also proposes a novel face presentation attack detection solution, based on a histogram of oriented gradients descriptor, which exploits the disparity information available in light field imaging. The evaluation of the proposed face presentation attack detection solution for different presentation attack types shows a very effective and stable performance, notably performing better than the state-of-the-art alternatives.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The classical Bloom filter data structure is a crucial component of hundreds of cryptographic protocols. It has been used in privacy preservation and secure computation settings, often in conjunction with the (somewhat) homomorphic properties of ciphers such as Paillier&#x2019;s. In 2014, a new data structure extending and surpassing the capabilities of the classical Bloom filter has been proposed. The new primitive, called spatial Bloom filter (SBF) retains the hash-based membership-query design of the Bloom filter, but applies it to elements from multiple sets. Since its introduction, the SBF has been used in the design of cryptographic protocols for a number of domains, including location privacy and network security. However, due to the complex nature of this probabilistic data structure, its properties had not been fully understood. In this paper, we address this gap in knowledge and we fully explore the probabilistic properties of the SBF. In doing so, we define a number of metrics (such as emersion and safeness) useful in determining the parameters needed to achieve certain characteristics in a filter, including the false positive probability and inter-set error rate. This will in turn enable the design of more efficient cryptographic protocols based on the SBF, opening the way to their practical application in a number of security and privacy settings.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The principle of compressed sensing (CS) can be applied in a cryptosystem by providing the notion of security. The Gaussian one-time sensing (G-OTS) CS-based cryptosystem employing a random Gaussian matrix and renewing the elements at each encryption is known to be perfectly secure, as long as each plaintext has constant energy. A random Bernoulli matrix can replace the Gaussian one for encrypting each plaintext efficiently in the Bernoulli one-time sensing (B-OTS) cryptosystem. In this paper, we analyze the security of G-OTS and B-OTS cryptosystems, respectively, where each cryptosystem may have unequal plaintext energy. By means of probability metrics, we study the indistinguishability of each CS-based cryptosystem, which formalizes the notion of computational security. Moreover, we investigate how much the indistinguishability is sensitive to energy variation of plaintexts in each cryptosystem. For the B-OTS cryptosystem, we analyze the indistinguishability and the energy sensitivity in a non-asymptotic manner for a finite plaintext length. In conclusion, this paper confirms that G-OTS and B-OTS cryptosystems can be strictly and asymptotically indistinguishable, respectively, as long as each plaintext has constant energy, but the indistinguishability is highly sensitive to energy variation of plaintexts.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we consider the design of a new secure transmission scheme for a four-node relay-eavesdropper channel, where user cooperation is used to facilitate secure communications. The key idea of the proposed achievable scheme is to apply the compression relaying concept of noisy network coding (NNC) to the secrecy communication scenario. But different from the original non-secrecy NNC, the compression rate at the relay is adaptively chosen according to the eavesdropping channel. Particularly, helping interference information is injected into the compression codebook at the relay by simply enlarging the compression rate, which is to effectively suppress the eavesdropping channel. Closed-form expressions of the secrecy rates achieved by the proposed NNC-based secure scheme are characterized for both the discrete memoryless and Gaussian relay-eavesdropper channels, where the optimal compression rate and the optimal transmit power at the relay are also determined. The proposed secure scheme can be viewed as a general framework, which naturally combines the NNC compression relaying scheme with the interference-assisted scheme. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed secure scheme offers constant performance gains over typical existing cooperative secure schemes.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a single-switch single power-conversion (S$^text{3}$ PC) power factor correction (PFC) converter. Using the series-resonant circuit, the S $^text{3}$PC converter provides bidirectional core excitation for the transformer and obtains higher power capability compared with the conventional single-switch PFC converters. Also, the series-resonant circuit provides zero-current switching turn-off for the output diodes, so that the reverse-recovery loss is alleviated. The regenerative snubber not only avoids the voltage spike of the switch but also recycles the absorbed energy. Because these features are obtained with only a single switch and through single power-conversion, the S$^text{3}$PC converter has high efficiency and simple structure. The control algorithm derived from feedback linearization enables the S$^text{3}$PC converter to obtain good controllability. Also, by using this control algorithm, the proposed converter performs both PFC control and output power control through single power-conversion. With these advantages, the S $^text{3}$PC converter provides maximum efficiency of 96.4&#x0025; and high power factor in excess of 0.994. The proposed converter is theoretically analyzed in detail, and experimental results are applied to a 1-kW prototype to show its validity.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, the design and development of a novel interleaved tri-state boost converter (ITBC), which produces lower ripple and exhibits better dynamic response, is discussed. Boost converters are frequently connected in parallel and operate in an interleaving mode for the reduction of ripple content in source current and in output voltage. In this way, interleaved boost converter (IBC) is conceived, which improves the power handling capabilities and increases the overall system rating. It also has the advantage of reduction of the ripple content in source current and output voltage, but when control-to-output transfer function of IBC is derived under continuous conduction mode of operation, then a right-half-plane (RHP) zero appears in the transfer function. Due to the presence of RHP zero, IBC has nonminimum phase problem, which deteriorates the dynamic performance. The tri-state boost converter (TBC) is the best choice for RHP zero elimination, but due to the extra freewheeling mode, ripple content will also be increased. The proposed converter is a parallel combination of two TBC and operates in an interleaving mode. Therefore, the proposed converter has both of the advantages of TBC and IBC. The performance analyses of ITBC, TBC, and IBC have been studied based on simulation and experimental results. From the comparative analysis, it is observed that ITBC is performed better than other two converters. The ripple comparisons between three converters have also been done. It is found that the ripple content in ITBC is slightly greater than IBC but is less than TBC.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A sliding-mode grid voltage observer (SMGVO) is proposed and experimentally verified in this paper for voltage-sensorless operation under an unbalanced network. The fundamental positive sequence component (FPSC) and fundamental negative sequence component (FNSC) are inherently separated in the observer without employing any additional filters. Due to embedded filtering effect, high frequency chattering and harmonic ripples can be well suppressed. Additionally, dc components can be completely rejected. As a result, dc offset would not cause fundamental frequency oscillations in magnitude and frequency of the estimated FPSC and FNSC. Owing to the predictive ability of SMGVO, one-step delay can be directly compensated using state variables in the observer. By combining estimation and prediction into one stage, the designed SMGVO turns out to be a compact solution for finite-control-set model predictive power control without voltage sensors. Theoretical proof is derived to verify that FPSC and FNSC can be accurately estimated and separated. Experimental results obtained from a two-level PWM rectifier confirm the effectiveness of the whole control system.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a novel analytical-based kinematic and dynamic modeling and control approach is developed for reference speed tracking of a multijoint robotic fish. The kinematic model is improved by the introduction of input signal for controlling body undulation amplitude without distorting the model structure. Next, the dynamic model is developed in the discrete-time domain primarily because fish swimming pattern generates oscillating continuous thrust where the effect of thrust over one cycle of undulation can be calculated through averaging. Hence, the dynamics can be discretized according to the undulation rate. The novelty in developing the discrete-time dynamical model is three fold. First, the thrust gradient is derived with assistance of Lighthill&#x0027;s large amplitude elongated body theory. More importantly, affine-in-control dynamical model form, essential for designing a real-time model-based control algorithm, is derived by inclusion of the updated kinematic model. Second, the thrust delay is studied via pulse input response of the motion system, and incorporated in the dynamical model. Third, drag force coefficient calculation is also proposed by comparing the thrust model and empirically recorded steady-state speeds of the robotic fish. Finally, discrete-time model-based sliding-mode control (SMC) is designed for speed tracking. Experimental results verify that SMC based on the proposed dynamical model, can significantly improve speed tracking performance of a multilink robotic fish.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The main torsional mode of electrostatically actuated micromirrors is known to be dominated by parametric resonance when the actuation is performed via in-plane comb fingers. Here, we show that, for specific geometrical features of the mirror, parametric resonance simultaneously activates a spurious yaw mode. Due to the large torsional rotations, the two modes are nonlinearly coupled, inducing mutual stiffness variations and an unexpected temperature dependence of the main mode. After presenting an experimental evidence of the coupling, we develop and discuss a numerical model capable of capturing the key phenomena and of providing guidelines for a robust design.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Cooperative dual-crane lifting is an important but challenging process involved in heavy and critical lifting tasks. This paper considers the path planning for the cooperative dual-crane lifting. It aims to automatically generate optimal dual-crane lifting paths under multiple constraints, i.e., collision avoidance, coordination between the two cranes, and balance of the lifting target. Previous works often used oversimplified models for the dual-crane lifting system, the lifting environment, and the motion of the lifting target. They were thus limited to simple lifting cases and might even lead to unsafe paths in some cases. We develop a novel path planner for dual-crane lifting that can quickly produce optimized paths in complex 3-D environments. The planner has fully considered the kinematic structure of the lifting system. Therefore, it is able to robustly handle the nonlinear movement of the suspended target during lifting. The effectiveness and efficiency of the planner are enabled by three novel aspects: 1) a comprehensive and computationally efficient mathematical modeling of the lifting system; 2) a new multiobjective parallel genetic algorithm designed to solve the path planning problem; and 3) a new efficient approach to perform continuous collision detection for the dual-crane lifting target. The planner has been tested in complex industrial environments. The results show that the planner can generate dual-crane lifting paths that are easy for conductions and optimized in terms of costs for complex environments. Comparisons with two previous methods demonstrate the advantages of the planner, including safer paths, higher success rates, and the ability to handle general lifting cases.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a precise and robust localization framework for autonomous vehicles. In contrast to simultaneous localization and mapping, localization and mapping in our method are separate (i.e., first mapping and then localization within this map). The map used in this paper is a 3-D occupancy map that is generated from a stitched point cloud. For localization, a hybrid filtering framework is proposed to match the live data with the prior map. In the upper layer, odometer data, IMU data, and the map matching result are fused by a cubature Kalman filter, which will limit the predictive pose within a reasonable bound. In the lower layer, the map matching problem is converted into a point set registration problem that is solved using a particle filter, which will make the matching result robust to local minima. This hybrid scheme makes localization more robust to convergence to a local minimum, which is often encountered in the localization task for autonomous vehicles. This method can also guarantee decimeter-level precision in industrial environments. Experiments demonstrate the validity of this method and also show that it outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents a differential evolution algorithm with a new encoding mechanism for efficiently solving the optimal layout of the wind farm, with the aim of maximizing the power output. In the modeling of the wind farm, the wake effects among different wind turbines are considered and the Weibull distribution is employed to estimate the wind speed distribution. In the process of evolution, a new encoding mechanism for the locations of wind turbines is designed based on the characteristics of the wind farm layout. This encoding mechanism is the first attempt to treat the location of each wind turbine as an individual. As a result, the whole population represents a layout. Compared with the traditional encoding, the advantages of this encoding mechanism are twofold: 1) the dimension of the search space is reduced to two, and 2) a crucial parameter (i.e., the population size) is eliminated. In addition, differential evolution serves as the search engine and the caching technique is adopted to enhance the computational efficiency. The comparative analysis between the proposed method and seven other state-of-the-art methods is conducted based on two wind scenarios. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is able to obtain the best overall performance, in terms of the power output and execution time.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper addresses the time-delay effects of the wide-area monitoring and control systems (WAMCS) in smart power grids which may critically impact system stability. The main purpose is to conduct a detailed delay analysis of the WAMCS in case of grid contingences. This analysis is performed via an advanced WAMCS testbed where a flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) device is utilized and controlled via a wide-area controller (WAC). Phasor measurements units (PMUs) are adopted to collect the real-time measurements for the WAC. The testbed results from an interface of four main segments known as the WAC; the actual FACTS device, the local area controller, and the power grid system along with the PMUs are simulated via a real-time digital simulator. To mimic the real case scenario, both hardware-in-the-loop and software-in-the-loop schemes are adopted in the experimental testbed, considering time-delay effects. The results obtained clarify the effect of delay in WAMCS in case of smart grid contingences.

In this Series paper, we explore the aetiology of OHCA. Coronary artery disease remains the predominant cause, but there is a diverse range of other potential cardiac and non-cardiac causes to be aware of.
