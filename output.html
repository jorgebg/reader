<p>Understanding the evolution of microorganisms under antibiotic treatments is a burning issue.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents linear-fractional-trans-formation (LFT)-structured uncertainty state-space modeling for robust control of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ultra-precision wafer stage with flexible structures to meet the challenges of vibration-dependent model uncertainties. Specifically, based on the modal MIMO state-space model, a parametric uncertainty model related with flexible modes is presented, and the uncertainty parameters are structured to a diagonal matrix with the LFT method. Meanwhile, a multiplicative uncertainty model is employed to express the uncertainty in high frequency with respect to ignored high-order modes. Thus, the final uncertainty model is structured with uncertainty parameters and high-frequency uncertainty. Based on the proposed uncertainty model, a comprehensive robust control scheme is proposed. Specifically, the weighting function matrixes are designed by the loop-shaping approach, and a $mu$ analysis is employed to achieve a nonconservative solution with respect to the structured uncertainty. A standard stability criterion of a $bf{M} boldsymbol{Delta}$ structure system is then utilized to determine the system stability by the largest structure singular value. Comparative experiments on a developed ultra-precision wafer stage are finally conducted, and the results validate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements on control performance, robustness, and robust stability in all exposure fields.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Energy imbalance market (EIM) provides an opportunity that allows larger shares of variable renewable energy sources in the grid. Under highly volatile weather conditions, an accurate forecasting of photovoltaic (PV) power is necessary for grid stability and market operation. Most of existing forecasting methods strongly rely on the accuracy of measurements, and the adaptability of these methods to complex weather conditions is rarely discussed. In this paper, a weather classification multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) forecasting model is introduced for complex weather conditions in all seasons. It can be updated incrementally and its high computational efficiency satisfies EIM operations. A data set that consists of the historical power and meteorological parameters produced by a small-scale PV platform is classified and used to train MARS models with forecast horizons ranging from 15 min to 24 h in different seasons. The tests and analyses results indicate higher accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency of the novel model.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a two-degrees-of-freedom control algorithm based on uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE), aimed to minimize the total harmonic distortion of inverter output voltage is proposed, possessing enhanced robustness to fundamental frequency variations. A multiple-time-delay action is combined with a commonly utilized low-pass UDE filter to increase the range of output impedance magnitude minimization around odd multiples of fundamental frequency for enhanced rejection of typical single-phase nonlinear loads harmonics. Marginal robustness improvement achieved by increasing the number of time delays is quantified analytically and revealed to be independent of delay order. The performance of the proposed control approach and its superiority over two recently proposed methods is validated successfully by experimental results.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper introduces a novel self-tuned perturb and observe (SPO) algorithm for quick maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and a novel maximize-M Kalman filter (MMKF)-based control technique for optimal operation of grid-integrated solar photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion system, where linear&#x002f;nonlinear loads are attached at point of common coupling (PCC). The proposed SPO is the improved form of perturb and observe (P&amp;O) algorithm, where inherent problems of traditional P&amp;O such as steady-state oscillation, slow dynamic responses, and fixed step size issues, are successfully mitigated. Therefore, SPO tracks maximum power peak (MPP) very rapidly, and it very accurately extracts maximum power from the PV array. The extracted power is used to meet the active power requirement of loads, and after meeting the load demand, the excess power is supplied to the grid. During power feeding, the power quality and power management are maintained by the MMKF-based control technique. In control strategy, the MMKF is used for fundamental harmonic component extraction from the grid voltage and load current, even when the grid voltage is characterized by adverse situations, such as sag, swell, harmonic distortion, dc offset, etc. Here, the SPO MPPT algorithm and MMKF-based control techniques are tested on a developed prototype. The efficient and reliable performances of SPO MPPT algorithm and MMKF-based control algorithm, in dynamic as well as in steady-state condition, are demonstrated under insolation variation conditions, nonlinear loading, as well as in different grid disturbances such as overvoltage, undervoltage, phase imbalance, harmonics distortion in the grid voltage, etc.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a coordinated droop control method through virtual voltage axis is proposed for voltage restoration and energy management of dc microgrids (MGs). Droop control is a control method that operates a dc MG using only local information. However, there are several drawbacks in that output voltage deviations occur, and the utilization priorities of various sources are not considered. To solve these problems, the voltage compensation term is defined as the virtual axis voltage value. It can minimize the voltage deviation of the dc MG and enable energy management by determining the operation band. However, the value of the virtual voltage axis is affected by communication delays. Therefore, its influence on the values of the virtual voltage axis was analyzed. The reference voltage and the droop gain of the droop control were designed, and the validity of the proposed method was verified using a lab-scale dc MG.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we present a multichannel cross-modal fusion algorithm to combine two complementary modalities in electron tomography: X-ray spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The former reveals compositions with high elemental specificity but low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while the latter characterizes the structure with high SNR but little chemical information. We use a multivariate regression to build a cross-modal fusion framework for these two modalities to simultaneously achieve high elemental specificity and high SNR for a target element chosen from the sample under study. Specifically, we first compute three-dimensional tomograms from tilt-series datasets of X-ray and STEM using different reconstruction algorithms. Then, we generate many feature images from each tomogram. Finally, we adopt partial least squares regression to assess the connection between these feature images and the reconstruction of the target element. Based on the simulated and experimental datasets of semiconductor devices, we demonstrate that our algorithm can not only produce continuous edges, homogeneous foreground, and clean background in its element-specific reconstructions but also can more accurately preserve fine structures than state-of-the-art tomography techniques. Moreover, we show that it can deliver results with high fidelity even for X-ray datasets with limited tilts or low counts. This property is highly desired in the semiconductor industry where acquisition time and sample damage are essential.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents an intelligent system named Magic-wall, which enables visualization of the effect of room decoration automatically. Concretely, given an image of the indoor scene and a preferred color, the Magic-wall can automatically locate the wall regions in the image and smoothly replace the existing wall with the required one. The key idea of the proposed Magic-wall is to leverage visual semantics to guide the entire process of color substitution, including wall segmentation and replacement. To strengthen the reality of visualization, we make the following contributions. First, we propose an edge-aware fully convolutional neural network (Edge-aware-FCN) for indoor semantic scene parsing, in which a novel edge-prior branch is introduced to identify the boundary of different semantic regions better. To further polish the details between the wall and other semantic regions, we leverage the output of Edge-aware-FCN as the prior knowledge, concatenating with the image to form a new input for the Enhanced-Net. In such a case, the Enhanced-Net is able to capture more semantic-aware information from the input and polish some ambiguous regions. Finally, to naturally replace the color of the original walls, a simple yet effective color space conversion method is proposed for replacement with brightness reserved. We build a new indoor scene dataset upon ADE20K for training and testing, which includes six semantic labels. Extensive experimental evaluations and visualizations well demonstrate that the proposed Magic-wall is effective and can automatically generate a set of visually pleasing results.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Filtering images of more than one channel are challenging in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. By grouping similar patches to utilize the self-similarity and sparse linear approximation of natural images, recent nonlocal and transform-domain methods have been widely used in color and multispectral image (MSI) denoising. Many related methods focus on the modeling of group level correlation to enhance sparsity, which often resorts to a recursive strategy with a large number of similar patches. The importance of the patch level representation is understated. In this paper, we mainly investigate the influence and potential of representation at patch level by considering a general formulation with a block diagonal matrix. We further show that by training a proper global patch basis, along with a local principal component analysis transform in the grouping dimension, a simple transform-threshold-inverse method could produce very competitive results. Fast implementation is also developed to reduce the computational complexity. The extensive experiments on both the simulated and real datasets demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness, and efficiency.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose and develop a novel nonlocal variational technique based on structural similarity (SS) information for image restoration problems. In the literature, patches extracted from images are compared according to their pixel values, and then nonlocal filtering can be employed for image restoration. The disadvantage of this approach is that intensity-based patch distance may not be effective in image restoration, especially for images containing texture or structural information. The main aim of this paper is to propose using SS between image patches to develop nonlocal regularization models. In particular, two types of nonlocal regularizing functions are studied: an SS-based nonlocal quadratic function (SS-NLH1) and an SS-based nonlocal total variation function (SS-NLTV) for regularization of image restoration problems. Moreover, we employ iterative algorithms to solve these SS-NLH1 and SS-NLTV variational models numerically and discuss the convergence of these algorithms. The experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Capturing images at high ISO modes will introduce much realistic noise, which is difficult to be removed by traditional denoising methods. In this paper, we propose a novel denoising method for high ISO JPEG images via deep fusion of collaborative and convolutional filtering. Collaborative filtering explores the non-local similarity of natural images, while convolutional filtering takes advantage of the large capacity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to infer noise from noisy images. We observe that the noise variance map of a high ISO JPEG image is spatial-dependent and has a Bayer-like pattern. Therefore, we introduce the Bayer pattern prior in our noise estimation and collaborative filtering stages. Since collaborative filtering is good at recovering repeatable structures and convolutional filtering is good at recovering irregular patterns and removing noise in flat regions, we propose to fuse the strengths of the two methods via deep CNN. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art realistic noise removal methods for a wide variety of testing images in both subjective and objective measurements. In addition, we construct a dataset with noisy and clean image pairs for high ISO JPEG images to facilitate research on this topic.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is revolutionizing the retail industry for manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers to improve operational efficiency and consumer experience. In IIoT-enabled retail marketing, reputation systems play a critical role to boost mutual trust among industrial entities and build consumer confidence. In this paper, we focus on reputation management in the consumer-retailer channel, where retailers can accumulate reputations from consumer feedbacks. To encourage consumers to post feedbacks without worrying about being tracked or retaliated, we propose an anonymous reputation system that preserves consumer identities and individual review confidentialities. To increase system transparency and reliability, we further exploit the tamper-proof nature and the distributed consensus mechanism of the blockchain technology. With system designs based on various cryptographic primitives and a Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol, our blockchain-based reputation system is more efficient to offer high levels of privacy guarantees compared with existing ones. Finally, we explore the implementation challenges of the blockchain-based architecture and present a proof-of-concept prototype system by Parity Ethereum. We measure the on/off-chain performance with the scalability discussion to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system.

<p>The previous blockchain data transmission techniques in industrial Internet of Things (IoT) have low security, high management cost of the trading center, and big difficulty in supervision. To address these issues, this paper proposes a secure FaBric blockchain-based data transmission technique for industrial IoT. This technique uses the blockchain-based dynamic secret sharing mechanism. A reliable trading center is realized using the power blockchain sharing model, which can also share power trading books. The power data consensus mechanism and dynamic linked storage are designed to realize the secure matching of the power data transmission. Experiments show that the optimized FaBric power data storage and transmission has high security and reliability. The proposed technique can improve the transmission rate and packet receiving rate by 12% and 13%, respectively.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Vehicular energy network (VEN), as an important part of the Internet of Things for the smart city, can facilitate the renewable energy (RE) transportation over a large geographical area by means of electric vehicles (EVs) through wireless power transfer technology. However, due to the potential security vulnerability in VEN, EV users can be attacked by external or internal adversaries. In addition, owing to the selfishness of EVs, it is a great challenge to optimally schedule the charging/discharging behaviors of EVs to realize regional energy balance in VEN. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based secure incentive scheme for energy delivery in VEN. First, a novel permissioned energy blockchain system is introduced in VEN to implement secure energy delivery services for EVs and energy nodes through the use of distributed ledgers and cryptocurrency. Second, a proof of reputation consensus protocol is proposed to efficiently reach consensus in energy blockchain, where the reputation derivation is constructed based on the local trust computing and credibility computing. Third, motivated by the pricing mechanism, an incentive model is developed to stimulate EVs to cooperatively deliver RE to various areas with different electricity loads while maximizing EVs' utilities. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided, which demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme through the comparison with conventional schemes.

<p>People who have been tortured while in detention are among our most vulnerable patients. Clinicians who care for these patients might likewise feel vulnerable and ill-equipped to manage the complex health-care needs of victims. Torture and detention on their own have health impacts, but together exact a physical and psychological toll on individuals that can be long-lasting and profound. A third of asylum seekers and over 40% of refugees are estimated to be victims of torture. That health-care delivery can trigger memories of trauma, fear of officials, and mistrust of institutions compounds the challenges clinicians face in caring for people who have been tortured in detention.

<p>On June 20, in collaboration with the International League Against Epilepsy and the International Bureau for Epilepsy, WHO released its first global report on epilepsy calling for urgent actions to prioritise the condition as a public health concern. Epilepsy: A public health imperative highlights major gaps in awareness, diagnosis, treatment, and health policies through a series of appalling numbers. With around 50 million people affected worldwide, epilepsy is one of the most common and serious brain disorders.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Spectrum auction is an effective approach to improve the spectrum utilization, by leasing an idle spectrum from primary users to secondary users. Recently, a few differentially private spectrum auction mechanisms have been proposed, but, as far as we know, none of them addressed the differential privacy in the setting of double spectrum auctions. In this paper, we combine the concept of differential privacy with double spectrum auction design and present a differentially private double spectrum auction mechanism with approximate social welfare maximization (DDSM). Specifically, we design the mechanism by employing the exponential mechanism to select clearing prices for the double spectrum auction with probabilities exponentially proportional to the related social welfare values and then improve the mechanism in several aspects, such as the designs of the auction algorithm, the utility function, and the buyer grouping algorithm. Through theoretical analysis, we prove that DDSM achieves differential privacy, approximate truthfulness, and approximate social welfare maximization. Extensive experimental evaluations show that DDSM achieves a good performance in terms of social welfare.

<p>The two-terminal key agreement problem with biometric or physical identifiers is considered. Two linear code constructions based on Wyner&#x2013;Ziv coding are developed. The first construction uses random linear codes and achieves all points of the key-leakage-storage regions of the generated-secret and chosen-secret models. The second construction uses nested polar codes for vector quantization during enrollment and for error correction during reconstruction. The simulation results show that the nested polar codes achieve privacy leakage and storage rates that improve on existing code designs. One proposed code achieves a rate tuple that cannot be achieved by existing methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Dynamic software watermarking is one of the major countermeasures against software licensing violations. However, conventional dynamic watermarking approaches have exhibited a number of weaknesses including exploitable payload semantics, exploitable embedding/recognition procedures, and weak correlation between payload and subject software. This paper presents a novel dynamic watermarking method, Xmark, which leverages a well-known unsolved mathematical problem referred to as the Collatz conjecture. Our method works by transforming selected conditional constructs (which originally belonged to the software to be watermarked) with a control flow obfuscation technique based on Collatz conjecture. These obfuscation routines are built in a particular way such that they are able to express a watermark in the form of iteratively executed branching activities occurred during computing the aforementioned conjecture. Exploiting the one-to-one correspondence between natural numbers and their orbits computed by the conjecture (also known as the &#x201c;Hailstone sequences&#x201d;), Xmark&#x2019;s watermark-related activities are designed to be insignificant without the pre-defined secret input. Meanwhile, being integrated with obfuscation techniques, our method is able to resist attacks based on various reverse engineering techniques on both syntax and semantic levels. Analyses and simulations indicated that Xmark could evade detections via pattern matching and model checking, and meanwhile effectively prohibit dynamic symbolic execution. We have also shown that our method could remain robust even if a watermarked software is compromised via re-obfuscation using approaches like control flow flattening.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>As the size and source of network traffic increase, so does the challenge of monitoring and analyzing network traffic. Therefore, sampling algorithms are often used to alleviate these scalability issues. However, the use of high entropy data streams, through the use of either encryption or compression, further compounds the challenge as current state-of-the-art algorithms cannot accurately and efficiently differentiate between encrypted and compressed packets. In this paper, we propose a novel traffic classification method named High Entropy DistinGuishEr (HEDGE) to distinguish between compressed and encrypted traffic. HEDGE is based on the evaluation of the randomness of the data streams and can be applied to individual packets without the need to have access to the entire stream. The findings from the evaluation show that our approach outperforms current state of the art. We also make available our statistically sound dataset, based on known benchmarks, to the wider research community.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In public cloud storage services, data are outsourced to semi-trusted cloud servers which are outside of data owners&#x2019; trusted domain. To prevent untrustworthy service providers from accessing data owners&#x2019; sensitive data, outsourced data are often encrypted. In this scenario, conducting access control over these data becomes a challenging issue. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) has been proved to be a powerful cryptographic tool to express access policies over attributes, which can provide a fine-grained, flexible, and secure access control over outsourced data. However, the existing ABE-based access control schemes do not support users to gain access permission by collaboration. In this paper, we explore a special attribute-based access control scenario where multiple users having different attribute sets can collaborate to gain access permission if the data owner allows their collaboration in the access policy. Meanwhile, the collaboration that is not designated in the access policy should be regarded as a collusion and the access request will be denied. We propose an attribute-based controlled collaborative access control scheme through designating translation nodes in the access structure. Security analysis shows that our proposed scheme can guarantee data confidentiality and has many other critical security properties. Extensive performance analysis shows that our proposed scheme is efficient in terms of storage and computation overhead.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a variable structure speed controller (VSSC) that guarantees the robust transient performance against the external disturbances and parameter uncertainties of an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive. Unlike the conventional VSSC applied to the IPMSMs, the proposed nonlinear compensating control term not only assures the robustness against the system uncertainties, but also implements the maximum torque per ampere technique. Furthermore, the convergence and stability of the proposed VSSC are fully proven through the Lyapunov theory by introducing reasonable bounded uncertainties which determine a feasible range for the system dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is investigated through the simulation using MATLAB/Simulink and experiment using a prototype IPMSM drive system with a TI TMS320F28335 DSP. Finally, the proposed VSSC can ensure faster and more robust transient response than the conventional proportional-integral speed controller under the dynamic load conditions including the uncertainties.
