<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Despite their tremendous success in a wide range of applications, deep neural
network (DNN) models are inherently vulnerable to two types of malicious
manipulations: adversarial inputs, which are crafted samples that deceive
target DNNs, and backdoored models, which are forged DNNs that misbehave on
trigger-embedded inputs. While prior work has intensively studied the two
attack vectors in parallel, there is still a lack of understanding about their
fundamental connection, which is critical for assessing the holistic
vulnerability of DNNs deployed in realistic settings.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we bridge this gap by conducting the first systematic study of
the two attack vectors within a unified framework. More specifically, (i) we
develop a new attack model that integrates both adversarial inputs and
backdoored models; (ii) with both analytical and empirical evidence, we reveal
that there exists an intricate "mutual reinforcement" effect between the two
attack vectors; (iii) we demonstrate that this effect enables a large spectrum
for the adversary to optimize the attack strategies, such as maximizing attack
evasiveness with respect to various defenses and designing trigger patterns
satisfying multiple desiderata; (v) finally, we discuss potential
countermeasures against this unified attack and their technical challenges,
which lead to several promising research directions.

<p>Automatic speaker verification (ASV) is one of the most natural and
convenient means of biometric person recognition. Unfortunately, just like all
other biometric systems, ASV is vulnerable to spoofing, also referred to as
''presentation attacks.'' These vulnerabilities are generally unacceptable and
call for spoofing countermeasures or "presentation attack detection" systems.
In addition to impersonation, ASV systems are vulnerable to replay, speech
synthesis, and voice conversion attacks. The ASVspoof 2019 edition is the first
to consider all three spoofing attack types within a single challenge. While
they originate from the same source database and same underlying protocol, they
are explored in two specific use case scenarios. Spoofing attacks within a
logical access (LA) scenario are generated with the latest speech synthesis and
voice conversion technologies, including state-of-the-art neural acoustic and
waveform model techniques. Replay spoofing attacks within a physical access
(PA) scenario are generated through carefully controlled simulations that
support much more revealing analysis than possible previously. Also new to the
2019 edition is the use of the tandem detection cost function metric, which
reflects the impact of spoofing and countermeasures on the reliability of a
fixed ASV system. This paper describes the database design, protocol, spoofing
attack implementations, and baseline ASV and countermeasure results. It also
describes a human assessment on spoofed data in logical access. It was
demonstrated that the spoofing data in the ASVspoof 2019 database have varied
degrees of perceived quality and similarity to the target speakers, including
spoofed data that cannot be differentiated from bona-fide utterances even by
human subjects.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Speaker recognition (SR) is widely used in our daily life as a biometric
authentication mechanism. The popularity of SR brings in serious security
concerns, as demonstrated by recent adversarial attacks. However, the impacts
of such threats in the practical black-box setting are still open, since
current attacks consider the white-box setting only.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive and systematic study of the
adversarial attacks on SR systems (SRSs) to understand their security weakness
in the practical black-box setting. For this purpose, we propose an adversarial
attack, named FakeBob, to craft adversarial samples. Specifically, we formulate
the adversarial sample generation as an optimization problem, incorporated with
the confidence of adversarial samples and maximal distortion to balance between
the strength and imperceptibility of adversarial voices. One key contribution
is to propose a novel algorithm to estimate the score threshold, a feature in
SRSs, and use it in the optimization problem to solve the optimization problem.
We demonstrate that FakeBob achieves close to 100% targeted attack success rate
on both open-source and commercial systems. We further demonstrate that FakeBob
is also effective (at least 65% untargeted success rate) on both open-source
and commercial systems when playing over the air in the physical world.
Moreover, we have conducted a human study which reveals that it is hard for
human to differentiate the speakers of the original and adversarial voices.
Last but not least, we show that three promising defense methods for
adversarial attack from the speech recognition domain become ineffective on
SRSs against FakeBob, which calls for more effective defense methods. We
highlight that our study peeks into the security implications of adversarial
attacks on SRSs, and realistically fosters to improve the security robustness
of SRSs.

<p>In recent years Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable results
and even showed super-human capabilities in a broad range of domains. This led
people to trust in DNNs' classifications and resulting actions even in
security-sensitive environments like autonomous driving.
</p>
<p>Despite their impressive achievements, DNNs are known to be vulnerable to
adversarial examples. Such inputs contain small perturbations to intentionally
fool the attacked model.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end framework to detect such attacks
during classification without influencing the target model's performance.
Inspired by recent research in neuron-coverage guided testing we show that
dense layers of DNNs carry security-sensitive information. With a secondary DNN
we analyze the activation patterns of the dense layers during classification
runtime, which enables effective and real-time detection of adversarial
examples.
</p>
<p>Our prototype implementation successfully detects adversarial examples in
image, natural language, and audio processing. Thereby, we cover a variety of
target DNNs, including Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architectures. In
addition, to effectively defend against state-of-the-art attacks, our approach
generalizes between different sets of adversarial examples. Thus, our method
most likely enables us to detect even future, yet unknown attacks. Finally,
during white-box adaptive attacks, we show our method cannot be easily
bypassed.

<p>We describe and evaluate an attack that reconstructs the histogram of any
target attribute of a sensitive dataset which can only be queried through a
specific class of real-world privacy-preserving algorithms which we call
bounded perturbation algorithms. A defining property of such an algorithm is
that it perturbs answers to the queries by adding zero-mean noise distributed
within a bounded (possibly undisclosed) range. Other key properties of the
algorithm include only allowing restricted queries (enforced via an online
interface), suppressing answers to queries which are only satisfied by a small
group of individuals (e.g., by returning a zero as an answer), and adding the
same perturbation to two queries which are satisfied by the same set of
individuals (to thwart differencing or averaging attacks). A real-world example
of such an algorithm is the one deployed by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics' (ABS) online tool called TableBuilder, which allows users to create
tables, graphs and maps of Australian census data [30]. We assume an attacker
(say, a curious analyst) who is given oracle access to the algorithm via an
interface. We describe two attacks on the algorithm. Both attacks are based on
carefully constructing (different) queries that evaluate to the same answer.
The first attack finds the hidden perturbation parameter $r$ (if it is assumed
not to be public knowledge). The second attack removes the noise to obtain the
original answer of some (counting) query of choice. We also show how to use
this attack to find the number of individuals in the dataset with a target
attribute value $a$ of any attribute $A$, and then for all attribute values
$a_i \in A$. Our attacks are a practical illustration of the (informal)
fundamental law of information recovery which states that ``overly accurate
estimates of too many statistics completely destroys privacy'' [9, 15].

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Most of the existing finite-control-set model predictive current control (FCS-MPCC) schemes for multi-phase motor suffer from heavy computational burden, inevitable low-order harmonic currents, and variable switching frequencies. Some virtual voltage vector (V<sup>3</sup>)-based FCS-MPCC schemes can effectively suppress harmonic current by zeroing the harmonic subspace voltage on average during one sampling period. However, they fail when the motor has a nonsinusoidal back electromotive force. In order to solve the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a constant switching frequency multiple-vector-based FCS-MPCC scheme. Unlike the traditional FCS-MPCC schemes, the proposed scheme selects optimal V<sup>3</sup>s and their duty ratios in two orthogonal subspaces. Thus, it can simultaneously track the references in both orthogonal subspaces. In this approach, the optimal V<sup>3</sup>s and their duty ratios are directly obtained from the principle of deadbeat current control without time-consuming enumeration-based state predictions and cost function calculations. In addition, the obtained optimal V<sup>3</sup>s and their duty ratios are adopted to rearrange the pulse sequence to obtain constant switching frequency and can be simply synthesized by carrier-based pulsewidth modulation. Furthermore, a discrete time disturbance observer is designed to improve the robustness of the proposed FCS-MPCC against parameter mismatch. Finally, comparative experiments with traditional MPCC schemes for five-phase surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous machine are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In $LCL$-type grid-tied inverters, the lumped disturbance, including parameter uncertainties, unmodeled dynamics, and grid harmonics, will deteriorate the current tracking performance and lead to high total harmonic distortion (THD). The uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE) scheme provides an effective way to attenuate the lumped disturbance. However, UDE for the current control in $LCL$-type grid-tied inverters is far from perfect. In this paper, a discrete-time modified UDE (MUDE) scheme is proposed to improve the current tracking performance and robustness. In MUDE, a reduced-order model of the $LCL$ filter, combined with an active damping scheme, is proposed. The stability performance is discussed in detail, and a rigorous stability condition is proposed for the first time. Moreover, the analysis of the controller sampling frequency and grid impedance, and their influences on the system stability is presented. A design case based on the stability condition is also given. Comparative experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, the noncooperative optimal control problem is investigated for a class of discrete time-varying networked control systems subject to exogenous nonlinear disturbances. To relive the transmission burden in the sensor-to-controller channel, the Round-Robin protocol is adopted to schedule the sensor transmissions. On the other hand, the controller operates in an event-triggered manner so as to reduce the transmission frequency and thereby preserving the energy in the controller-to-actuator channel. In the presence of the underlying scheduling and triggering mechanism, it is literally impossible to acquire the accurate value of the individual cost function for each controller and, as an effective alternative, a certain upper bound is derived on the individual cost function. Then, in virtue of the completing-the-square technique and the Moore&#x2013;Penrose pseudo inverse, such an upper bound is minimized at each time instant. Furthermore, a sufficient condition is established to guarantee the boundedness of the derived upper bound over the infinite horizon. Finally, a numerical example on the power grid is provided to verify the validity of the proposed methodology.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The screen content (SC) pictures, such as webpages, serve as a visible and convenient medium to well-represent the Internet information, and therefore, the visual quality of SC pictures is highly significant and has attained a growing amount of attention. Accurate quality evaluation of SC pictures not only provides the fidelity of the conveyed information, but also contributes to the improvement of the user experience. In practical applications, a reliable estimation of SC pictures plays a considerably critical role for the optimization of the processing systems as the guidance. Based on these motivations, this paper proposes a novel method for precisely assessing the quality of SC pictures using very sparse reference information. Specifically, the proposed quality method separately extracts the macroscopic and microscopic structures, followed by comparing the differences of macroscopic and microscopic features between a pristine SC picture and its corrupted version to infer the overall quality score. By studying the feature histogram for dimensionality reduction, the proposed method merely requires two features as the reference information that can be exactly embedded in the file header with very few bits. Experiments manifest the superiority of our algorithm as compared with state-of-the-art relevant quality metrics when applied to the visual quality evaluation of SC pictures.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To optimize control and/or state estimation of industrial processes, information about measurement quality provided by sensors is required. In this paper, a probabilistic scheme is proposed in discrete-time nonlinear state space with the purpose of sensor monitoring. A quantitative index representing the measurement quality, as well as satisfied state estimates, is obtained by estimating the probability density functions (PDFs) of the states and the measurement noise covariance considered as a random variable using the variational Bayesian approach. To solve the intractable integrals of nonlinear PDFs in real time, a set of weighted particles is generated to overlap an empirical density of state, while the PDF of the measurement noise is still derived analytically. An example of localization and an experiment with a rotary flexible joint are supplied to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the applicability of existing methods and can monitor correlated sensors satisfactorily.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In a companion Part I paper, we presented a framework for analyzing robustness of color control functions (CCFs) for multiprimary displays against primary and observer variations and proposed a variational minimization for obtaining robust CCFs. The objective function proposed in the Part I paper combines two nonnegative terms that serve as useful figures of merit for quantitatively characterizing CCFs. The first term measures lack of smoothness of the CCFs and characterizes how well transitions in perceptual color space are preserved in the presence of the primary/observer variations. The second term measures deviation of the CCF, in the vicinity of the gray axis, from a specific axially linear CCF that provides perceptual invariance to the variations along the gray axis. In this paper, using calculus of variations, we develop an algorithm for numerically computing optimal CCFs under the proposed variational formulation. Using the proposed algorithm, we determine optimal CCFs for a several multiprimary display designs and assess and compare their performance against alternative approaches. The variationally optimal CCFs obtained using the proposed approach offer improvements over the alternatives, as assessed visually and via quantitative metrics measuring smoothness and invariance in the presence of primary variations. The relative improvements provided by the proposed CCF increase with increasing number of primaries.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Block partition structure is a critical module in video coding scheme to achieve significant gap of compression performance. Under the exploration of the future video coding standard, named Versatile Video Coding (VVC), a new Quad Tree Binary Tree (QTBT) block partition structure has been introduced. In addition to the QT block partitioning defined in High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard, new horizontal and vertical BT partitions are enabled, which drastically increases the encoding time compared to HEVC. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and tunable QTBT partitioning scheme based on a Machine Learning (ML) approach. The proposed solution uses Random Forest classifiers to determine for each coding block the most probable partition modes. To minimize the encoding loss induced by misclassification, risk intervals for classifier decisions are introduced in the proposed solution. By varying the size of risk intervals, tunable trade-off between encoding complexity reduction and coding loss is achieved. The proposed solution implemented in the JEM-7.0 software offers encoding complexity reductions ranging from 30&#x0025; to 70&#x0025; in average for only 0.7&#x0025; to 3.0&#x0025; Bj&#x00f8;ntegaard Delta Rate (BD-BR) increase in Random Access (RA) coding configuration, with very slight overhead induced by Random Forest. The proposed solution based on Random Forest classifiers is also efficient to reduce the complexity of the Multi-Type Tree (MTT) partitioning scheme under the VTM-5.0 software, with complexity reductions ranging from 25&#x0025; to 61&#x0025; in average for only 0.4&#x0025; to 2.2&#x0025; BD-BR increase.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In the past decade, various unsupervised hashing methods have been developed for cross-modal retrieval. However, in real-world applications, it is often the incomplete case that every modality of data may suffer from some missing samples. Most existing works assume that every object appears in both modalities, hence they may not work well for partial multi-modal data. To address this problem, we propose a novel Collective Affinity Learning Method (CALM), which collectively and adaptively learns an anchor graph for generating binary codes on partial multi-modal data. In CALM, we first construct modality-specific bipartite graphs collectively, and derive a probabilistic model to figure out complete data-to-anchor affinities for each modality. Theoretical analysis reveals its ability to recover missing adjacency information. Moreover, a robust model is proposed to fuse these modality-specific affinities by adaptively learning a unified anchor graph. Then, the neighborhood information from the learned anchor graph acts as feedback, which guides the previous affinity reconstruction procedure. To solve the formulated optimization problem, we further develop an effective algorithm with linear time complexity and fast convergence. Last, Anchor Graph Hashing (AGH) is conducted on the fused affinities for cross-modal retrieval. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our proposed CALM consistently outperforms the existing methods.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To the Editor Dr Subir&#224; and colleagues evaluated 2 types of SBTs to evaluate readiness for extubation, a short-duration (30-minute) PSV strategy compared with a long-duration (2-hour) T-piece strategy, and found higher extubation rates with the PSV strategy (82.3% vs 74.0% at 72 hours; 92.5% vs 84.1% after the first SBT), with no difference in reintubation rates within 72 hours of extubation (11.1% vs 11.9%). Surprisingly, patients underwent their first SBT when the pretest probability of successful separation from the ventilator was already extremely high (as indicated by the success rate of the trial). When the pretest probability is high, any test or strategy having a risk of false-negative results (ie, predicting failure in a patient who could be extubated) will compromise predictive performance, whereas the risk of false-positive results (ie, predicting success in a patient who cannot be extubated) will be almost nonexistent. The design of this study put the T-piece group at higher risk of false-negative results than the PSV group. The results were therefore expected, as predicted by Bayes&#8217; theorem. The relevant question for clinical practice is why the authors included patients at a late stage when the pretest probability of extubation was already high. Moreover, the absence of differences in length of stay in the intensive care unit casts doubt on any inference that the 30-minute PSV strategy meaningfully accelerated liberation from mechanical ventilation.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In the Original Investigation entitled &#8220;Switching to Another SSRI or to Venlafaxine With or Without Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adolescents With SSRI-Resistant Depression: the TORDIA Randomized Controlled Trial,&#8221; published in the February 27, 2008, issue of JAMA, the coding used for the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire-Jr was incorrect. The scale ranges from 0 to 6; we had coded the scores on a scale from 1 to 7, which inflated the total scores. The resulting means, CIs, and cut point for clinical significance were incorrect. The data in Table 1, the Results section, and Table 4 were affected, but the errors did not affect the conclusions or interpretations of the study. A letter of explanation has been published and this article has been corrected online.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Medical training and clinical practice are continuously associated with stress&#8212;often welcomed and considered a positive motivating factor. However, the recently recognised triad of emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation, and reduced professional efficacy, defined as burnout, questions the role of stress in clinical practice. Burnout has the propensity to put patient care at risk and has a detrimental effect on medical workforce retainment. A health-care system under pressure undoubtably contributes to professional burnout: long working hours, outdated and not fit-for-purpose technologies, and mounting documentation requirements shift the focus away from patient care, causing work&#8211;life imbalance, insufficient job resources, ineffective multidisciplinary teams, and a dismissive organisational culture.

<p>An estimated 15 million babies are born prematurely, before 37 weeks of gestation, every year worldwide. Of those, about 5&#8211;6% are born extremely prematurely, before 28 weeks of gestation. Progress in the perinatal care of these babies has continued to improve outcomes in high-income countries. The British Association of Perinatal Medicine has issued new guidance, Perinatal Management of Extreme Preterm Birth before 27 weeks of gestation. For example, even at the lowest end of viability, at 22 weeks of gestation, 30% of those babies who were given active treatment survived to discharge in cohort studies from Sweden, the US, and Germany.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Massive MIMO attains high spectral and power efficiency transmission by leveraging a large number of transmit antennas. However, to capture the benefits of massive MIMO, each antenna should be accompanied with a dedicated RF chain, and consequently, the hardware costs would scale up tremendously with the increase of the antennas. Cheap implementations of massive MIMO have recently gained considerable attention, and constant modulus (CM) signaling is seen as a promising solution, owing to its low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). This paper investigates the physical-layer (PHY) security in massive MIMO with an emphasis on the CM signaling. In particular, we consider a transmitter with massive antennas broadcast common confidential information to a group of legitimate receivers, and a number of eavesdroppers overhear the transmission and attempt to intercept the information. Our goal is to design the CM beamforming at the transmitter so that the multicast secrecy rate is maximized. This secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is generally NP-hard. To tackle it, two tractable approaches are developed. The first one employs the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique and the Charnes-Copper transformation to obtain a convex relaxation of the SRM problem. However, due to the dimension lifting of SDR, this approach is feasible only for small to medium antenna sizes. The second approach leverages the Dinkelbach method to work directly over the beamformer domain; a custom-build nonconvex alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed to efficiently perform each Dinkelbach update. Simulation results demonstrate that the second approach is computationally more efficient and can achieve nearly optimal performance when the number of antennas is large.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In practice, the Template Attack (TA) is widely accepted as the strongest side channel attack, and it is used to evaluate the physical security of crypto devices in practice. In TA, different statistical tools, such as the Euclidean distance (ED) and the Mahalanobis distance (MD), can be used to recover the secret key used by the target device. In practice, values of different parameters influence the key-recovery efficiency of TA. However, until now, the exact relationship between the success rate (SR) of TA and different parameters is not very clear. Therefore, in order to accurately evaluate the physical security of crypto devices with TA, evaluators need to vary values of different parameters and empirically evaluate the SR of TA in different cases. Considering that both the computational complexity and the measurement complexity of the empirical evaluation are high, this may induce unnecessary evaluation overhead and make the evaluation period long. In light of this, in this paper, the exact relationship between the SR of TA and values of different parameters is theoretically analyzed, and the soundness of the theoretical analysis is empirically verified in both simulated and real scenarios. Then, by setting the values of different parameters, the SR of TA can be accurately and efficiently estimated. Overall, this contribution may help evaluators to efficiently evaluate the physical security of crypto devices with TA in practice.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The side-channel leakage is a consequence of program execution in a computer processor, and understanding relationship between code execution and information leakage is a necessary step in estimating information leakage and its capacity limits. This paper proposes a methodology to relate program execution to electromagnetic side-channel emanations and estimates side-channel information capacity created by execution of series of instructions (e.g., a function, a procedure, or a program) in a processor. To model dependence among program instructions in a code, we propose to use Markov source model, which includes the dependencies among sequence of instructions as well as dependencies among instructions as they pass through a pipeline of the processor. The emitted electromagnetic (EM) signals during instruction executions are natural choice for the inputs into the model. To obtain the channel inputs for the proposed model, we derive a mathematical relationship between the emanated instruction signal power (ESP) and total emanated signal power while running a program. Then, we derive the leakage capacity of EM side channels created by execution of series of instructions in a processor. Finally, we provide experimental results to demonstrate that leakages could be severe and that a dedicated attacker could obtain important information.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the optimal tradeoff between secrecy and non-secrecy rates of the MISO wiretap channels for different power constraint settings: sum power constraint only, per-antenna power constraints only, and joint sum and per-antenna power constraints. The problem is motivated by the fact that channel capacity and secrecy capacity are generally achieved by different transmit strategies. First, a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure a positive secrecy capacity is shown. The optimal tradeoff between secrecy rate and transmission rate is characterized by a weighted rate sum maximization problem. Since this problem is not necessarily convex, equivalent problem formulations are introduced to derive the optimal transmit strategies. Under sum power constraint only, a closed-form solution is provided. Under per-antenna power constraints, necessary conditions to find the optimal power allocation are derived. Sufficient conditions are provided for the special case of two transmit antennas. For the special case of aligned channels, the optimal transmit strategies can deduced from an equivalent point-to-point channel problem. Last, the theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel deep sparse coding network (SCN) capable of efficiently adapting its own regularization parameters for a given application. The network is trained end-to-end with a supervised task-driven learning algorithm via error backpropagation. During training, the network learns both the dictionaries and the regularization parameters of each sparse coding layer so that the reconstructive dictionaries are smoothly transformed into increasingly discriminative representations. In addition, the adaptive regularization also offers the network more flexibility to adjust sparsity levels. Furthermore, we have devised a sparse coding layer utilizing a &#x201c;skinny&#x201d; dictionary. Integral to computational efficiency, these skinny dictionaries compress the high-dimensional sparse codes into lower dimensional structures. The adaptivity and discriminability of our 15-layer SCN are demonstrated on six benchmark datasets, namely Cifar-10, Cifar-100, STL-10, SVHN, MNIST, and ImageNet, most of which are considered difficult for sparse coding models. Experimental results show that our architecture overwhelmingly outperforms traditional one-layer sparse coding architectures while using much fewer parameters. Moreover, our multilayer architecture exploits the benefits of depth with sparse coding's characteristic ability to operate on smaller datasets. In such data-constrained scenarios, our technique demonstrates a highly competitive performance compared with the deep neural networks.

<p>We propose an algorithm to efficiently compute approximate solutions of the piecewise affine Mumford-Shah model. The algorithm is based on a novel reformulation of the underlying optimization problem in terms of Taylor jets. A splitting approach leads to linewise segmented jet estimation problems for which we propose an exact and efficient solver. The proposed method has the combined advantages of prior algorithms: it directly yields a partition, it does not need an initialization procedure, and it is highly parallelizable. The experiments show that the algorithm has lower computation times and that the solutions often have lower functional values than the state-of-the-art.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Understanding potential behaviors of attackers is of paramount importance for improving the cybersecurity of power systems. However, the attack behaviors in existing studies are often modeled statically on a single snapshot, which neglects the reality of a dynamically time-evolving power system. Accordingly, a dynamic cyber-attack model with local network information is proposed to characterize the typical data injection attack with the integration of potential dynamic behaviors of an attacker. The proposed model collaboratively alters the meter measurement in a stealthy way to illegally contaminate the system state, thus posing severe threats to cyber physical power systems. We then develop a novel anomaly detection countermeasure from the perspective of state estimation to effectively recognize the dynamic injection attack. In this countermeasure, an interval state forecasting method is proposed to approximate the possible largest variation bounds of each state variable based on a worst-case analysis considering the forecasting uncertainties of renewable energy sources, electric loads, and network parameter perturbations. In addition, the kernel quantile regression is introduced and implemented to formulate the uncertainties in renewable energy and electric load forecast as a series of confidence intervals. When any state variable falls outside its preforecasted intervals, the proposed countermeasure detects the anomaly and sets an alarm condition indicating the possibility of data contamination. Finally, the results from our extensive studies on several IEEE standard test systems have been presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the dynamic attack and the effectiveness of the detection countermeasure.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the rapid development of the internet of things (IoT), connected vehicles are set to become a huge industry over the next few years. In this study, we take an investigation of the distributed intelligent traffic system by pushing intelligence into connected vehicles in terms of dynamic decision making for traversing a certain area (e.g., roundabout and intersection). In particular, we propose a model for the next generation of intelligent transportation system, which focuses on dynamic decision making of connected vehicles based on Ant Colony Optimization, a typical Swarm Intelligence (SI)-based algorithm. Specifically, we first present a communication framework among connected vehicles for sharing information of traffic flow. Then, by applying the concept of SI, connected vehicles are regarded as artificial ants which are able to self-calculate to make an adaptive decision following the dynamics of traffic flow. Furthermore, for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we have constructed a framework to model and simulate the traffic system in IoT environment. Simulations with different scenarios of transportation systems indicate promising results comparing with previous works.

We start by maximizing the data rate of cellular transmissions under the maximum transmit power constraint of the cellular users, to obtain the optimal beamforming vectors. Using these vectors, we propose a water filling based data segmentation approach for content distribution. Furthermore, within the CMC, we design cost-effective resource allocation and power control mechanisms for device-to-device communications. Through performance comparisons, we disclose that our proposed scheme outperforms some previous study in terms of delay and energy consumption per mobile terminal, which further validates the effectiveness of our design.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Duplicated data storage wastes memory resources and brings extra data-management load and cost to cloud service providers (CSPs). Various feasible schemes to deduplicate encrypted cloud data have been reported. However, their successful deployment in practice depends on whether all system players or stakeholders are willing to accept and execute them in a cooperative way, which was scarcely investigated in the previous literature. In this paper, we employ a noncooperative game to model the interactions in a client-side server-controlled deduplication scheme (S-DEDU) and construct an incentive mechanism based on payment discount to motivate its final acceptance. The experimental results based on a real-world dataset demonstrate the individual rationality, incentive compatibility, profitability, and robustness of our incentive mechanism.

<p>A team of researchers from the SingHealth Duke-NUS Academic Medicine Centre's Viral Research and Experimental Medicine Centre (ViREMiCS) found that immune cells undergoing stress and an altered metabolism are the reasons why some individuals become sick from viral infections while others do not, when exposed to the same virus.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>New research brings to light for the first time the evolution of maternal roles and parenting responsibilities in one of our oldest evolutionary ancestors. Australopithecus africanus mothers breastfed their infants for the first 12 months after birth, and continued to supplement their diets with breastmilk during periods of food shortage. Tooth chemistry analyses enable scientists to 'read' more than two-million-year-old teeth. Finding demonstrates why early human ancestors had fewer offspring and extended parenting role.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A new study led by Dr. Antonella Fioravanti in the lab of Prof. Han Remaut (VIB-VUB Center for Structural Biology) has shown that removing the armor of the bacterium that causes anthrax slows its growth and negatively affects its ability to cause disease. This work will be published in the prestigious journal Nature Microbiology can lead the way to new, effective ways of fighting anthrax and various other diseases.
