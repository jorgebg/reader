<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose a text steganographic scheme based on color coding
and permutation. Given a secret message and a cover text, the proposed scheme
embed the secret message in the cover text by making it colored, using a
permutation algorithm. The stego-text is then send to the receiver by mail. The
results which have been obtained by experiments, show that our model performs a
better hiding process in terms of hiding capacity as compared to the scheme of
Aruna Malik et al. on which our idea is based.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The cross-blockchain transaction remains one of the most challenging problems
in blockchains. The root cause of the challenge lies in the nondeterministic
nature of blockchains: A transaction across multiple blockchains might be
partially rolled back due to the potential forks in any of the participating
blockchains---eventually, only one fork will survive in the competition among
miners. While some effort has recently been made to developing hierarchically
distributed commit protocols to make multi-party transactions progress, there
is no systematic method to reason about the transaction results. This paper
tackles this problem from a perspective of point-set topology. We construct
multiple topology spaces for the transactions and blockchain forks, and show
that these spaces are internally related through either homeomorphism or
continuous functions. Combined together, these tools allow us to reason about
the cross-blockchain transactions through the growing-fork topology, an
intuitive representation of blockchains. As of writing, this paper is the first
study on point-set topological properties of blockchains.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of extensively used techniques in a
network topology to safeguard the integrity and availability of sensitive
assets in the protected systems. Although many supervised and unsupervised
learning approaches from the field of machine learning have been used to
increase the efficacy of IDSs, it is still a problem for existing intrusion
detection algorithms to achieve good performance. First, lots of redundant and
irrelevant data in high-dimensional datasets interfere with the classification
process of an IDS. Second, an individual classifier may not perform well in the
detection of each type of attacks. Third, many models are built for stale
datasets, making them less adaptable for novel attacks. Thus, we propose a new
intrusion detection framework in this paper, and this framework is based on the
feature selection and ensemble learning techniques. In the first step, a
heuristic algorithm called CFS-BA is proposed for dimensionality reduction,
which selects the optimal subset based on the correlation between features.
Then, we introduce an ensemble approach that combines C4.5, Random Forest (RF),
and Forest by Penalizing Attributes (Forest PA) algorithms. Finally, voting
technique is used to combine the probability distributions of the base learners
for attack recognition. The experimental results, using NSL-KDD, AWID, and
CIC-IDS2017 datasets, reveal that the proposed CFS-BA-Ensemble method is able
to exhibit better performance than other related and state of the art
approaches under several metrics.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent works showed the vulnerability of image classifiers to adversarial
attacks in the digital domain. However, the majority of attacks involve adding
small perturbation to an image to fool the classifier. Unfortunately, such
procedures can not be used to conduct a real-world attack, where adding an
adversarial attribute to the photo is a more practical approach. In this paper,
we study the problem of real-world attacks on face recognition systems. We
examine security of one of the best public face recognition systems,
LResNet100E-IR with ArcFace loss, and propose a simple method to attack it in
the physical world. The method suggests creating an adversarial patch that can
be printed, added as a face attribute and photographed; the photo of a person
with such attribute is then passed to the classifier such that the classifier's
recognized class changes from correct to the desired one. Proposed generating
procedure allows projecting adversarial patches not only on different areas of
the face, such as nose or forehead but also on some wearable accessory, such as
eyeglasses.

<p>Modern autonomous driving systems rely heavily on deep learning models to
process point cloud sensory data; meanwhile, deep models have been shown to be
susceptible to adversarial attacks with visually imperceptible perturbations.
Despite the fact that this poses a security concern for the self-driving
industry, there has been very little exploration in terms of 3D perception, as
most adversarial attacks have only been applied to 2D flat images. In this
paper, we address this issue and present a method to generate universal 3D
adversarial objects to fool LiDAR detectors. In particular, we demonstrate that
placing an adversarial object on the rooftop of any target vehicle to hide the
vehicle entirely from LiDAR detectors with a success rate of 80%. We report
attack results on a suite of detectors using various input representation of
point clouds. We also conduct a pilot study on adversarial defense using data
augmentation. This is one step closer towards safer self-driving under unseen
conditions from limited training data.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The problem of inefficient and unevenly distributed spectrum usage in industrial wireless networks has led to the emergence of the concept of industrial cognitive radio (CR) networks, which have particularly important applications in automotive industry. Industrial CR networks are planned to function in a wide spectrum range; therefore, they have high energy consumption because of frequency switching while other wireless technologies do not have this problem. A distinctive feature of this switching cost is that it depends on the wideness between the two frequency bands. In this article, we formulate the joint frequency assignment and scheduling problem for multihop industrial CR networks with a single transceiver by considering varying amounts of energy consumption that occurs while CR devices switch to different frequency bands. Our optimization problem, which we formulate as an integer linear program, minimizes the energy cost related to frequency switching while making frequency and time slot allocation to the cognitive devices. We prove that even on star graphs, our formulated problem is inapproximable within any polynomial-time computable function $f(n)$ in addition to being $textsc {NP}text {-Hard}$ in the strong sense. Therefore, we propose a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm to solve the energy consumption problem due to channel switching. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of our heuristic algorithm is very close to the results obtained from the integer linear programming implementation by CPLEX optimization software. We also compare our proposed method with the corresponding constant energy consumption for frequency switching case and two state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrate that taking into account the different energy consumption while switching to different frequency bands -
s vital for joint frequency assignment and scheduling in multihop industrial CR networks with a single transceiver.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Poor signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and low spatial resolutions have impeded low-cost pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensors from many intelligent applications for thermal target detection/recognition. This article presents a cognitive signal conditioning and modulation learning framework for PIR sensing with the following two innovations to solve these problems: 1) a reconfigurable signal conditioning circuit design to achieve high SNRs and 2) an optimal sensor mask design to achieve high recognition performance. By using a programmable system on chip, the PIR signal amplifier gain and filter bandwidth can be adjusted automatically according to working conditions. Based on the modeling between PIR physics and thermal images, sensor masks can be optimized through training convolution neural networks with large thermal image datasets for feature extraction of specific thermal targets. The experimental results verify the improved performance of PIR sensors in various working conditions and applications by using the developed reconfigurable circuit and application-specific masks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, we present a metaheuristic-based control framework, called beetle antennae olfactory recurrent neural network, for simultaneous tracking control and obstacle avoidance of a redundant manipulator. The ability to avoid obstacles while tracking a predefined reference path is critical for any industrial manipulator. The formulated control framework unifies the tracking control and obstacle avoidance into a single constrained optimization problem by introducing a penalty term into the objective function, which actively rewards the optimizer for avoiding the obstacles. One of the significant features of the proposed framework is the way that the penalty term is formulated following a straightforward principle: maximize the minimum distance between a manipulator and an obstacle. The distance calculations are based on Gilbert&#x2013;Johnson&#x2013;Keerthi algorithm, which calculates the distance between a manipulator and an obstacle by directly using their three-dimensional geometries, which also implies that our algorithm works for a manipulator and an arbitrarily shaped obstacle. Theoretical treatment proves the stability and convergence, and simulations results using an LBR IIWA seven-DOF manipulator are presented to analyze the performance of the proposed framework.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, we investigate code-oriented partitioning computation offloading strategy for multiple user equipments (UEs) and multiple mobile edge computing servers with limited resources (i.e., limited computing power and waiting task queues with finite capacity). This article aims to develop an offloading strategy to decide the execution location, CPU frequency, and transmission power for UE while minimizing the execution overhead (i.e., a weighted sum of energy consumption and computational time) of UE&#x0027;s applications, which is an NP-hard problem. To achieve the objective, first, we transform the problem into a convex optimization problem and find the optimal solution. Second, we propose a decentralized computation offloading strategy (DCOS) algorithm for UE, and define a dictionary data structure for recording the strategy of the UE to reduce the algorithm complexity. Finally, the effectiveness of DCOS, and the impact of various key parameters on the strategy and overhead are demonstrated by simulation experiments.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, we consider the security problem for the consensus-based distributed state estimation. To resist the malicious attacker who can falsify the data transmitted through the wireless channel, each node equips with an attack defender, which is based on the measurement of its built-in sensor. Under the stealthy attack, which can deceive the defender, we investigate the resilience and convergence of the distributed estimation in two different attack scenarios. For the attack with enough communication resources, we provide a sufficient condition of the optimal attack to quantify the maximum estimation performance degradation. We also analyze the resilience of the worst case distributed estimation caused by the attacker. For the attack with limited resources, the optimal Kalman gain for each node is derived to maximize its estimation performance under the attack. We also give a sufficient condition to guarantee the convergence of the distributed estimation in this case. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effect of the defender on guaranteeing the resilience of sensor networks against attacks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Digital power management systems allow power converters to operate with multiple changes in voltage reference. This asks for a new paradigm that shifts from achieving faster response to achieving best efficiency during multiple transients, with transient being eventually time constrained. State-space-based design of the control system fits perfectly this goal, since it is a time-domain design tool. It can further be enhanced with a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) optimization, configured with converter loss equation as cost function. The LQR mathematics guarantees a solution to the algebraic Riccati equation that produces the best system efficiency for the converter system during multiple transients. This article documents the design of the LQR control system having converter loss as a cost function and demonstrates the advantages of this method. The closed-loop control software yields very simple, running with a 250 kHz sampling frequency capability on a general use Microchip microcontroller platform. While a loss reduction of 2.5&#x0025; is demonstrated by experiment in our setup, the advantage depends on the actual system work profile.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This article introduces the analytic modeling optimal control method in details, aiming at solving special control problems of pulsed power supply for heavy-ion accelerator magnet. These problems include variable waveform, high speed, high precision, and wide dynamic range. To meet these requirements, this method has been proposed as a new choice. The mathematical model is analytic function, which is concerned with the continuous dynamics during topology switching period. Moreover, based on the analytic function, the optimal duty cycle can be calculated by high-performance controller. In simulations, compared with PID regulation, this method has a better ability to track a reference waveform which has a wide dynamic range. Meanwhile, we have made simulations with two magnets and four reference waveforms. The current can be controlled to the reference value at the end of each switching cycle. In experiments, the current of power supply can track above four reference waveforms and the maximum rate of current change is 8000&#x00a0;A/s. There is an excellent agreement between the results of experiments and simulations. Therefore, this control method has been verified.

This letter first demonstrates the delay issue at length. Then, a new direct compensation method, by predicting the current variation within the delay time, is proposed. In comparison with the traditional two-step prediction strategy, the novel method is also easy to implement and can single out the best switching state in each period for optimal control.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A high-frequency (HF) voltage injection method can accurately estimate the rotor position of an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor at low speed. However, the fixed injection frequency for the traditional HF voltage injection method will produce a loud audible noise that limits the actual application of HF voltage injection method. In order to reduce the audible noise, a novel HF square-wave voltage injection method with the random switching frequency is proposed in this article. The frequency of the injected HF voltage varies with the random switching frequency, so it can effectively spread power spectrum caused by HF current and pulsewidth modulation (PWM), which will effectively reduce the audible noise caused by the HF current and PWM. Additionally, the power spectral density of the HF current based on the proposed method is analyzed to verify the effectiveness in reducing audible noise. Then, a corresponding demodulation method for induced HF current is presented. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method has continuous spectra and the audible noises can be suppressed significantly.

<p>Deep learning methods for image quality assessment (IQA) are limited due to the small size of existing datasets. Extensive datasets require substantial resources both for generating publishable content and annotating it accurately. We present a systematic and scalable approach to creating KonIQ-10k, the largest IQA dataset to date, consisting of 10,073 quality scored images. It is the first in-the-wild database aiming for ecological validity, concerning the authenticity of distortions, the diversity of content, and quality-related indicators. Through the use of crowdsourcing, we obtained 1.2 million reliable quality ratings from 1,459 crowd workers, paving the way for more general IQA models. We propose a novel, deep learning model (KonCept512), to show an excellent generalization beyond the test set (0.921 SROCC), to the current state-of-the-art database LIVE-in-the-Wild (0.825 SROCC). The model derives its core performance from the InceptionResNet architecture, being trained at a higher resolution than previous models (512 &#x00d7; 384 ). Correlation analysis shows that KonCept512 performs similar to having 9 subjective scores for each test image.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>People constantly share their photographs with others through various social media sites. With the aid of the privacy settings provided by social media sites, image owners can designate scope of sharing, e.g., close friends and acquaintances. However, even if the owner of a photograph carefully sets the privacy setting to exclude a given individual who is not supposed to see the photograph, the photograph may still eventually reach a wider audience, including those clearly undesired through unanticipated channels of disclosure, causing a privacy breach. Moreover, it is often the case that a given image involves multiple stakeholders who are also depicted in the photograph. Due to various personalities, it is even more challenging to reach agreement on the privacy settings for these multi-owner photographs. In this paper, we propose a privacy risk reminder system, called REMIND, which estimates the probability that a shared photograph may be seen by unwanted people-through the social graph-who are not included in the original sharing list. We tackle this problem from a novel angle by digging into the big data regarding image sharing history. Specifically, the social media providers possess a huge amount of image sharing information (e.g., what photographs are shared with whom) of their users. By analyzing and modeling such rich information, we build a sophisticated probability model that efficiently aggregates the image disclosure probabilities along different possible image propagation chains and loops. If the computed disclosure probability indicates high risks of privacy breach, a reminder is issued to the image owner to help revise the privacy settings (or, at least, inform the user about this accidental disclosure risk). The proposed REMIND system also has a nice feature of policy harmonization that helps resolve privacy differences in multi-owner photographs. We have carried out a user study to validate the rationale of our proposed solutions and also conducte-
 experimental studies to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed REMIND system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The side-channel leakage is a consequence of program execution in a computer processor, and understanding relationship between code execution and information leakage is a necessary step in estimating information leakage and its capacity limits. This paper proposes a methodology to relate program execution to electromagnetic side-channel emanations and estimates side-channel information capacity created by execution of series of instructions (e.g., a function, a procedure, or a program) in a processor. To model dependence among program instructions in a code, we propose to use Markov source model, which includes the dependencies among sequence of instructions as well as dependencies among instructions as they pass through a pipeline of the processor. The emitted electromagnetic (EM) signals during instruction executions are natural choice for the inputs into the model. To obtain the channel inputs for the proposed model, we derive a mathematical relationship between the emanated instruction signal power (ESP) and total emanated signal power while running a program. Then, we derive the leakage capacity of EM side channels created by execution of series of instructions in a processor. Finally, we provide experimental results to demonstrate that leakages could be severe and that a dedicated attacker could obtain important information.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Online romance scams are a prevalent form of mass-marketing fraud in the West, and yet few studies have presented data-driven responses to this problem. In this type of scam, fraudsters craft fake profiles and manually interact with their victims. Because of the characteristics of this type of fraud and how dating sites operate, traditional detection methods (e.g., those used in spam filtering) are ineffective. In this paper, we investigate the archetype of online dating profiles used in this form of fraud, including their use of demographics, profile descriptions, and images, shedding light on both the strategies deployed by scammers to appeal to victims and the traits of victims themselves. Furthermore, in response to the severe financial and psychological harm caused by dating fraud, we develop a system to detect romance scammers on online dating platforms. This paper presents the first fully described system for automatically detecting this fraud. Our aim is to provide an early detection system to stop romance scammers as they create fraudulent profiles or before they engage with potential victims. Previous research has indicated that the victims of romance scams score highly on scales for idealized romantic beliefs. We combine a range of structured, unstructured, and deep-learned features that capture these beliefs in order to build a detection system. Our ensemble machine-learning approach is robust to the omission of profile details and performs at high accuracy (97%) in a hold-out validation set. The system enables development of automated tools for dating site providers and individual users.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We investigate the effect of outdated channel state information (CSI) on the secrecy performance of wireless-powered untrusted relay networks, in which the relay is a potential eavesdropper. To keep the information secret from this untrusted relay, the destination sends a jamming signal to the relay when the source transmits an information signal. At the same time, the relay harvests energy from the radio-frequency power, and forwards the received signals to the destination using this harvested energy. To determine the proportions of energy harvesting and information processing, the relay makes use of relaying based on power splitting or time switching policy. Although the destination tries to remove the jamming signal from the relaying signal, it cannot cancel out the jamming signal perfectly due to imperfect channel reciprocity caused by the outdated CSI; this residual jamming signal therefore has a negative impact on secrecy performance. In this scenario, we derive the closed-form expressions for the outage probability and average secrecy rate, and find the jamming power ratio, power splitting ratio, and time switching ratio to optimize these secrecy performance metrics. The numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of our analysis, and show that the proposed secure relaying protocols achieve a near-optimal secrecy performance, as well as outperforming the conventional scheme without the jamming power control.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Benefiting from the quick development of deep convolutional neural networks, especially fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), remarkable progresses have been achieved on salient object detection recently. Nevertheless, these FCNs based methods are still challenging to generate high resolution saliency maps, and also not applicable for subsequent applications due to their heavy model weights. In this paper, we propose a compact and efficient deep network with high accuracy for salient object detection. Firstly, we propose two strategies for initial prediction, one is a new designed multi-scale context module, the other is incorporating hand-crafted saliency priors. Secondly, we employ residual learning to refine it progressively by only learning the residual in each side-output, which can be achieved with few convolutional parameters, therefore leads to high compactness and high efficiency. Finally, we further design a novel top-down reverse attention block to guide the above side-output residual learning. Specifically, the current predicted salient regions are used to erase its side-output feature, thus the missing object parts and details can be efficiently learned from these unerased regions, which results in more complete detection and high accuracy. Extensive experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed network performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches, and shows advantages in simplicity, compactness and efficiency.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Seismic image interpolation is a currently popular research subject in modern reflection seismology. The interpolation problem is generally treated as a process of inversion. Under the compressed sensing framework, various sparse transformations and low-rank constraints based methods have great performances in recovering irregularly missing traces. However, in the case of regularly missing traces, their applications are limited because of the strong spatial aliasing energies. In addition, the erratic noise always poses a serious impact on the interpolation results obtained by the sparse transformations and low-rank constraints-based methods,. This is because the erratic noise is far from satisfying the statistical assumption behind these methods. In this study, we propose a mathematical morphology-based interpolation technique, which constrains the morphological scale of the model in the inversion process. The inversion problem is solved by the shaping regularization approach. The mathematical morphological constraint (MMC)-based interpolation technique has a satisfactory robustness to the spatial aliasing and erratic energies. We provide a detailed algorithmic framework and discuss the extension from 2D to higher dimensional version and the back operator in the shaping inversion. A group of numerical examples demonstrates the successful performance of the proposed technique.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The human visual system tends to consider saliency of an object as a whole. Some object-level saliency detection methods have been proposed by leveraging object proposals in bounding boxes, and regarding the entire bounding box as one candidate salient region. However, the bounding boxes can not provide exact object position and a lot of pixels in bounding boxes belong to the background. Consequently, background pixels in bounding box also show high saliency. Besides, acquiring object proposals needs high time cost. In order to compute object-level saliency, we consider region growing from some seed superpixels, to find one surrounding region which probably represents the whole object. The desired surrounding region has similar appearance inside and obvious difference with the outside, which is proposed as maximally stable region (MSR) in this paper. In addition, one effective seed superpixel selection strategy is presented to improve speed. MSR based saliency detection is more robust than pixel or superpixel level methods and object proposal based methods. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods at 50 FPS. Compared with deep learning based methods, we show worse performance, but with about 1200-1600 times faster, which means better trade-off between performance and speed.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we develop a concise but efficient network architecture called linear compressing based skip-connecting network (LCSCNet) for image super-resolution. Compared with two representative network architectures with skip connections, ResNet and DenseNet, a linear compressing layer is designed in LCSCNet for skip connection, which connects former feature maps and distinguishes them from newly-explored feature maps. In this way, the proposed LCSCNet enjoys the merits of the distinguish feature treatment of DenseNet and the parameter-economic form of ResNet. Moreover, to better exploit hierarchical information from both low and high levels of various receptive fields in deep models, inspired by gate units in LSTM, we also propose an adaptive element-wise fusion strategy with multi-supervised training. Experimental results in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms validate the effectiveness of LCSCNet.
