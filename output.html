<p>Caller ID parodying produces the valid Caller character, in this manner
deciding seem to start from another client. This apparently basic assault
strategy has been utilized in the developing communication fake and trick
calls, bringing about significant financial trouble. Unfortunately, callerID
spoofing is easy to implement but yet it is difficult to have protection
against it. In addition, there are not effective and defense solutions
available right now. In this research it is suggested the CIVE (Callee
Inference &amp; VErification), a compelling and viable guard against Caller ID
spoofing. This way it is described how it's possible to lunch call spoofing and
between line describe how CIVE approach method can help to prevent somehow this
kind of attacks. Caller ID Spoofing could cause huge financial and political
issues special nowadays, when many things even sometimes authentication and
verification are available by phone call, like banks approving transactions or
two factor authentications and many other things. We believe critical
industries specially banks and payment service providers should be protected
against such vulnerabilities with their system and make an approach to prevent
it, also it is very important to learn people specially who has special social
place like politicians or celebrities to know such kind of attack are already
exist. For this paper we implemented a call from white house to show there is
no limitation and no matter whom you try to spoof, but destination which is the
victim receive the call and that make this attack vector dangerous. And even
modern communication and even devices like 4G and smart phones are not able to
prevent or even detect this kind of attack. This study is a demonstration of
the vulnerabilities available. All experiments were conducted on isolated
mock-ups.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Motivated by the emerging needs of decentralized learners with personalized
learning objectives, we present an Assisted Learning framework where a service
provider Bob assists a learner Alice with supervised learning tasks without
transmitting Bob's private algorithm or data. Bob assists Alice either by
building a predictive model using Alice's labels, or by improving Alice's
private learning through iterative communications where only relevant
statistics are transmitted. The proposed learning framework is naturally
suitable for distributed, personalized, and privacy-aware scenarios. For
example, it is shown in some scenarios that two suboptimal learners could
achieve much better performance through Assisted Learning. Moreover, motivated
by privacy concerns in Assisted Learning, we present a new notion of privacy to
quantify the privacy leakage at learning level instead of data level. This new
privacy, named imitation privacy, is particularly suitable for a market of
statistical learners each holding private learning algorithms as well as data.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied to various applications
including image classification, text generation, audio recognition, and graph
data analysis. However, recent studies have shown that DNNs are vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. Though there are several works studying adversarial attack
and defense strategies on domains such as images and natural language
processing, it is still difficult to directly transfer the learned knowledge to
graph structure data due to its representation challenges. Given the importance
of graph analysis, an increasing number of works start to analyze the
robustness of machine learning models on graph data. Nevertheless, current
studies considering adversarial behaviors on graph data usually focus on
specific types of attacks with certain assumptions. In addition, each work
proposes its own mathematical formulation which makes the comparison among
different methods difficult. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to survey
existing adversarial learning strategies on graph data and first provide a
unified formulation for adversarial learning on graph data which covers most
adversarial learning studies on graph. Moreover, we also compare different
attacks and defenses on graph data and discuss their corresponding
contributions and limitations. In this work, we systemically organize the
considered works based on the features of each topic. This survey not only
serves as a reference for the research community, but also brings a clear image
researchers outside this research domain. Besides, we also create an online
resource and keep updating the relevant papers during the last two years. More
details of the comparisons of various studies based on this survey are
open-sourced at

<p>We demonstrate that the format in which private keys are persisted impacts
Side Channel Analysis (SCA) security. Surveying several widely deployed
software libraries, we investigate the formats they support, how they parse
these keys, and what runtime decisions they make. We uncover a combination of
weaknesses and vulnerabilities, in extreme cases inducing completely disjoint
multi-precision arithmetic stacks deep within the cryptosystem level for keys
that otherwise seem logically equivalent. Exploiting these vulnerabilities, we
design and implement key recovery attacks utilizing signals ranging from
electromagnetic (EM) emanations, to granular microarchitecture cache timings,
to coarse traditional wall clock timings.

<p>Machine learning based language models have recently made significant
progress, which introduces a danger to spread misinformation. To combat this
potential danger, several methods have been proposed for detecting text written
by these language models. This paper presents two classes of black-box attacks
on these detectors, one which randomly replaces characters with homoglyphs, and
the other a simple scheme to purposefully misspell words. The homoglyph and
misspelling attacks decrease a popular neural text detector's recall on neural
text from 97.44% to 0.26% and 22.68%, respectively. Results also indicate that
the attacks are transferable to other neural text detectors.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The problem of inefficient and unevenly distributed spectrum usage in industrial wireless networks has led to the emergence of the concept of industrial cognitive radio (CR) networks, which have particularly important applications in automotive industry. Industrial CR networks are planned to function in a wide spectrum range; therefore, they have high energy consumption because of frequency switching while other wireless technologies do not have this problem. A distinctive feature of this switching cost is that it depends on the wideness between the two frequency bands. In this article, we formulate the joint frequency assignment and scheduling problem for multihop industrial CR networks with a single transceiver by considering varying amounts of energy consumption that occurs while CR devices switch to different frequency bands. Our optimization problem, which we formulate as an integer linear program, minimizes the energy cost related to frequency switching while making frequency and time slot allocation to the cognitive devices. We prove that even on star graphs, our formulated problem is inapproximable within any polynomial-time computable function $f(n)$ in addition to being $textsc {NP}text {-Hard}$ in the strong sense. Therefore, we propose a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm to solve the energy consumption problem due to channel switching. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of our heuristic algorithm is very close to the results obtained from the integer linear programming implementation by CPLEX optimization software. We also compare our proposed method with the corresponding constant energy consumption for frequency switching case and two state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrate that taking into account the different energy consumption while switching to different frequency bands -

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Poor signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and low spatial resolutions have impeded low-cost pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensors from many intelligent applications for thermal target detection/recognition. This article presents a cognitive signal conditioning and modulation learning framework for PIR sensing with the following two innovations to solve these problems: 1) a reconfigurable signal conditioning circuit design to achieve high SNRs and 2) an optimal sensor mask design to achieve high recognition performance. By using a programmable system on chip, the PIR signal amplifier gain and filter bandwidth can be adjusted automatically according to working conditions. Based on the modeling between PIR physics and thermal images, sensor masks can be optimized through training convolution neural networks with large thermal image datasets for feature extraction of specific thermal targets. The experimental results verify the improved performance of PIR sensors in various working conditions and applications by using the developed reconfigurable circuit and application-specific masks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, we investigate code-oriented partitioning computation offloading strategy for multiple user equipments (UEs) and multiple mobile edge computing servers with limited resources (i.e., limited computing power and waiting task queues with finite capacity). This article aims to develop an offloading strategy to decide the execution location, CPU frequency, and transmission power for UE while minimizing the execution overhead (i.e., a weighted sum of energy consumption and computational time) of UE&#x0027;s applications, which is an NP-hard problem. To achieve the objective, first, we transform the problem into a convex optimization problem and find the optimal solution. Second, we propose a decentralized computation offloading strategy (DCOS) algorithm for UE, and define a dictionary data structure for recording the strategy of the UE to reduce the algorithm complexity. Finally, the effectiveness of DCOS, and the impact of various key parameters on the strategy and overhead are demonstrated by simulation experiments.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, we consider the security problem for the consensus-based distributed state estimation. To resist the malicious attacker who can falsify the data transmitted through the wireless channel, each node equips with an attack defender, which is based on the measurement of its built-in sensor. Under the stealthy attack, which can deceive the defender, we investigate the resilience and convergence of the distributed estimation in two different attack scenarios. For the attack with enough communication resources, we provide a sufficient condition of the optimal attack to quantify the maximum estimation performance degradation. We also analyze the resilience of the worst case distributed estimation caused by the attacker. For the attack with limited resources, the optimal Kalman gain for each node is derived to maximize its estimation performance under the attack. We also give a sufficient condition to guarantee the convergence of the distributed estimation in this case. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effect of the defender on guaranteeing the resilience of sensor networks against attacks.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This article presents a resilient robust model predictive control (RMPC) strategy for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with polytopic uncertainties and state saturation nonlinearities under the try-once-discard (TOD) scheduling. To reduce the transmission burden, a so-called TOD protocol is adopted to schedule the nodes. The objective of the addressed problem is to design a set of resilient RMPC controllers such that, in the simultaneous presence of polytopic uncertainties and state saturations under the TOD protocol, the resilience, robustness, and exponential stability are guaranteed for the underlying CPSs. With the help of TOD-dependent Lyapunov-like function, and the average dwell-time (ADT) approach, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the recursive feasibility of the proposed resilient RMPC approach and the exponential stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, two examples including a high-purity distillation process and a numerical simulation are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Digital power management systems allow power converters to operate with multiple changes in voltage reference. This asks for a new paradigm that shifts from achieving faster response to achieving best efficiency during multiple transients, with transient being eventually time constrained. State-space-based design of the control system fits perfectly this goal, since it is a time-domain design tool. It can further be enhanced with a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) optimization, configured with converter loss equation as cost function. The LQR mathematics guarantees a solution to the algebraic Riccati equation that produces the best system efficiency for the converter system during multiple transients. This article documents the design of the LQR control system having converter loss as a cost function and demonstrates the advantages of this method. The closed-loop control software yields very simple, running with a 250 kHz sampling frequency capability on a general use Microchip microcontroller platform. While a loss reduction of 2.5&#x0025; is demonstrated by experiment in our setup, the advantage depends on the actual system work profile.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, a hybrid interleaved connecting boost converter (HIBC) with a wide step-up regulation range is proposed, which is suitable for the low-voltage distributed generation applications. In the input of the HIBC, the primary windings of the double-coupled inductors are interleaved parallel connection, inheriting shared current and reduced current ripples. Then, the lossless passive clamped circuits are used to recycle the leakage energy of the coupled inductor and to reduce the voltage stress on the semiconductor devices to a very low level. The secondary windings of the coupled inductors are, respectively, combined with a capacitor&#x2013;diode to form the two voltage multiplier units, which are again, respectively, connected with an output capacitor for a voltage-doubling module. These two voltage-doubling modules are connected in interleaved series for supplying power to the output, whose structure enhances the voltage gain greatly without adopting an extreme duty cycle and reduces the output voltage ripples. In addition, the main switches of the proposed converter can be operated in zero-current switching and full duty cycle range in theory, achieving a wide step-up regulation range with the high efficiency. Finally, the theoretical behaviors of the presented converter are described in detail and some experimental results are also shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed converter.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This article focuses on the design of a magnetic sensor (MS) in position detection of a permanent magnet linear motor (PMLM). The MS is composed of a hall-effect-integrated-circuit and magnetic materials, and it is well known as a contactless sensor with a simple structure, and low cost. As a result, it is preferred for precise linear positioning applications. The work presented in this article consists of the following three steps to achieve high accuracy and economy in the mover position detection for a PMLM. First, the initial design of the MS is described which has been optimized using response surface methodology to obtain very low total harmonic distortion value of the sensing signal. Second, the leakage flux of PMLM is analytically investigated, from which it is determined that shielding the leakage flux is most appropriate to ensure the accuracy of the MS. Finally, in an attempt to reduce manufacturing cost, three MS prototypes using different materials (silicon steel laminated core, steel solid core, and ferrite solid core) are fabricated and tested. To verify the analytical results, several experiments are conducted. The experimental data prove that the accuracy of the MS is sufficient to use for mover position detection for the PMLM.

<p>Time delay of the finite control set model predictive current control caused by a large amount of calculations will degrade the control performance of the permanent magnet synchronous machine system. This letter first demonstrates the delay issue at length. Then, a new direct compensation method, by predicting the current variation within the delay time, is proposed. In comparison with the traditional two-step prediction strategy, the novel method is also easy to implement and can single out the best switching state in each period for optimal control.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A high-frequency (HF) voltage injection method can accurately estimate the rotor position of an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor at low speed. However, the fixed injection frequency for the traditional HF voltage injection method will produce a loud audible noise that limits the actual application of HF voltage injection method. In order to reduce the audible noise, a novel HF square-wave voltage injection method with the random switching frequency is proposed in this article. The frequency of the injected HF voltage varies with the random switching frequency, so it can effectively spread power spectrum caused by HF current and pulsewidth modulation (PWM), which will effectively reduce the audible noise caused by the HF current and PWM. Additionally, the power spectral density of the HF current based on the proposed method is analyzed to verify the effectiveness in reducing audible noise. Then, a corresponding demodulation method for induced HF current is presented. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method has continuous spectra and the audible noises can be suppressed significantly.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep learning methods for image quality assessment (IQA) are limited due to the small size of existing datasets. Extensive datasets require substantial resources both for generating publishable content and annotating it accurately. We present a systematic and scalable approach to creating KonIQ-10k, the largest IQA dataset to date, consisting of 10,073 quality scored images. It is the first in-the-wild database aiming for ecological validity, concerning the authenticity of distortions, the diversity of content, and quality-related indicators. Through the use of crowdsourcing, we obtained 1.2 million reliable quality ratings from 1,459 crowd workers, paving the way for more general IQA models. We propose a novel, deep learning model (KonCept512), to show an excellent generalization beyond the test set (0.921 SROCC), to the current state-of-the-art database LIVE-in-the-Wild (0.825 SROCC). The model derives its core performance from the InceptionResNet architecture, being trained at a higher resolution than previous models (512 &#x00d7; 384 ). Correlation analysis shows that KonCept512 performs similar to having 9 subjective scores for each test image.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>People constantly share their photographs with others through various social media sites. With the aid of the privacy settings provided by social media sites, image owners can designate scope of sharing, e.g., close friends and acquaintances. However, even if the owner of a photograph carefully sets the privacy setting to exclude a given individual who is not supposed to see the photograph, the photograph may still eventually reach a wider audience, including those clearly undesired through unanticipated channels of disclosure, causing a privacy breach. Moreover, it is often the case that a given image involves multiple stakeholders who are also depicted in the photograph. Due to various personalities, it is even more challenging to reach agreement on the privacy settings for these multi-owner photographs. In this paper, we propose a privacy risk reminder system, called REMIND, which estimates the probability that a shared photograph may be seen by unwanted people-through the social graph-who are not included in the original sharing list. We tackle this problem from a novel angle by digging into the big data regarding image sharing history. Specifically, the social media providers possess a huge amount of image sharing information (e.g., what photographs are shared with whom) of their users. By analyzing and modeling such rich information, we build a sophisticated probability model that efficiently aggregates the image disclosure probabilities along different possible image propagation chains and loops. If the computed disclosure probability indicates high risks of privacy breach, a reminder is issued to the image owner to help revise the privacy settings (or, at least, inform the user about this accidental disclosure risk). The proposed REMIND system also has a nice feature of policy harmonization that helps resolve privacy differences in multi-owner photographs. We have carried out a user study to validate the rationale of our proposed solutions and also conducte-
 experimental studies to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed REMIND system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The side-channel leakage is a consequence of program execution in a computer processor, and understanding relationship between code execution and information leakage is a necessary step in estimating information leakage and its capacity limits. This paper proposes a methodology to relate program execution to electromagnetic side-channel emanations and estimates side-channel information capacity created by execution of series of instructions (e.g., a function, a procedure, or a program) in a processor. To model dependence among program instructions in a code, we propose to use Markov source model, which includes the dependencies among sequence of instructions as well as dependencies among instructions as they pass through a pipeline of the processor. The emitted electromagnetic (EM) signals during instruction executions are natural choice for the inputs into the model. To obtain the channel inputs for the proposed model, we derive a mathematical relationship between the emanated instruction signal power (ESP) and total emanated signal power while running a program. Then, we derive the leakage capacity of EM side channels created by execution of series of instructions in a processor. Finally, we provide experimental results to demonstrate that leakages could be severe and that a dedicated attacker could obtain important information.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Online romance scams are a prevalent form of mass-marketing fraud in the West, and yet few studies have presented data-driven responses to this problem. In this type of scam, fraudsters craft fake profiles and manually interact with their victims. Because of the characteristics of this type of fraud and how dating sites operate, traditional detection methods (e.g., those used in spam filtering) are ineffective. In this paper, we investigate the archetype of online dating profiles used in this form of fraud, including their use of demographics, profile descriptions, and images, shedding light on both the strategies deployed by scammers to appeal to victims and the traits of victims themselves. Furthermore, in response to the severe financial and psychological harm caused by dating fraud, we develop a system to detect romance scammers on online dating platforms. This paper presents the first fully described system for automatically detecting this fraud. Our aim is to provide an early detection system to stop romance scammers as they create fraudulent profiles or before they engage with potential victims. Previous research has indicated that the victims of romance scams score highly on scales for idealized romantic beliefs. We combine a range of structured, unstructured, and deep-learned features that capture these beliefs in order to build a detection system. Our ensemble machine-learning approach is robust to the omission of profile details and performs at high accuracy (97%) in a hold-out validation set. The system enables development of automated tools for dating site providers and individual users.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We investigate the effect of outdated channel state information (CSI) on the secrecy performance of wireless-powered untrusted relay networks, in which the relay is a potential eavesdropper. To keep the information secret from this untrusted relay, the destination sends a jamming signal to the relay when the source transmits an information signal. At the same time, the relay harvests energy from the radio-frequency power, and forwards the received signals to the destination using this harvested energy. To determine the proportions of energy harvesting and information processing, the relay makes use of relaying based on power splitting or time switching policy. Although the destination tries to remove the jamming signal from the relaying signal, it cannot cancel out the jamming signal perfectly due to imperfect channel reciprocity caused by the outdated CSI; this residual jamming signal therefore has a negative impact on secrecy performance. In this scenario, we derive the closed-form expressions for the outage probability and average secrecy rate, and find the jamming power ratio, power splitting ratio, and time switching ratio to optimize these secrecy performance metrics. The numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of our analysis, and show that the proposed secure relaying protocols achieve a near-optimal secrecy performance, as well as outperforming the conventional scheme without the jamming power control.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In recent years there has been an increasing interest in sensing devices that capture multidimensional information such as the spectral light field (SLF) images, which are 5-dimensional (5D) representations of a scene including 2D spatial, 2D angular and 1D spectral information. Spatio-spectral and angular information plays an important role in modern applications spanning from microscopy to computer vision. However, SLF sensors use expensive beam-splitters or cameras arrays placed in tandem, which split the sensing problem in two time consuming and independent tasks: spectral and light field imaging tasks. This work proposes a compressive spectral light field imaging architecture that builds on the principles of the compressive imaging framework, to capture multiplexed representations of the multidimensional information, so that, less measurements are required to capture the SLF data cube. Alongside, we propose a computational algorithm to recover the 5D information from the compressed measurements, exploiting the inherent high correlations within the SLF by treating them as 3D tensors. Furthermore, exploiting the geometry properties of the proposed optical architecture, the Tucker decomposition is applied to the set of compressed measurements, so that, an ad-hoc dictionary-like image representation basis is calculated online. This in turn, entails a more accurate reconstruction of the SLF since the dictionary fits the specific characteristics of the image itself. We demonstrate through simulations over three SLF datasets captured in our laboratory, and an experimental proof-of-concept implementation, that the proposed compressive imaging device together with the proposed computational algorithm represent an efficient alternative to capture SLF, compared to conventional methods that employ either side-information or multiple sensors. Also, we show that the tensor-based proposed algorithm exhibits a lower computational complexity than the matrix-based state of the -
rt counterparts, thus enabling fast processing of multidimensional images.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Benefiting from the quick development of deep convolutional neural networks, especially fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), remarkable progresses have been achieved on salient object detection recently. Nevertheless, these FCNs based methods are still challenging to generate high resolution saliency maps, and also not applicable for subsequent applications due to their heavy model weights. In this paper, we propose a compact and efficient deep network with high accuracy for salient object detection. Firstly, we propose two strategies for initial prediction, one is a new designed multi-scale context module, the other is incorporating hand-crafted saliency priors. Secondly, we employ residual learning to refine it progressively by only learning the residual in each side-output, which can be achieved with few convolutional parameters, therefore leads to high compactness and high efficiency. Finally, we further design a novel top-down reverse attention block to guide the above side-output residual learning. Specifically, the current predicted salient regions are used to erase its side-output feature, thus the missing object parts and details can be efficiently learned from these unerased regions, which results in more complete detection and high accuracy. Extensive experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed network performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches, and shows advantages in simplicity, compactness and efficiency.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The human visual system tends to consider saliency of an object as a whole. Some object-level saliency detection methods have been proposed by leveraging object proposals in bounding boxes, and regarding the entire bounding box as one candidate salient region. However, the bounding boxes can not provide exact object position and a lot of pixels in bounding boxes belong to the background. Consequently, background pixels in bounding box also show high saliency. Besides, acquiring object proposals needs high time cost. In order to compute object-level saliency, we consider region growing from some seed superpixels, to find one surrounding region which probably represents the whole object. The desired surrounding region has similar appearance inside and obvious difference with the outside, which is proposed as maximally stable region (MSR) in this paper. In addition, one effective seed superpixel selection strategy is presented to improve speed. MSR based saliency detection is more robust than pixel or superpixel level methods and object proposal based methods. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods at 50 FPS. Compared with deep learning based methods, we show worse performance, but with about 1200-1600 times faster, which means better trade-off between performance and speed.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we develop a concise but efficient network architecture called linear compressing based skip-connecting network (LCSCNet) for image super-resolution. Compared with two representative network architectures with skip connections, ResNet and DenseNet, a linear compressing layer is designed in LCSCNet for skip connection, which connects former feature maps and distinguishes them from newly-explored feature maps. In this way, the proposed LCSCNet enjoys the merits of the distinguish feature treatment of DenseNet and the parameter-economic form of ResNet. Moreover, to better exploit hierarchical information from both low and high levels of various receptive fields in deep models, inspired by gate units in LSTM, we also propose an adaptive element-wise fusion strategy with multi-supervised training. Experimental results in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms validate the effectiveness of LCSCNet.
