<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Contact tracing is being widely employed to combat the spread of COVID-19.
Many apps have been developed that allow for tracing to be done automatically
based off location and interaction data generated by users. There are concerns,
however, regarding the privacy and security of users data when using these
apps. These concerns are paramount for users who contract the virus, as they
are generally required to release all their data. Motivated by the need to
protect users privacy we propose two solutions to this problem. Our first
solution builds on current "message based" methods and our second leverages
ideas from secret sharing and additively homomorphic encryption.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Function inversion is the problem that given a random function $f: [M] \to
[N]$, we want to find pre-image of any image $f^{-1}(y)$ in time $T$. In this
work, we revisit this problem under the preprocessing model where we can
compute some auxiliary information or advice of size $S$ that only depends on
$f$ but not on $y$. It is a well-studied problem in the classical settings,
however, it is not clear how quantum algorithms can solve this task any better
besides invoking Grover's algorithm, which does not leverage the power of
preprocessing.
</p>
<p>Nayebi et al. proved a lower bound $ST^2 \ge \tilde\Omega(N)$ for quantum
algorithms inverting permutations, however, they only consider algorithms with
classical advice. Hhan et al. subsequently extended this lower bound to fully
quantum algorithms for inverting permutations. In this work, we give the same
asymptotic lower bound to fully quantum algorithms for inverting functions for
fully quantum algorithms under the regime where $M = O(N)$.
</p>
<p>In order to prove these bounds, we generalize the notion of quantum random
access code, originally introduced by Ambainis et al., to the setting where we
are given a list of (not necessarily independent) random variables, and we wish
to compress them into a variable-length encoding such that we can retrieve a
random element just using the encoding with high probability. As our main
technical contribution, we give a nearly tight lower bound (for a wide
parameter range) for this generalized notion of quantum random access codes,
which may be of independent interest.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Governments and researchers around the world are implementing digital contact
tracing solutions to stem the spread of infectious disease, namely COVID-19.
Many of these solutions threaten individual rights and privacy. Our goal is to
break past the false dichotomy of effective versus privacy-preserving contact
tracing. We offer an alternative approach to assess and communicate users' risk
of exposure to an infectious disease while preserving individual privacy. Our
proposal uses recent GPS location histories, which are transformed and
encrypted, and a private set intersection protocol to interface with a
semi-trusted authority.
</p>
<p>There have been other recent proposals for privacy-preserving contact
tracing, based on Bluetooth and decentralization, that could further eliminate
the need for trust in authority. However, solutions with Bluetooth are
currently limited to certain devices and contexts while decentralization adds
complexity. The goal of this work is two-fold: we aim to propose a
location-based system that is more privacy-preserving than what is currently
being adopted by governments around the world, and that is also practical to
implement with the immediacy needed to stem a viral outbreak.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We study the security of large-scale cyber-physical systems (CPS) consisting
of multiple interdependent subsystems, each managed by a different defender.
Defenders invest their security budgets with the goal of thwarting the spread
of cyber attacks to their critical assets. We model the security investment
decisions made by the defenders as a security game. While prior work has used
security games to analyze such scenarios, we propose behavioral security games,
in which defenders exhibit characteristics of human decision making that have
been identified in behavioral economics as representing typical human cognitive
biases. This is important as many of the critical security decisions in our
target class of systems are made by humans.
</p>
<p>We provide empirical evidence for our behavioral model through a controlled
subject experiment. We then show that behavioral decision making leads to a
suboptimal pattern of resource allocation compared to non-behavioral decision
making. We illustrate the effects of behavioral decision making using two
representative real-world interdependent CPS. In particular, we identify the
effects of the defenders' security budget availability and distribution, the
degree of interdependency among defenders, and collaborative defense
strategies, on the degree of suboptimality of security outcomes due to
behavioral decision making. In this context, the adverse effects of behavioral
decision making are most severe with moderate defense budgets. Moreover, the
impact of behavioral suboptimal decision making is magnified as the degree of
the interdependency between subnetworks belonging to different defenders
increases. We also observe that selfish defense decisions together with
behavioral decisions significantly increase security risk.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper reports a novel approach that uses transistor aging in an
integrated circuit (IC) to detect hardware Trojans. When one reduces the supply
voltage of a transistor from an initial higher voltage to a smaller voltage, it
causes short term aging in the transistor. When stressing the transistor, the
higher supply voltage produces a larger aging-induced threshold voltage.
Transition of the supply voltage to a smaller value at this higher threshold
voltage reduces the transistor current. This ends up in a longer switching
delay through the transistor than what standalone voltage scaling causes. This
increase in delay results in timing violations that reveal as timing errors at
the output of the IC during its operation. We present experiments using
aging-aware standard cell libraries to illustrate the usefulness of the
technique in detecting hardware Trojans. Combining IC aging with over-clocking
produces a pattern of bit errors at the IC output by the induced timing
violations. We use machine learning to learn the bit error distribution at the
output of a clean IC. We differentiate the divergence in the pattern of bit
errors because of a Trojan in the IC from this baseline distribution. We
simulate the golden IC and show robustness to IC-to-IC manufacturing
variations. The approach is effective and can detect a Trojan even if we plant
it far off the critical paths. Simulation results on benchmarks from the
Trust-hub show a Trojan detection accuracy of over 99%.

<p>New study from researchers in Finland and the United Kingdom reveals that tumors lacking a protein called BAP1 have an ineffective immune reaction against cancer, thus rendering immunotherapies ineffectual, particularly in uveal melanomas (UM). The researchers also discovered that when BAP1 is lost, other molecules will be present in order to support cancer growth. Luckily, some of these molecules can be targeted with existing drugs, which can lead to the development of novel immunotherapies.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy is associated with higher risks of pregnancy complications, including preterm birth, whether or not symptoms are reported. Bacterial vaginosis is currently considered to be a microbial imbalance of the lower genital tract characterized by low levels of &#8220;healthy&#8221; Lactobacillus and overgrowth of a mixed population of other bacterial genera, including Gardnerella, Atopobium, Prevotella, Mobiluncus, Sneathia, and other taxa. Many of these microbes are also common isolates from sites of intrauterine infection, including the placenta and amniotic fluid. These findings have motivated investigators to conduct clinical trials to examine the potential benefits and harms associated with screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women, either applied to a general obstetric population or targeting women at increased risk for preterm delivery, such as those with prior preterm birth. This is particularly important in light of growing concerns about the effects of antibiotic use on long-term maternal and child health because of effects on their microbiomes.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The problem of inefficient and unevenly distributed spectrum usage in industrial wireless networks has led to the emergence of the concept of industrial cognitive radio (CR) networks, which have particularly important applications in automotive industry. Industrial CR networks are planned to function in a wide spectrum range; therefore, they have high energy consumption because of frequency switching while other wireless technologies do not have this problem. A distinctive feature of this switching cost is that it depends on the wideness between the two frequency bands. In this article, we formulate the joint frequency assignment and scheduling problem for multihop industrial CR networks with a single transceiver by considering varying amounts of energy consumption that occurs while CR devices switch to different frequency bands. Our optimization problem, which we formulate as an integer linear program, minimizes the energy cost related to frequency switching while making frequency and time slot allocation to the cognitive devices. We prove that even on star graphs, our formulated problem is inapproximable within any polynomial-time computable function $f(n)$ in addition to being $textsc {NP}text {-Hard}$ in the strong sense. Therefore, we propose a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm to solve the energy consumption problem due to channel switching. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of our heuristic algorithm is very close to the results obtained from the integer linear programming implementation by CPLEX optimization software. We also compare our proposed method with the corresponding constant energy consumption for frequency switching case and two state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrate that taking into account the different energy consumption while switching to different frequency bands -
s vital for joint frequency assignment and scheduling in multihop industrial CR networks with a single transceiver.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Poor signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and low spatial resolutions have impeded low-cost pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensors from many intelligent applications for thermal target detection/recognition. This article presents a cognitive signal conditioning and modulation learning framework for PIR sensing with the following two innovations to solve these problems: 1) a reconfigurable signal conditioning circuit design to achieve high SNRs and 2) an optimal sensor mask design to achieve high recognition performance. By using a programmable system on chip, the PIR signal amplifier gain and filter bandwidth can be adjusted automatically according to working conditions. Based on the modeling between PIR physics and thermal images, sensor masks can be optimized through training convolution neural networks with large thermal image datasets for feature extraction of specific thermal targets. The experimental results verify the improved performance of PIR sensors in various working conditions and applications by using the developed reconfigurable circuit and application-specific masks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, we investigate code-oriented partitioning computation offloading strategy for multiple user equipments (UEs) and multiple mobile edge computing servers with limited resources (i.e., limited computing power and waiting task queues with finite capacity). This article aims to develop an offloading strategy to decide the execution location, CPU frequency, and transmission power for UE while minimizing the execution overhead (i.e., a weighted sum of energy consumption and computational time) of UE&#x0027;s applications, which is an NP-hard problem. To achieve the objective, first, we transform the problem into a convex optimization problem and find the optimal solution. Second, we propose a decentralized computation offloading strategy (DCOS) algorithm for UE, and define a dictionary data structure for recording the strategy of the UE to reduce the algorithm complexity. Finally, the effectiveness of DCOS, and the impact of various key parameters on the strategy and overhead are demonstrated by simulation experiments.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, we consider the security problem for the consensus-based distributed state estimation. To resist the malicious attacker who can falsify the data transmitted through the wireless channel, each node equips with an attack defender, which is based on the measurement of its built-in sensor. Under the stealthy attack, which can deceive the defender, we investigate the resilience and convergence of the distributed estimation in two different attack scenarios. For the attack with enough communication resources, we provide a sufficient condition of the optimal attack to quantify the maximum estimation performance degradation. We also analyze the resilience of the worst case distributed estimation caused by the attacker. For the attack with limited resources, the optimal Kalman gain for each node is derived to maximize its estimation performance under the attack. We also give a sufficient condition to guarantee the convergence of the distributed estimation in this case. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effect of the defender on guaranteeing the resilience of sensor networks against attacks.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This article presents a resilient robust model predictive control (RMPC) strategy for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with polytopic uncertainties and state saturation nonlinearities under the try-once-discard (TOD) scheduling. To reduce the transmission burden, a so-called TOD protocol is adopted to schedule the nodes. The objective of the addressed problem is to design a set of resilient RMPC controllers such that, in the simultaneous presence of polytopic uncertainties and state saturations under the TOD protocol, the resilience, robustness, and exponential stability are guaranteed for the underlying CPSs. With the help of TOD-dependent Lyapunov-like function, and the average dwell-time (ADT) approach, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the recursive feasibility of the proposed resilient RMPC approach and the exponential stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, two examples including a high-purity distillation process and a numerical simulation are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Digital power management systems allow power converters to operate with multiple changes in voltage reference. This asks for a new paradigm that shifts from achieving faster response to achieving best efficiency during multiple transients, with transient being eventually time constrained. State-space-based design of the control system fits perfectly this goal, since it is a time-domain design tool. It can further be enhanced with a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) optimization, configured with converter loss equation as cost function. The LQR mathematics guarantees a solution to the algebraic Riccati equation that produces the best system efficiency for the converter system during multiple transients. This article documents the design of the LQR control system having converter loss as a cost function and demonstrates the advantages of this method. The closed-loop control software yields very simple, running with a 250 kHz sampling frequency capability on a general use Microchip microcontroller platform. While a loss reduction of 2.5&#x0025; is demonstrated by experiment in our setup, the advantage depends on the actual system work profile.

<p>This article focuses on the design of a magnetic sensor (MS) in position detection of a permanent magnet linear motor (PMLM). The MS is composed of a hall-effect-integrated-circuit and magnetic materials, and it is well known as a contactless sensor with a simple structure, and low cost. As a result, it is preferred for precise linear positioning applications. The work presented in this article consists of the following three steps to achieve high accuracy and economy in the mover position detection for a PMLM. First, the initial design of the MS is described which has been optimized using response surface methodology to obtain very low total harmonic distortion value of the sensing signal. Second, the leakage flux of PMLM is analytically investigated, from which it is determined that shielding the leakage flux is most appropriate to ensure the accuracy of the MS. Finally, in an attempt to reduce manufacturing cost, three MS prototypes using different materials (silicon steel laminated core, steel solid core, and ferrite solid core) are fabricated and tested. To verify the analytical results, several experiments are conducted. The experimental data prove that the accuracy of the MS is sufficient to use for mover position detection for the PMLM.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Time delay of the finite control set model predictive current control caused by a large amount of calculations will degrade the control performance of the permanent magnet synchronous machine system. This letter first demonstrates the delay issue at length. Then, a new direct compensation method, by predicting the current variation within the delay time, is proposed. In comparison with the traditional two-step prediction strategy, the novel method is also easy to implement and can single out the best switching state in each period for optimal control. Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A high-frequency (HF) voltage injection method can accurately estimate the rotor position of an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor at low speed. However, the fixed injection frequency for the traditional HF voltage injection method will produce a loud audible noise that limits the actual application of HF voltage injection method. In order to reduce the audible noise, a novel HF square-wave voltage injection method with the random switching frequency is proposed in this article. The frequency of the injected HF voltage varies with the random switching frequency, so it can effectively spread power spectrum caused by HF current and pulsewidth modulation (PWM), which will effectively reduce the audible noise caused by the HF current and PWM. Additionally, the power spectral density of the HF current based on the proposed method is analyzed to verify the effectiveness in reducing audible noise. Then, a corresponding demodulation method for induced HF current is presented. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method has continuous spectra and the audible noises can be suppressed significantly.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep learning methods for image quality assessment (IQA) are limited due to the small size of existing datasets. Extensive datasets require substantial resources both for generating publishable content and annotating it accurately. We present a systematic and scalable approach to creating KonIQ-10k, the largest IQA dataset to date, consisting of 10,073 quality scored images. It is the first in-the-wild database aiming for ecological validity, concerning the authenticity of distortions, the diversity of content, and quality-related indicators. Through the use of crowdsourcing, we obtained 1.2 million reliable quality ratings from 1,459 crowd workers, paving the way for more general IQA models. We propose a novel, deep learning model (KonCept512), to show an excellent generalization beyond the test set (0.921 SROCC), to the current state-of-the-art database LIVE-in-the-Wild (0.825 SROCC). The model derives its core performance from the InceptionResNet architecture, being trained at a higher resolution than previous models (512 &#x00d7; 384 ). Correlation analysis shows that KonCept512 performs similar to having 9 subjective scores for each test image.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>People constantly share their photographs with others through various social media sites. With the aid of the privacy settings provided by social media sites, image owners can designate scope of sharing, e.g., close friends and acquaintances. However, even if the owner of a photograph carefully sets the privacy setting to exclude a given individual who is not supposed to see the photograph, the photograph may still eventually reach a wider audience, including those clearly undesired through unanticipated channels of disclosure, causing a privacy breach. Moreover, it is often the case that a given image involves multiple stakeholders who are also depicted in the photograph. Due to various personalities, it is even more challenging to reach agreement on the privacy settings for these multi-owner photographs. In this paper, we propose a privacy risk reminder system, called REMIND, which estimates the probability that a shared photograph may be seen by unwanted people-through the social graph-who are not included in the original sharing list. We tackle this problem from a novel angle by digging into the big data regarding image sharing history. Specifically, the social media providers possess a huge amount of image sharing information (e.g., what photographs are shared with whom) of their users. By analyzing and modeling such rich information, we build a sophisticated probability model that efficiently aggregates the image disclosure probabilities along different possible image propagation chains and loops. If the computed disclosure probability indicates high risks of privacy breach, a reminder is issued to the image owner to help revise the privacy settings (or, at least, inform the user about this accidental disclosure risk). The proposed REMIND system also has a nice feature of policy harmonization that helps resolve privacy differences in multi-owner photographs. We have carried out a user study to validate the rationale of our proposed solutions and also conducte-
 experimental studies to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed REMIND system.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The side-channel leakage is a consequence of program execution in a computer processor, and understanding relationship between code execution and information leakage is a necessary step in estimating information leakage and its capacity limits. This paper proposes a methodology to relate program execution to electromagnetic side-channel emanations and estimates side-channel information capacity created by execution of series of instructions (e.g., a function, a procedure, or a program) in a processor. To model dependence among program instructions in a code, we propose to use Markov source model, which includes the dependencies among sequence of instructions as well as dependencies among instructions as they pass through a pipeline of the processor. The emitted electromagnetic (EM) signals during instruction executions are natural choice for the inputs into the model. To obtain the channel inputs for the proposed model, we derive a mathematical relationship between the emanated instruction signal power (ESP) and total emanated signal power while running a program. Then, we derive the leakage capacity of EM side channels created by execution of series of instructions in a processor. Finally, we provide experimental results to demonstrate that leakages could be severe and that a dedicated attacker could obtain important information.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

<p>Online romance scams are a prevalent form of mass-marketing fraud in the West, and yet few studies have presented data-driven responses to this problem. In this type of scam, fraudsters craft fake profiles and manually interact with their victims. Because of the characteristics of this type of fraud and how dating sites operate, traditional detection methods (e.g., those used in spam filtering) are ineffective. In this paper, we investigate the archetype of online dating profiles used in this form of fraud, including their use of demographics, profile descriptions, and images, shedding light on both the strategies deployed by scammers to appeal to victims and the traits of victims themselves. Furthermore, in response to the severe financial and psychological harm caused by dating fraud, we develop a system to detect romance scammers on online dating platforms. This paper presents the first fully described system for automatically detecting this fraud. Our aim is to provide an early detection system to stop romance scammers as they create fraudulent profiles or before they engage with potential victims. Previous research has indicated that the victims of romance scams score highly on scales for idealized romantic beliefs. We combine a range of structured, unstructured, and deep-learned features that capture these beliefs in order to build a detection system. Our ensemble machine-learning approach is robust to the omission of profile details and performs at high accuracy (97%) in a hold-out validation set. The system enables development of automated tools for dating site providers and individual users.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We investigate the effect of outdated channel state information (CSI) on the secrecy performance of wireless-powered untrusted relay networks, in which the relay is a potential eavesdropper. To keep the information secret from this untrusted relay, the destination sends a jamming signal to the relay when the source transmits an information signal. At the same time, the relay harvests energy from the radio-frequency power, and forwards the received signals to the destination using this harvested energy. To determine the proportions of energy harvesting and information processing, the relay makes use of relaying based on power splitting or time switching policy. Although the destination tries to remove the jamming signal from the relaying signal, it cannot cancel out the jamming signal perfectly due to imperfect channel reciprocity caused by the outdated CSI; this residual jamming signal therefore has a negative impact on secrecy performance. In this scenario, we derive the closed-form expressions for the outage probability and average secrecy rate, and find the jamming power ratio, power splitting ratio, and time switching ratio to optimize these secrecy performance metrics. The numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of our analysis, and show that the proposed secure relaying protocols achieve a near-optimal secrecy performance, as well as outperforming the conventional scheme without the jamming power control.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Benefiting from the quick development of deep convolutional neural networks, especially fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), remarkable progresses have been achieved on salient object detection recently. Nevertheless, these FCNs based methods are still challenging to generate high resolution saliency maps, and also not applicable for subsequent applications due to their heavy model weights. In this paper, we propose a compact and efficient deep network with high accuracy for salient object detection. Firstly, we propose two strategies for initial prediction, one is a new designed multi-scale context module, the other is incorporating hand-crafted saliency priors. Secondly, we employ residual learning to refine it progressively by only learning the residual in each side-output, which can be achieved with few convolutional parameters, therefore leads to high compactness and high efficiency. Finally, we further design a novel top-down reverse attention block to guide the above side-output residual learning. Specifically, the current predicted salient regions are used to erase its side-output feature, thus the missing object parts and details can be efficiently learned from these unerased regions, which results in more complete detection and high accuracy. Extensive experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed network performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches, and shows advantages in simplicity, compactness and efficiency.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Seismic image interpolation is a currently popular research subject in modern reflection seismology. The interpolation problem is generally treated as a process of inversion. Under the compressed sensing framework, various sparse transformations and low-rank constraints based methods have great performances in recovering irregularly missing traces. However, in the case of regularly missing traces, their applications are limited because of the strong spatial aliasing energies. In addition, the erratic noise always poses a serious impact on the interpolation results obtained by the sparse transformations and low-rank constraints-based methods,. This is because the erratic noise is far from satisfying the statistical assumption behind these methods. In this study, we propose a mathematical morphology-based interpolation technique, which constrains the morphological scale of the model in the inversion process. The inversion problem is solved by the shaping regularization approach. The mathematical morphological constraint (MMC)-based interpolation technique has a satisfactory robustness to the spatial aliasing and erratic energies. We provide a detailed algorithmic framework and discuss the extension from 2D to higher dimensional version and the back operator in the shaping inversion. A group of numerical examples demonstrates the successful performance of the proposed technique.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The human visual system tends to consider saliency of an object as a whole. Some object-level saliency detection methods have been proposed by leveraging object proposals in bounding boxes, and regarding the entire bounding box as one candidate salient region. However, the bounding boxes can not provide exact object position and a lot of pixels in bounding boxes belong to the background. Consequently, background pixels in bounding box also show high saliency. Besides, acquiring object proposals needs high time cost. In order to compute object-level saliency, we consider region growing from some seed superpixels, to find one surrounding region which probably represents the whole object. The desired surrounding region has similar appearance inside and obvious difference with the outside, which is proposed as maximally stable region (MSR) in this paper. In addition, one effective seed superpixel selection strategy is presented to improve speed. MSR based saliency detection is more robust than pixel or superpixel level methods and object proposal based methods. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods at 50 FPS. Compared with deep learning based methods, we show worse performance, but with about 1200-1600 times faster, which means better trade-off between performance and speed.

<p>In this paper, we develop a concise but efficient network architecture called linear compressing based skip-connecting network (LCSCNet) for image super-resolution. Compared with two representative network architectures with skip connections, ResNet and DenseNet, a linear compressing layer is designed in LCSCNet for skip connection, which connects former feature maps and distinguishes them from newly-explored feature maps. In this way, the proposed LCSCNet enjoys the merits of the distinguish feature treatment of DenseNet and the parameter-economic form of ResNet. Moreover, to better exploit hierarchical information from both low and high levels of various receptive fields in deep models, inspired by gate units in LSTM, we also propose an adaptive element-wise fusion strategy with multi-supervised training. Experimental results in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms validate the effectiveness of LCSCNet.
