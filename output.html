<p>Many of Sierra Leone's former child soldiers have gradually earned greater acceptance from families and communities, according to a sweeping new study of their adult lives. Former child soldiers experience mental health problems as a result of their experiences, but acceptance by family and community are central to their reintegration into society, according to the study in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We analyze a two-receiver binary-input discrete memoryless broadcast channel, in which the transmitter communicates a common message simultaneously to both receivers and a covert message to only one of them. The unintended recipient of the covert message is treated as an adversary who attempts to detect the covert transmission. This model captures the problem of embedding covert messages in an innocent codebook and generalizes previous covert communication models in which innocent behavior corresponds to the absence of communication between legitimate users. We identify the exact asymptotic behavior of the number of covert bits that can be transmitted when the rate of the innocent codebook is close to the capacity of the channel to the adversary. Our results also identify the dependence of the number of covert bits on the channel parameters and the characteristics of the innocent codebook.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>About 56 million abortions are done annually, and almost half (25 million) are unsafe, of which 97% occur in developing countries. An estimated 8% of all maternal deaths are due to abortion, leaving a massive unmet global need for access to safe abortion services. Despite this situation, the USA, the world's largest global health donor, takes a hardline stance against abortion both at home and abroad. On June 5, the International Women's Health Coalition launched Crisis in care: year two impact of Trump's global gag rule, detailing the direct effect of anti-abortion policies and the broader ways in which they are threatening the work of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that support women and vulnerable groups around the world.

The Lancet's 2019 theme issue on advancing women in science, medicine, and global health and now its new Series on gender equality, norms, and health1&#8211;5 provide updated evidence on the pervasiveness of gender inequities, unequal power dynamics, and other intersecting factors within society that often leave women disempowered, disenfranchised, and vulnerable. In their Series paper, Geeta Rao Gupta and colleagues5 remind us that the barriers to progress are primarily political, which gives the UN a distinct role to advocate for political commitment, ensure accountability to international instruments, and enable gender transformative implementation with the right tools, resources, and evidence.

<p>&#8220;A deafening silence&#8221; is how Sarah Hawkes, Director of the Centre for Gender and Global Health at University College London (UCL), UK, recalls the reaction to a 2013 Lancet Viewpoint on gender and global health that she wrote with her husband Kent Buse. Its inclusive gender-based approach &#8220;was deemed politically unacceptable at the time, as most gender-based discussions in global health had hitherto focused on maternal health, in the context of sexual health and HIV&#8221;, she says. The agenda has now changed and a new Lancet Series examines gender equality, norms, and health.

<p>Sparse coding-based anomaly detection has shown promising performance, of which the keys are feature learning, sparse representation, and dictionary learning. In this paper, we propose a new neural network for anomaly detection (termed AnomalyNet) by deeply achieving feature learning, sparse representation, and dictionary learning in three joint neural processing blocks. Specifically, to learn better features, we design a motion fusion block accompanied by a feature transfer block to enjoy the advantages of eliminating noisy background, capturing motion, and alleviating data deficiency. Furthermore, to address some disadvantages (e.g., nonadaptive updating) of the existing sparse coding optimizers and embrace the merits of neural network (e.g., parallel computing), we design a novel recurrent neural network to learn sparse representation and dictionary by proposing an adaptive iterative hard-thresholding algorithm (adaptive ISTA) and reformulating the adaptive ISTA as a new long short-term memory (LSTM). To the best of our knowledge, this could be one of the first works to bridge the  $ell _{1}$ -solver and LSTM and may provide novel insight into understanding LSTM and model-based optimization (or named differentiable programming), as well as sparse coding-based anomaly detection. Extensive experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of our method in the abnormal events detection task.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Gait is a useful biometric feature for human identification in video surveillance applications since it can be obtained without subject cooperation. In recent years, model-based gait recognition using a 3D skeleton has been widely studied through view-invariant modeling and kinematic gait analysis. However, existing methods integrate all frame-level feature vectors using the same criterion, even though skeleton information is highly sensitive to changes in covariate conditions such as clothing, carrying, and occlusion. The scheme inevitably reduces the frame-level discriminative power and eventually degrades performance. Instead, we propose a robust frame-level matching method for gait recognition that minimizes the influence of noisy patterns as well as secures the frame-level discriminative power. To this end, we measure the skeleton quality in terms of body symmetry for each frame. Based on the quality, we construct a quality-adjusted cost matrix between input frames and registered frames to prevent matching with noisy patterns. Our two-stage linear matching is then applied to the cost matrix to compute a frame-level discriminative score including similarity and margin. In the end, the identity of a probe is determined by a weighted majority voting scheme via frame-level scores. It enhances the robustness against inaccurate skeleton estimation results by assigning different weights for each frame based on the score. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets (UPCVgait, UPCVgaitK2, and SDUgait) and a new gait dataset which we create with consideration of unpredictable behaviors while walking. In addition, we demonstrate that our method is robust to skeleton estimation error, partial occlusion, and data loss. The CILgait dataset and MATLAB code are available at https://sites.google.com/site/seokeonchoi/gait-recognition.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, a frequency diverse array-based directional modulation with artificial noise synthesis scheme is proposed to enhance the physical layer security of wireless communications. We aim to optimize the secrecy performance by jointly optimizing the frequency offsets, the beamforming vector, and the artificial-noise projection matrix (ANPM). Specifically, we address the physical layer security problems for known locations of proximal eavesdropper (Eve) and legitimate user (LU). The beamforming vector and frequency offsets are designed to preserve the signal power at LU. The ANPM is calculated to minimize the effect of AN on LU. Furthermore, we extend our approach to the case of multi-LUs with unknown Eve locations. Being different from the case of a single LU, the frequency offsets across array antennas are optimized to equally allocate transmitted power to each LU. The numerical results show that the proposed method can provide a higher secrecy performance than conventional DM methods. In the case of multi-LUs with unknown Eve locations, the proposed method can provide a high secrecy capacity while achieving almost equal achievable capacity to each LU.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper considers physical layer security enhancement mechanisms that utilize simultaneous beamforming and jamming in visible light communication systems with a randomly located eavesdropper under the assumption that there are multiple light-emitting diode (LED) transmitters and one intended user. When an eavesdropper with an augmented front-end receiver is present, the jamming is very useful for preventing the eavesdropper from wiretapping the information since it is not possible to extract only the information component from the received signal if the jamming signal is random. Thus, in this paper, an optimization problem is formulated with a focus on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio for the legitimate link, and it is solved by a heuristic method called the concave&#x2013;convex procedure. Then, a ternary scheme is proposed, which is less complicated than the full (joint) scheme, and it is optimized by adopting a formulation based on an assignment problem, the solution of which is effectively obtained by the so-called tabu search procedure. In addition, the problem of maximizing the average secrecy rate is investigated by utilizing a continuous LED model, which significantly relaxes the complication that rises from calculating the expectation with respect to the location of the eavesdropper. Our analysis and simulation results show that the proposed simultaneous beamforming and jamming strategies (both joint and ternary) are good proxies for maximizing the average secrecy rate by utilizing the statistical information on the eavesdropper&#x2019;s random location.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deblurring is a fundamental inverse problem in bioimaging. It requires modeling the point spread function (PSF), which captures the optical distortions entailed by the image formation process. The PSF limits the spatial resolution attainable for a given microscope. However, recent applications require a higher resolution and have prompted the development of super-resolution techniques to achieve sub-pixel accuracy. This requirement restricts the class of suitable PSF models to analog ones. In addition, deblurring is computationally intensive, hence further requiring computationally efficient models. A custom candidate fitting both the requirements is the Gaussian model. However, this model cannot capture the rich tail structures found in both the theoretical and empirical PSFs. In this paper, we aim at improving the reconstruction accuracy beyond the Gaussian model, while preserving its computational efficiency. We introduce a new class of analog PSF models based on the Gaussian mixtures. The number of Gaussian kernels controls both the modeling accuracy and the computational efficiency of the model: the lower the number of kernels, the lower the accuracy and the higher the efficiency. To explore the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, we propose a variational formulation of the PSF calibration problem, where a convex sparsity-inducing penalty on the number of Gaussian kernels allows trading accuracy for efficiency. We derive an efficient algorithm based on a fully split formulation of alternating split Bregman. We assess our framework on synthetic and real data, and demonstrate a better reconstruction accuracy in both geometry and photometry in point source localization&#x2014;a fundamental inverse problem in fluorescence microscopy.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a new algorithm for automatic estimation of muscle fiber orientation (MFO) in musculoskeletal ultrasound images, which is commonly used for both diagnosis and rehabilitation assessment of patients. The algorithm is based on a novel adaptive fading Bayesian Kalman filter (AF-BKF) and an automatic region of interest (ROI) extraction method. The ROI is first enhanced by the Gabor filter (GF) and extracted automatically using the revoting constrained Radon transform (RCRT) approach. The dominant MFO in the ROI is then detected by the RT and tracked by the proposed AF-BKF, which employs simplified Gaussian mixtures to approximate the non-Gaussian state densities and a new adaptive fading method to update the mixture parameters. An AF-BK smoother (AF-BKS) is also proposed by extending the AF-BKF using the concept of Rauch&#x2013;Tung&#x2013;Striebel smoother for further smoothing the fascicle orientations. The experimental results and comparisons show that: 1) the maximum segmentation error of the proposed RCRT is below nine pixels, which is sufficiently small for MFO tracking; 2) the accuracy of MFO gauged by RT in the ROI enhanced by the GF is comparable to that of using multiscale vessel enhancement filter-based method and better than those of local RT and revoting Hough transform approaches; and 3) the proposed AF-BKS algorithm outperforms the other tested approaches and achieves a performance close to those obtained by experienced operators (the overall covariance obtained by the AF-BKS is 3.19, which is rather close to that of the operators, 2.86). It, thus, serves as a valuable tool for automatic estimation of fascicle orientations and possibly for other applications in musculoskeletal ultrasound images.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Inspired by the recent successes of deep architecture, the auto-encoder and its variants have been intensively explored on image clustering and classification tasks by learning effective feature representations. Conventional auto-encoder attempts to uncover the data&#x2019;s intrinsic structure, by constraining the output to be as much identical to the input as possible, which denotes that the hidden representation could faithfully reconstruct the input data. One issue that arises, however, is that such representations might not be optimized for specific tasks, e.g., image classification and clustering, since it compresses not only the discriminative information but also a lot of redundant or even noise within data. In other words, not all hidden units would benefit the specific tasks, while partial units are mainly used to represent the task-irrelevant patterns. In this paper, a general framework named discerning feature supported encoder (DFSE) is proposed, which integrates the auto-encoder and feature selection together into a unified model. Specifically, the feature selection is adapted to learned hidden-layer features to capture the task-relevant ones from the task-irrelevant ones. Meanwhile, the selected hidden units could in turn encode more discriminability only on the selected task-relevant units. To this end, our proposed algorithm can generate more effective image representation by distinguishing the task-relevant features from the task-irrelevant ones. Two scenarios of the experiments on image classification and clustering are conducted to evaluate our algorithm. The experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that our method can achieve better performance over the state-of-the-art approaches in two scenarios.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The tracking-by-detection framework receives growing attention through the integration with the convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Existing tracking-by-detection-based methods, however, fail to track objects with severe appearance variations. This is because the traditional convolutional operation is performed on fixed grids, and thus may not be able to find the correct response while the object is changing pose or under varying environmental conditions. In this paper, we propose a deformable convolution layer to enrich the target appearance representations in the tracking-by-detection framework. We aim to capture the target appearance variations via deformable convolution, which adaptively enhances its original features. In addition, we also propose a gated fusion scheme to control how the variations captured by the deformable convolution affect the original appearance. The enriched feature representation through deformable convolution facilitates the discrimination of the CNN classifier on the target object and background. The extensive experiments on the standard benchmarks show that the proposed tracker performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Multi-turn video question answering is a challenging task in visual information retrieval, which generates the accurate answer from the referenced video contents according to the visual conversation context and given question. However, the existing visual question answering methods mainly tackle the problem of single-turn video question answering, which may be ineffectively applied for multi-turn video question answering directly, due to the insufficiency of modeling the sequential conversation context. In this paper, we study the problem of multi-turn video question answering from the viewpoint of multi-stream hierarchical attention context reinforced network learning. We first propose the hierarchical attention context network for context-aware question understanding by modeling the hierarchically sequential conversation context structure. We then develop the multi-stream spatio-temporal attention network for learning the joint representation of the dynamic video contents and context-aware question embedding. We next devise a multi-step reasoning process to enhance the multi-stream hierarchical attention context network learning method. We finally predict the multiple-choice answer from the candidate answer set and further develop the reinforced decoder network to generate the open-ended natural language answer for multi-turn video question answering. We construct two large-scale multi-turn video question answering datasets. The extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method.

<p>Automated production systems are critical enablers for Industry 4.0 because these design-to-order, custom-built mechatronic systems are not only capable of delivering automation capabilities to satisfy the stakeholder requirements in the manufacturing/production domain, but doing so for a long period of time (e.g., several decades) during which numerous changing needs shall also be accounted for. Although traceability has long been recognized as key to sustain changes, little is known about how the traceability information is managed in place, i.e., in the native environments where the engineering artifacts reside. We contribute in this paper a survey of traceability support within state-of-the-practice tools: seven for programming logic controllers and six for building models in systems modeling language. We draw the similarities and differences from our survey results, and further present a design by leveraging the in-place traceability to better support the development and evolution of automated production systems.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a variable structure speed controller (VSSC) that guarantees the robust transient performance against the external disturbances and parameter uncertainties of an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive. Unlike the conventional VSSC applied to the IPMSMs, the proposed nonlinear compensating control term not only assures the robustness against the system uncertainties, but also implements the maximum torque per ampere technique. Furthermore, the convergence and stability of the proposed VSSC are fully proven through the Lyapunov theory by introducing reasonable bounded uncertainties which determine a feasible range for the system dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is investigated through the simulation using MATLAB/Simulink and experiment using a prototype IPMSM drive system with a TI TMS320F28335 DSP. Finally, the proposed VSSC can ensure faster and more robust transient response than the conventional proportional-integral speed controller under the dynamic load conditions including the uncertainties.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, an intelligent energy management framework with demand response capability was proposed for industrial facilities. The framework consists of multiple components, including industrial processes modeled by the state task network method, thermostatically controlled loads, like the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system with chilled water storage, renewable generation, like photovoltaic arrays and electric vehicles. These components are first modeled and their operation is then optimized in time-of-use pricing schemes. Factors that affect several components at the same time, e.g., the number of workers, are considered. The optimization is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem. A general tire manufacturing facility was investigated as the case study. Simulation results show that the proposed intelligent industrial energy management with demand response is able to effectively utilize the flexibility contained in all parts of the facility and reduce the electricity costs, as well as the peak demand of the facility, while satisfying all the operating constraints.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In recent years, great success has been achieved in visual object detection, which is one of the fundamental tasks in the field of industrial intelligence. Most of existing methods have been proposed to deal with single well-captured still images, while in practical robotic applications, due to nuisances, such as tiny scale, partial view, or occlusion, one still image may not contain enough information for object detection. However, an intelligent robot has the capability to adjust its viewpoint to get better images for detection. Therefore, active object detection becomes a very important perception strategy for intelligent robots. In this paper, by formulating active object detection as a sequential action decision process, a deep reinforcement learning framework is established to resolve it. Furthermore, a novel deep Q-learning network (DQN) with a dueling architecture is proposed, the network has two separate output channels, one predicts action type and the other predicts action range. By combining the two output channels, the action space is explored more efficiently. Several methods are extensively validated and the results show that the proposed one obtains the best results and predicts action in real time.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Converter-driven direct current (dc) motors exhibit various advantages in industry, but impose several challenges to higher precision speed regulation in the presence of parametric uncertainties and exogenous, time-varying load torque disturbances. In this paper, the robust predictive speed regulation problem of a generic dc&#x2013;dc buck converter-driven permanent magnet dc motors is addressed by using an output feedback discrete-time model predictive control algorithm. A new discrete-time reduced-order generalized proportional-integral observer (GPIO) is proposed to reconstruct the virtual system states as well as the lumped disturbances. The estimates of GPIO are then collected for output speed prediction. An optimized duty ratio law of the converter is obtained by solving a constrained receding horizon optimization problem, where the operational constraint on control input is explicitly taken into account. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed new algorithm is demonstrated by various experimental testing results.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the automated demand response (DR) problem in smart grids equipped with information and communication technology networks, where power generating and consuming units can exchange information as a multiagent system (MAS), and a real-time pricing (RTP) scheme is proposed. When the communication graph among agents is connected, a novel parallel and distributed consensus-based algorithm is proposed to derive an RTP scheme to facilitate DR, and when communication uncertainties exist, a robust consensus algorithm is proposed to cease the effect of uncertainties. Next, this paper proposes a novel control mechanism to tackle the problem of disconnected communication among agents, e.g., under cyber-attacks, by employing the so-called mixed communication-broadcast control architecture where the underlying ideas are twofold. First, each area in the grid associated with a connected subgraph is controlled by a MAS to guarantee the power balance and to reach consensus on the local electric price for that area. Second, a supervisory unit observes those local electric prices to calculate the global electric price for the whole grid and then broadcasts to all units so that they can properly adjust their output powers. Simulations are carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system to validate the proposed control mechanisms.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper presents an electric arc furnace (EAF) optimization framework intended to define optimal control profiles for the EAF, in order to increase its efficiency and thus reduce the energy consumption. The framework aims to minimize controllable losses and to maximize energy transfer to the bath and, consequently, minimize the operational costs. This is achieved through improved actuation of the EAF inputs, i.e., transformer power, oxygen lancing, and carbon addition. To achieve maximal energy transfer to the bath and to reduce the heat losses from the arcs, proper properties of the slag, such as foaminess and basicity, are a subject of considerable attention. The framework is designed as a model-based optimization, intended to be executed online in parallel to the actual EAF process. In order to achieve sufficiently low computational complexity and to allow process optimization by arbitrary time intervals, the framework uses path constraints instead of end-point constraints. A combination of several optimization algorithms is used to solve the optimization problem. The validation of the framework was performed by comparing the predicted and the measured operational variables. Simulation results show that optimized operation profiles lead to a significant decrease in operational costs and production times.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>High control bandwidth is usually restricted in a finite sampling rate of a charge-coupled device (CCD)-based tracking loop, which hinders a good closed-loop performance. Conventionally, a rate feedforward controller is usually used to improve the control performance; however, it is restricted by the line-of-sight (LOS) rate, which is required to be estimated due to only the LOS error available in the CCD-based tracking control system. Besides that, it is also affected by the inverse of the control model. A new error-based feedforward (EBF) control mode is proposed to overcome these difficulties. Due to being plugged into an existing feedback control loop, the closed-loop performance of the CCD-based control system can be minimized by optimizing a Q-filter. The closed-loop stability and robustness with this EBF control system are investigated on the condition of the gain margin and the phase margin of the open-loop transfer function. Furthermore, this paper proposes a new criterion to enhance the robustness of the EBF control system and reveals the sensitivity function property. Because of not being restricted by an accurate model, this new feedforward controller cannot lead to a compromise between error attenuation and noise propagation in the control loop. Simulations and experiments are both used to testify the effectiveness of the improved control mode.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper describes an augmented reality (AR)-aided smart sensing technique for in-line condition monitoring of insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) wafers. A series of signal processing algorithms are applied for enabling sensor intelligence. Based on electromagnetic infrared&#x2013;visible fusion (IVF), a supplementary palpable three-dimensional thermography layer is integrated with an IGBT wafer in real world environment. Before the IVF, independent component analysis is implemented to identify defects in the wafer. The proposed AR-aided smart sensing technique enhances user&#x0027;s perception and interaction between the industrial systems and the surrounding world. In contrast to conventional sensor techniques, it provides nondestructive testing and evaluation based high-throughput in-line condition monitoring method. The advantages of noncontact and time efficient of this smart sensing technique potentially bring huge benefit to yield management and production efficiency. AR-aided smart sensing can improve the productivity, quality, and reliability of power electronic materials and devices, as well as in other industrial applications.
