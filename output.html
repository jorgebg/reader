<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Despite achieving remarkable performance on many image classification tasks,
state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) classifiers remain vulnerable to small
input perturbations. Especially, the existence of adversarial examples raises
concerns about the deployment of ML models in safety- and security-critical
environments, like autonomous driving and disease detection. Over the last few
years, numerous defense methods have been published with the goal of improving
adversarial as well as corruption robustness. However, the proposed measures
succeeded only to a very limited extent. This limited progress is partly due to
the lack of understanding of the decision boundary and decision regions of deep
neural networks. Therefore, we study the minimum distance of data points to the
decision boundary and how this margin evolves over the training of a deep
neural network. By conducting experiments on MNIST, FASHION-MNIST, and
CIFAR-10, we observe that the decision boundary moves closer to natural images
over training. This phenomenon even remains intact in the late epochs of
training, where the classifier already obtains low training and test error
rates. On the other hand, adversarial training appears to have the potential to
prevent this undesired convergence of the decision boundary.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Sidechains are an appealing innovation devised to enable blockchain
scalability and extensibility. The basic idea is simple yet powerful: construct
a parallel chain -- sidechain -- with desired features, and provide a way to
transfer coins between the mainchain and the sidechain.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we introduce Zendoo, a construction for Bitcoin-like
blockchain systems that allows the creation and communication with sidechains
of different types without knowing their internal structure. We consider a
parent-child relationship between the mainchain and sidechains, where sidechain
nodes directly observe the mainchain while mainchain nodes only observe
cryptographically authenticated certificates from sidechain maintainers. We use
zk-SNARKs to construct a universal verifiable transfer mechanism that is used
by sidechains.
</p>
<p>Moreover, we propose a specific sidechain construction, named Latus, that can
be built on top of this infrastructure, and realizes a decentralized verifiable
blockchain system for payments. We leverage the use of recursive composition of
zk-SNARKs to generate succinct proofs of sidechain state progression that are
used to generate certificates' validity proofs. This allows the mainchain to
efficiently verify all operations performed in the sidechain without knowing
any details about those operations.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Data privacy protection is an important research area, which is especially
critical in this big data era. To a large extent, the privacy of visual
classification tasks is mainly in the one-to-one mapping between image and its
corresponding label, since this relation provides a great amount of information
and can be used in other scenarios. In this paper, we propose Mapping
Distortion Protection (MDP) and its augmentation-based extension (AugMDP) to
protect the data privacy by modifying the original dataset. In MDP, the label
of the modified image does not match the ground-truth mapping, yet DNNs can
still learn the ground-truth relation even when the provided mapping is
distorted. As such, this method protects privacy when the dataset is leaked.
Extensive experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10 and restricted CASIA-WebFace
dataset, which verifies the effectiveness and feasibility of the method.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Eye tracking is handled as one of the key technologies for applications which
assess and evaluate human attention, behavior and biometrics, especially using
gaze, pupillary and blink behaviors. One of the main challenges with regard to
the social acceptance of eye-tracking technology is however the preserving of
sensitive and personal information. To tackle this challenge, we employed a
privacy-preserving framework based on randomized encoding to train a Support
Vector Regression model on synthetic eye images privately to estimate human
gaze. During the computation, none of the parties learns about the data or the
result that any other party has. Furthermore, the party that trains the model
cannot reconstruct pupil, blink or visual scanpath. The experimental results
showed that our privacy preserving framework is also capable of working in
real-time, as accurate as a non-private version of it and could be extended to
other eye-tracking related problems.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We assess the security of machine learning based biometric authentication
systems against an attacker who submits uniform random inputs, either as
feature vectors or raw inputs, in order to find an accepting sample of a target
user. The average false positive rate (FPR) of the system, i.e., the rate at
which an impostor is incorrectly accepted as the legitimate user, may be
interpreted as a measure of the success probability of such an attack. However,
we show that the success rate is often higher than the FPR. In particular, for
one reconstructed biometric system with an average FPR of 0.03, the success
rate was as high as 0.78. This has implications for the security of the system,
as an attacker with only the knowledge of the length of the feature space can
impersonate the user with less than 2 attempts on average. We provide detailed
analysis of why the attack is successful, and validate our results using four
different biometric modalities and four different machine learning classifiers.
Finally, we propose mitigation techniques that render such attacks ineffective,
with little to no effect on the accuracy of the system.

<p>The desire to prolong human life requires no defense, nor is it difficult to understand. Death is rarely a welcomed visitor in the human household; and it is quite natural that thinking minds should have occupied themselves with the possibility of averting death. As Jacques Loeb has remarked, the efforts to prolong life have resulted merely in a diminution of the chances of premature death. Modern preventive medicine has succeeded in warding off many menaces to life by conquering some of the dangerous infectious diseases and even threatening contagions. At best, however, by such accomplishments each person is merely guaranteed with greater degree of probability that he may enjoy the full usual duration of life. Death is not averted.

<p>Refined approaches are needed to better risk-stratify patients with colorectal cancer for prognosis. No predictive biomarkers of treatment efficacy have yet been identified in patients with non-metastatic disease. Ole-Johan Skrede and colleagues1 in The Lancet report on a computer-generated biomarker, the DoMore-v1-colorectal cancer (DoMore-v1-CRC) classifier, which was derived from conventionally stained histopathological images by using deep learning methods. This study adds value to the application of deep learning methods in cancer research as it stimulates a discussion on the potential use of automated methods to generate new information from existing pathological data.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>People constantly share their photographs with others through various social media sites. With the aid of the privacy settings provided by social media sites, image owners can designate scope of sharing, e.g., close friends and acquaintances. However, even if the owner of a photograph carefully sets the privacy setting to exclude a given individual who is not supposed to see the photograph, the photograph may still eventually reach a wider audience, including those clearly undesired through unanticipated channels of disclosure, causing a privacy breach. Moreover, it is often the case that a given image involves multiple stakeholders who are also depicted in the photograph. Due to various personalities, it is even more challenging to reach agreement on the privacy settings for these multi-owner photographs. In this paper, we propose a privacy risk reminder system, called REMIND, which estimates the probability that a shared photograph may be seen by unwanted people-through the social graph-who are not included in the original sharing list. We tackle this problem from a novel angle by digging into the big data regarding image sharing history. Specifically, the social media providers possess a huge amount of image sharing information (e.g., what photographs are shared with whom) of their users. By analyzing and modeling such rich information, we build a sophisticated probability model that efficiently aggregates the image disclosure probabilities along different possible image propagation chains and loops. If the computed disclosure probability indicates high risks of privacy breach, a reminder is issued to the image owner to help revise the privacy settings (or, at least, inform the user about this accidental disclosure risk). The proposed REMIND system also has a nice feature of policy harmonization that helps resolve privacy differences in multi-owner photographs. We have carried out a user study to validate the rationale of our proposed solutions and also conducte-
 experimental studies to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed REMIND system.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

<p>Online romance scams are a prevalent form of mass-marketing fraud in the West, and yet few studies have presented data-driven responses to this problem. In this type of scam, fraudsters craft fake profiles and manually interact with their victims. Because of the characteristics of this type of fraud and how dating sites operate, traditional detection methods (e.g., those used in spam filtering) are ineffective. In this paper, we investigate the archetype of online dating profiles used in this form of fraud, including their use of demographics, profile descriptions, and images, shedding light on both the strategies deployed by scammers to appeal to victims and the traits of victims themselves. Furthermore, in response to the severe financial and psychological harm caused by dating fraud, we develop a system to detect romance scammers on online dating platforms. This paper presents the first fully described system for automatically detecting this fraud. Our aim is to provide an early detection system to stop romance scammers as they create fraudulent profiles or before they engage with potential victims. Previous research has indicated that the victims of romance scams score highly on scales for idealized romantic beliefs. We combine a range of structured, unstructured, and deep-learned features that capture these beliefs in order to build a detection system. Our ensemble machine-learning approach is robust to the omission of profile details and performs at high accuracy (97%) in a hold-out validation set. The system enables development of automated tools for dating site providers and individual users.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We investigate the effect of outdated channel state information (CSI) on the secrecy performance of wireless-powered untrusted relay networks, in which the relay is a potential eavesdropper. To keep the information secret from this untrusted relay, the destination sends a jamming signal to the relay when the source transmits an information signal. At the same time, the relay harvests energy from the radio-frequency power, and forwards the received signals to the destination using this harvested energy. To determine the proportions of energy harvesting and information processing, the relay makes use of relaying based on power splitting or time switching policy. Although the destination tries to remove the jamming signal from the relaying signal, it cannot cancel out the jamming signal perfectly due to imperfect channel reciprocity caused by the outdated CSI; this residual jamming signal therefore has a negative impact on secrecy performance. In this scenario, we derive the closed-form expressions for the outage probability and average secrecy rate, and find the jamming power ratio, power splitting ratio, and time switching ratio to optimize these secrecy performance metrics. The numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of our analysis, and show that the proposed secure relaying protocols achieve a near-optimal secrecy performance, as well as outperforming the conventional scheme without the jamming power control.

<p>This study presents a deep neural network architecture that achieves state of the art multi-session verification and identification performance for Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission (TEOAE) biometric system. TEOAE is a 20ms long response generated by the ear that is naturally strong against falsification, and replay attacks. It can be measured using a device with a speaker and multiple microphones. Previous TEAOE authentication methods focused on single-session or mixed-session performance. Our method focuses on multi-session authentication performance. We train a neural network model that generates a TEOAE embedding that is separable in Euclidean space by using the triplet loss function. These embeddings are used to create identity templates which are used to authenticate the user. We achieved identification accuracy of 99.3 &#x00b1; 1.04&#x0025;, and achieved an EER(Equal Error Rate) of 0.187 &#x00b1; 0.146&#x0025; for verification scenarios. Our method has achieved 7.56&#x0025; performance increase for identification scenarios and 13.3&#x0025; performance increase for verification scenarios over previous methods when averaged across all tests.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Benefiting from the quick development of deep convolutional neural networks, especially fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), remarkable progresses have been achieved on salient object detection recently. Nevertheless, these FCNs based methods are still challenging to generate high resolution saliency maps, and also not applicable for subsequent applications due to their heavy model weights. In this paper, we propose a compact and efficient deep network with high accuracy for salient object detection. Firstly, we propose two strategies for initial prediction, one is a new designed multi-scale context module, the other is incorporating hand-crafted saliency priors. Secondly, we employ residual learning to refine it progressively by only learning the residual in each side-output, which can be achieved with few convolutional parameters, therefore leads to high compactness and high efficiency. Finally, we further design a novel top-down reverse attention block to guide the above side-output residual learning. Specifically, the current predicted salient regions are used to erase its side-output feature, thus the missing object parts and details can be efficiently learned from these unerased regions, which results in more complete detection and high accuracy. Extensive experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed network performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches, and shows advantages in simplicity, compactness and efficiency.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Seismic image interpolation is a currently popular research subject in modern reflection seismology. The interpolation problem is generally treated as a process of inversion. Under the compressed sensing framework, various sparse transformations and low-rank constraints based methods have great performances in recovering irregularly missing traces. However, in the case of regularly missing traces, their applications are limited because of the strong spatial aliasing energies. In addition, the erratic noise always poses a serious impact on the interpolation results obtained by the sparse transformations and low-rank constraints-based methods,. This is because the erratic noise is far from satisfying the statistical assumption behind these methods. In this study, we propose a mathematical morphology-based interpolation technique, which constrains the morphological scale of the model in the inversion process. The inversion problem is solved by the shaping regularization approach. The mathematical morphological constraint (MMC)-based interpolation technique has a satisfactory robustness to the spatial aliasing and erratic energies. We provide a detailed algorithmic framework and discuss the extension from 2D to higher dimensional version and the back operator in the shaping inversion. A group of numerical examples demonstrates the successful performance of the proposed technique.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The human visual system tends to consider saliency of an object as a whole. Some object-level saliency detection methods have been proposed by leveraging object proposals in bounding boxes, and regarding the entire bounding box as one candidate salient region. However, the bounding boxes can not provide exact object position and a lot of pixels in bounding boxes belong to the background. Consequently, background pixels in bounding box also show high saliency. Besides, acquiring object proposals needs high time cost. In order to compute object-level saliency, we consider region growing from some seed superpixels, to find one surrounding region which probably represents the whole object. The desired surrounding region has similar appearance inside and obvious difference with the outside, which is proposed as maximally stable region (MSR) in this paper. In addition, one effective seed superpixel selection strategy is presented to improve speed. MSR based saliency detection is more robust than pixel or superpixel level methods and object proposal based methods. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods at 50 FPS. Compared with deep learning based methods, we show worse performance, but with about 1200-1600 times faster, which means better trade-off between performance and speed.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we develop a concise but efficient network architecture called linear compressing based skip-connecting network (LCSCNet) for image super-resolution. Compared with two representative network architectures with skip connections, ResNet and DenseNet, a linear compressing layer is designed in LCSCNet for skip connection, which connects former feature maps and distinguishes them from newly-explored feature maps. In this way, the proposed LCSCNet enjoys the merits of the distinguish feature treatment of DenseNet and the parameter-economic form of ResNet. Moreover, to better exploit hierarchical information from both low and high levels of various receptive fields in deep models, inspired by gate units in LSTM, we also propose an adaptive element-wise fusion strategy with multi-supervised training. Experimental results in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms validate the effectiveness of LCSCNet.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Previous research on no-reference (NR) quality assessment of multiply-distorted images focused mainly on three distortion types (white noise, Gaussian blur, and JPEG compression), while in practice images can be contaminated by many other common distortions due to the various stages of processing. Although MUSIQUE (MUltiply- and Singly-distorted Image QUality Estimator) [Zhang et al., TIP 2018] is a successful NR algorithm, this approach is still limited to the three distortion types. In this paper, we extend MUSIQUE to MUSIQUE-II to blindly assess the quality of images corrupted by five distortion types (white noise, Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, JPEG2000 compression, and contrast change) and their combinations. The proposed MUSIQUE-II algorithm builds upon the classification and parameter-estimation framework of its predecessor by using more advanced models and a more comprehensive set of distortion-sensitive features. Specifically, MUSIQUE-II relies on a three-layer classification model to identify 19 distortion types. To predict the five distortion parameter values, MUSIQUE-II extracts an additional 14 contrast features and employs a multi-layer probability-weighting rule. Finally, MUSIQUE-II employs a new most-apparent-distortion strategy to adaptively combine five quality scores based on outputs of three classification models. Experimental results tested on three multiply-distorted and six singly-distorted image quality databases show that MUSIQUE-II yields not only a substantial improvement in quality predictive performance as compared with its predecessor, but also highly competitive performance relative to other state-of-the-art FR/NR IQA algorithms.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this article, we develop a navigation strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for mobile robots. Because of the large difference between simulation and reality, most of the trained DRL models cannot be directly migrated into real robots. Moreover, how to explore in a sparsely rewarded environment is also a long-standing problem of DRL. This article proposes an end-to-end navigation planner that translates sparse laser ranging results into movement actions. Using this highly abstract data as input, agents trained by simulation can be extended to the real scene for practical application. For map-less navigation across obstacles and traps, it is difficult to reach the target via random exploration. Curiosity is used to encourage agents to explore the state of an environment that has not been visited and as an additional reward for exploring behavior. The agent relies on the self-supervised model to predict the next state, based on the current state and the executed action. The prediction error is used as a measure of curiosity. The experimental results demonstrate that without any manual design features and previous demonstrations, the proposed method accomplishes map-less navigation in complex environments. Through a reward signal that is enhanced by intrinsic motivation, the agent explores more efficiently, and the learned strategy is more reliable.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Artificial intelligence methods applied in smart home environments can give a ubiquitous support of people, provide automatic control of system settings to lower the costs of operation, improve energetic efficiency, and longer endurance of components. In this article, we discuss the use of neural networks and rule-based systems as the components of automatic control over house elements. In the proposed framework, we store the knowledge and teach the system about the home in parallel to operation. Initially, the system starts with global settings, however, data are collected during use and parallel to this regular training is run so when the new knowledge guarantees higher efficiency, the system switch to use it. We have developed a new neural-based mechanism with rules control method to lower the costs of operation while keeping the needs of users. The components were tested and discussed due to practical application in our everyday life.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In modern Internet of Things (IoT), visual analysis and predictions are often performed by deep learning models. Salient object detection (SOD) is a fundamental preprocessing for these applications. Executing SOD on the fog devices is a challenging task due to the diversity of data and fog devices. To adopt convolutional neural networks (CNN) on fog&#x2013;cloud infrastructures for SOD-based applications, we introduce a semisupervised adversarial learning method in this article. The proposed model, named as SaliencyGAN, is empowered by a novel concatenated generative adversarial network (GAN) framework with partially shared parameters. The backbone CNN can be chosen flexibly based on the specific devices and applications. In the meanwhile, our method uses both the labeled and unlabeled data from different problem domains for training. Using multiple popular benchmark datasets, we compared state-of-the-art baseline methods to our SaliencyGAN obtained with 10&#x2013;100&#x0025; labeled training data. SaliencyGAN gained performance comparable to the supervised baselines when the percentage of labeled data reached 30&#x0025;, and outperformed the weakly supervised and unsupervised baselines. Furthermore, our ablation study shows that SaliencyGAN were more robust to the common &#x201c;mode missing&#x201d; (or &#x201c;mode collapse&#x201d;) issue compared to the selected popular GAN models. The visualized ablation results have proved that SaliencyGAN learned a better estimation of data distributions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first IoT-oriented semisupervised SOD method.

<p>This article proposes a hybrid intelligent-classic control approach for reconstruction and compensation of cyber attacks launched on inputs of nonlinear cyber-physical systems (CPS) and industrial Internet of Things systems, which work through shared communication networks. In this article, a class of n-order nonlinear systems is considered as a model of CPS while it is in presence of cyber attacks only in the forward channel. An intelligent-classic control system is developed to compensate cyber-attacks. Neural network (NN) is designed as an intelligent estimator for attack estimation and a classic nonlinear control system based on the variable structure control method is designed to compensate the effect of attacks and control the system performance in tracking applications. In the proposed strategy, nonlinear control theory is applied to guarantee the stability of the system when attacks happen. In this strategy, a Gaussian radial basis function NN is used for online estimation and reconstruction of cyber-attacks launched on the networked system. An adaptation law of the intelligent estimator is derived from a Lyapunov function. Simulation results demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed strategy in car cruise control application as the testbed.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Scheduling of a hot strip mill is an important decision problem in the steel manufacturing industry. Previous studies on the hot strip mill scheduling problem have mostly neglected the random factors in production. However, random variations in processing times are inevitable due to unpredictable delays and disturbances. In this article, we adopt a robust optimization approach to deal with the uncertainty in processing times. The advantage is that no assumption has to be made regarding the distribution of random data, and the obtained schedule will remain strictly feasible when the variations have not exceeded a predefined uncertainty set. First, a mixed-integer linear programming model is presented to formulate the robust scheduling problem. Then, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm, which combines ant colony system (ACS) and enhanced local search, is proposed to provide an efficient solution to the problem. Finally, extensive computational experiments involving both randomly generated and real-world instances have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. It is shown that the algorithm achieves optimality for small instances and outperforms two state-of-the-art metaheuristics when used to solve large instances.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The rotor structure of synchronous reluctance machines (SynRel) is conventionally retained mechanically by iron ribs. In this paper, a novel structure for high-speed synchronous reluctance rotor is presented. The novelty of this paper is the proof of a concept of SynRel machine without iron ribs. Structurally, the rotor iron lamination segments are embedded in an adhesive resin material with high temperature resistance and mechanical strength. Three four-pole SynRel machines have been designed with the target of improving motor torque, and compared for different ribs configuration. It has been shown that the proposed motor performs enhanced torque, power factor, and efficiency with respect to conventional SynRel with iron ribs. An extensive sensitivity analysis of the ribless rotor geometry is carried out, followed by both mechanical analysis and experimental over speed test to guarantee its robustness above the operating speed range. The manufacturing procedure of this novel rotor is introduced. Finally, the experimental results on both SynRel prototypes are presented, showing the increase in torque, power factor, and efficiency of the proposed solution. This paper is a first step toward the definition of a viable and novel solution of SynRel machines with improved performance.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>DC winding induced voltage pulsation in wound field switched flux (WFSF) machines causes dc winding current ripple and field excitation fluctuation, challenges the dc power source, and deteriorates the control performance. Hence, reducing this pulsation is important in the design of a WFSF machine. In this paper, based on the analytical models, rotor skewing and rotor iron piece pairing are proposed and comparatively investigated by the finite-element (FE) method to reduce the on-load dc winding induced voltage in WFSF machines having partitioned stators and concentrated ac windings. FE results show that peak-to-peak value of the on-load dc winding induced voltage in the analyzed 12&#x002f;10-pole partitioned stator WFSF (PS-WFSF) machines can be reduced by 78.42&#x0025; or 77.16&#x0025; by using rotor skewing or rotor pairing, respectively, while the torque density can be maintained by &gt;90&#x0025;. As for the 12&#x002f;11-, 12&#x002f;13-, and 12&#x002f;14-pole PS-WFSF machines, by using rotor iron piece inner arc pairing, the on-load dc winding induced voltage can be reduced by 64.11&#x0025;, 52.12&#x0025;, and 76.49&#x0025;, respectively, while the torque density can be maintained by more than 90&#x0025;. Prototypes are built and tested to verify the analytical and FE results.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Squirrel-cage induction motor (SQIM) fed by a pulsewidth modulated voltage source inverter (VSI) is subjected to voltage and current surges. It may cause additional losses in the motor, insulation failure, high bearing current, and electromagnetic interference. To mitigate these problems, sinusoidal LC filter is placed at the ac-side of the VSI. This paper proposes a new methodology to design the filter. In this method, the filter inductance is chosen based on the maximum ripple in the inverter ac-side current and the voltage drop across the filter inductor, and the filter capacitor is chosen based on the steady-state reactive power demand of the SQIM. The effects of the designed filter on the switch current, losses in the drive, temperature of the dc-link capacitor, dv&#x002f;dt at the motor terminal, stator flux, and air-gap torque of the SQIM are discussed. The performance of the drive with the filters, designed by the proposed method and the standard method, are experimentally tested on a two-level silicon carbide VSI-fed SQIM and comparative analysis is carried out. The impact of the designed filter on the drive is also shown when the neutral point of the filter capacitors is connected with the mid-point of the dc link. The stability of the closed-loop controlled SQIM drive with the proposed filter, and simulation results are presented to verify its performance.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The fast detection of magnitude, frequency, and phase angle of the fundamental-frequency component is very useful in many three-phase power system applications. Most techniques to accomplish this task are based on different versions of three-phase phase-locked loop (PLL) schemes. Some variables of three-phase systems may experience phase angle jumps after some disturbances. In this paper, a method for the fast detection of phase angle jump occurrence, estimation of the phase angle jump, and its use for improving the performance of the generalized delayed signal cancelation (GDSC) PLL is proposed. The proposed method is based on the detailed evaluation of the GDSC filter transient behavior after a phase jump. Results considering typical three-phase grid disturbances are used to evaluate the proposed scheme, in comparison with other usual PLL techniques. The use of the proposed phase jump angle estimator allowed a reduction in the GDSC-PLL convergence time of about 50&#x0025;.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The relative pose control problem for spacecraft rendezvous and docking missions in the presence of control input constraints, actuator&#x0027;s partial failures, and unknown external disturbances is studied in this paper. A smoothly adaptive fault-tolerant constrained controller is developed based on the adaptive nonlinear state feedback method. Different from the traditional fault-tolerant saturated controllers, the proposed control approach explicitly accounts for the control input constraints with straightforward tuning parameters in controller. Meanwhile, the exact knowledge of the actuator failures is not required and uncertain failure information can be rejected. A smooth control signal containing simple saturation functions is designed, and the unknown bounded external disturbances can be rejected by the proposed method. The proposed controller can ensure ultimately, uniformly bounded stability of the closed-loop system, where relative pose and velocities converge to the small neighborhoods of zero. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.
