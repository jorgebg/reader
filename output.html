</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper introduces a new similarity measure, the covering similarity, which we formally define for evaluating the similarity between a symbolic sequence and a set of symbolic sequences. A pairwise similarity can also be directly derived from the covering similarity to compare two symbolic sequences. An efficient implementation to compute the covering similarity is proposed which uses a suffix-tree data structure, but other implementations, based on suffix array for instance, are possible and are possibly necessary for handling very large-scale problems. We have used this similarity to isolate attack sequences from normal sequences in the scope of host-based intrusion detection. We have assessed the covering similarity on two well-known benchmarks in the field. In view of the results reported on these two datasets for the state-of-the-art methods, according to the comparative study, we have carried out based on three challenging similarity measures commonly used for string processing, or in bioinformatics, we show that the covering similarity is particularly relevant to address the detection of anomalies in sequences of system calls.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Minimal distortion steganography is the most successful model for adaptive steganography, in which the cost function determines the security. Texture complexity is the major factor in defining cost function in images. In this paper, we proposed a method to improve the cost function of JPEG steganography by exploiting the texture in microscale. The proposed scheme is designed by using a &#x201c;microscope&#x201d; to highlight details in an image, so that distortion definition can be more refined. Linear unsharp masking acts as the microscope, because it can accentuate the texture region as well as maintain the original characteristics of images. Inter-block spreading rule is proposed to further strengthen the security. We improve the state-of-the-art schemes, J-UNIWARD and UERD, as J-UNIWARD has outstanding performance on resisting detection while UERD has significant lower computational complexity. In order to keep high efficiency of UERD, filtering in the DCT domain is introduced. Extending experiments show that in most cases the proposed methods (J-MSUNIWARD and MSUERD) can achieve a higher level of security than the original methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) method for natural image matting. Our method takes multiple initial alpha mattes of the previous methods and normalized RGB color images as inputs, and directly learns an end-to-end mapping between the inputs and reconstructed alpha mattes. Among the various existing methods, we focus on using two simple methods as initial alpha mattes: the closed-form matting and KNN matting. They are complementary to each other in terms of local and nonlocal principles. A major benefit of our method is that it can &#x201c;recognize&#x201d; different local image structures and then combine the results of local (closed-form matting) and nonlocal (KNN matting) mattings effectively to achieve higher quality alpha mattes than both of the inputs. Furthermore, we verify extendability of the proposed network to different combinations of initial alpha mattes from more advanced techniques such as KL divergence matting and information-flow matting. On the top of deep CNN matting, we build an RGB guided JPEG artifacts removal network to handle JPEG block artifacts in alpha matting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed deep CNN matting produces visually and quantitatively high-quality alpha mattes. We perform deeper experiments including studies to evaluate the importance of balancing training data and to measure the effects of initial alpha mattes and also consider results from variant versions of the proposed network to analyze our proposed DCNN matting. In addition, our method achieved high ranking in the public alpha matting evaluation dataset in terms of the sum of absolute differences, mean squared errors, and gradient errors. Also, our RGB guided JPEG artifacts removal network restores the damaged alpha mattes from compressed images in JPEG format.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel depth restoration algorithm from RGB-D data through combining characteristics of local and non-local manifolds, which provide low-dimensional parameterizations of the local and non-local geometry of depth maps. Specifically, on the one hand, a local manifold model is defined to favor local neighboring relationship of pixels in depth, according to which, manifold regularization is introduced to promote smoothing along the manifold structure. On the other hand, the non-local characteristics of the patch-based manifold can be used to build highly data-adaptive orthogonal bases to extract elongated image patterns, accounting for self-similar structures in the manifold. We further define a manifold thresholding operator in 3D adaptive orthogonal spectral bases&#x2014;eigenvectors of the discrete Laplacian of local and non-local manifolds&#x2014;to retain only low graph frequencies for depth maps restoration. Finally, we propose a unified alternating direction method of multipliers optimization framework, which elegantly casts the adaptive manifold regularization and thresholding jointly to regularize the inverse problem of depth maps recovery. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art works with respect to both objective and subjective quality evaluations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A common problem in wide-baseline matching is the sparse and non-uniform distribution of correspondences when using conventional detectors, such as SIFT, SURF, FAST, A-KAZE, and MSER. In this paper, we introduce a novel segmentation-based feature detector (SFD) that produces an increased number of accurate features for wide-baseline matching. A multi-scale SFD is proposed using bilateral image decomposition to produce a large number of scale-invariant features for wide-baseline reconstruction. All input images are over-segmented into regions using any existing segmentation technique, such as Watershed, Mean-shift, and simple linear iterative clustering. Feature points are then detected at the intersection of the boundaries of three or more regions. The detected feature points are local maxima of the image function. The key advantage of feature detection based on segmentation is that it does not require global threshold setting and can, therefore, detect features throughout the image. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SFD gives an increased number of features that are accurately localized and matched between wide-baseline camera views; the number of features for a given matching error increases by a factor of 3&#x2013;5 compared with SIFT; feature detection and matching performance are maintained with increasing baseline between views; multi-scale SFD improves matching performance at varying scales. Application of SFD to sparse multi-view wide-baseline reconstruction demonstrates a factor of 10 increases in the number of reconstructed points with improved scene coverage compared with SIFT/MSER/A-KAZE. Evaluation against ground-truth shows that SFD produces an increased number of wide-baseline matches with a reduced error.

<p>Inverse problems appear in many applications, such as image deblurring and inpainting. The common approach to address them is to design a specific algorithm for each problem. The Plug-and-Play (P&#x0026;P) framework, which has been recently introduced, allows solving general inverse problems by leveraging the impressive capabilities of existing denoising algorithms. While this fresh strategy has found many applications, a burdensome parameter tuning is often required in order to obtain high-quality results. In this paper, we propose an alternative method for solving inverse problems using off-the-shelf denoisers, which requires less parameter tuning. First, we transform a typical cost function, composed of fidelity and prior terms, into a closely related, novel optimization problem. Then, we propose an efficient minimization scheme with a P&#x0026;P property, i.e., the prior term is handled solely by a denoising operation. Finally, we present an automatic tuning mechanism to set the method&#x2019;s parameters. We provide a theoretical analysis of the method and empirically demonstrate its competitiveness with task-specific techniques and the P&#x0026;P approach for image inpainting and deblurring.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A graph is usually formed to reveal the relationship between data points and graph structure is encoded by the affinity matrix. Most graph-based multiview clustering methods use predefined affinity matrices and the clustering performance highly depends on the quality of graph. We learn a consensus graph with minimizing disagreement between different views and constraining the rank of the Laplacian matrix. Since diverse views admit the same underlying cluster structure across multiple views, we use a new disagreement cost function for regularizing graphs from different views toward a common consensus. Simultaneously, we impose a rank constraint on the Laplacian matrix to learn the consensus graph with exactly  $k$  connected components where  $k$  is the number of clusters, which is different from using fixed affinity matrices in most existing graph-based methods. With the learned consensus graph, we can directly obtain the cluster labels without performing any post-processing, such as  $k$ -means clustering algorithm in spectral clustering-based methods. A multiview consensus clustering method is proposed to learn such a graph. An efficient iterative updating algorithm is derived to optimize the proposed challenging optimization problem. Experiments on several benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of seven metrics.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Online social networks (OSNs) are providing a variety of applications for human users to interact with families, friends, and even strangers. One such application, the friend search engine, allows the general public to query individual users&#x2019; friend lists and has been gaining popularity recently. However, without proper design, this application may mistakenly disclose users&#x2019; private relationship information. Our previous work has proposed a privacy preservation solution that can effectively boost OSNs&#x2019; sociability while protecting users&#x2019; friendship privacy against attacks launched by individual malicious requestors. In this paper, we propose an advanced collusion attack, where a victim user&#x2019;s friendship privacy can be compromised through a series of carefully designed queries coordinately launched by multiple malicious requestors. The effect of the proposed collusion attack is validated through synthetic and real-world social network data sets. The in-depth research on the advanced collusion attacks will help us design a more robust and secure friend search engine on OSNs in the near future.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Three-dimensional mask spoofing attacks have been one of the main challenges in face recognition. Compared with a 3D mask, a real face displays different facial motion patterns that are reflected by different facial dynamic textures. However, a large portion of these facial motion differences is subtle. We find that the subtle facial motion can be fully captured by multiple deep dynamic textures from a convolutional layer of a convolutional neural network, but not all deep dynamic textures from different spatial regions and different channels of a convolutional layer are useful for differentiation of subtle motions between real faces and 3D masks. In this paper, we propose a novel feature learning model to learn discriminative deep dynamic textures for 3D mask face anti-spoofing. A novel joint discriminative learning strategy is further incorporated in the learning model to jointly learn the spatial- and channel-discriminability of the deep dynamic textures. The proposed joint discriminative learning strategy can be used to adaptively weight the discriminability of the learned feature from different spatial regions or channels, which ensures that more discriminative deep dynamic textures play more important roles in face/mask classification. Experiments on several publicly available data sets validate that the proposed method achieves promising results in intra- and cross-data set scenarios.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we consider user scheduling and power allocation techniques for downlinks where transmitted message must be kept confidential from all other unintended users and the number of users is larger than that of access point (AP) antennas. In order to maximize network secrecy rate with a limited number of antennas, the AP schedules a user who can achieve the largest secrecy rate and exploits multiple antennas for transmitting artificial noise to the unintended users. We derive the closed-form expressions of the optimal power allocation for the artificial noise and the average network secrecy rate through asymptotic analysis. The analysis results provide the insightful information on the behaviors of the user scheduling and the effect of system parameters on the network secrecy rate performance. It is shown that opportunistic scheduling with artificial noise transmission technique is more effective than the conventional precoding techniques for multiple confidential message transmissions in terms of network secrecy rate. Furthermore, we have also discussed a transmission strategy for the worst case scenarios where all unintended users are treated as colluding eavesdroppers. The simulations confirm the validity of the analysis results and provide additional information on the network performance in general cases.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To improve the power transfer efficiency in wireless power transfer systems, a novel configuration of a magnetic resonant structure is proposed in this paper. According to the analytical expression of mutual inductance, the magnetic field can be improved by weakening the demagnetizing factor for coils with a ferrite core. In this paper, the demagnetizing factors of a cylindrical ferrite core and a novel ferrite core are investigated. Compared with the cylindrical ferrite core, the proposed ferrite core has a smaller demagnetizing factor and an increased mutual inductance. In addition, the magnetic field through the receiving coil is enhanced due to the thin ferrite axis where the magnetic field is concentrated. The proposed ferrite core is designed and analyzed. Moreover, the effects of pitch and lateral misalignment, as well as the number of turns of the receiving coil, the core loss, and the load, are studied. Experimental prototypes are established to validate the performance of the wireless power transfer system with different types of receiving structures. The results indicate that the proposed structure is superior to others and that it shows better performance in power transfer efficiency and transfer distance, which is in good agreement with the theoretical and simulation analysis.

<p>Micro-short-circuit (MSC) is a latent risk in power batteries, which may give rise to thermal runaway and even catastrophic safety hazards. The motivation of this paper is to quantitatively analyze MSC in an initial stage, particularly for lithium-ion batteries. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, an equivalent MSC experiment is carried out. Based on a cell difference model, the cell state of charge (SOC) differences with the mean SOC for a battery pack are estimated by extended Kalman filter. The evaluated SOC difference can track the actual value well. Furthermore, an MSC diagnostic method is developed by employing recursive least squares filter. The method is demonstrated to examine the short-circuit resistance accurately. The results also show that the proposed method requires low computational load for the SOC difference and short-circuit resistance diagnosis.

<p>In order to develop the flux dipping process, a quantitative mathematical model that accurately describes the flux dipping process in the flip-chip bonding is proposed. The whole dynamic dipping process is captured by the high-speed transient imaging followed by image processing. Curve fitting of experimental results yields the relation between flux dipping quantity and process parameters. It suggests a quadratic function of quantity ( $Q$) with respect to dipping depth ( $d$), and a piece-wise function to dipping speed ( $v$) including an exponential section and a quadratic or linear section. While the coupled effect of d and v can be expressed as a merged function of $Q= f_{(d,v)}$, these mathematical models are proved to be effective when applied to the actual dipping process practiced on a flip-chip bonding machine, thus providing a reliable mathematical basis for optimizing dipping flux in industrial manufacturing.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A microgrid may comprise several zones with local loads and distributed generation resources. If a fault occurs in a zone, then a static switch between the faulty and fault-free zones must be activated to detect/classify the faults and enable the breaker to open the circuit immediately. This paper presents a new method for designing a detection/classification module in a static switch using the Park Transform (PT), Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) and Takagi&#x2013;Sugeno&#x2013;Kang (TSK) fuzzy rules. Both wavelet coefficients/energies of the d-axis component, within 0.96&#x2013;1.92 kHz, obtained by MRA and PT are employed to effectively detect and classify the fault types using the local fault signals near the static switch without a complicated communication system. The proposed TSK fuzzy rules, defined by the scenario data only, successfully classify the faults. The proposed method is verified by hardware-in-the-loop simulation using a real-time digital simulator and a realistic 5 kVA static switch. The proposed method is implemented in a Xilinx field-programmable gate array. Test results show that the proposed method is efficient in the real-time control environment of a microgrid.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Thermal energy capacity of buildings can be coupled to power networks via heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) units. Optimizing the operation of HVAC systems in multizone buildings is a challenging task, as occupants have different thermal preferences dependent on time-varying indoor and outdoor environments. To estimate the social cost of demand response (DR), building aggregators need to assess occupants&#x2019; thermal discomfort (TD), which is related to their productivity outcomes. This paper proposes a price-based DR strategy for multizone office buildings to co-optimize the energy cost of HVAC units and the TD levels of occupants. To overcome simplified TD representations, a mobile interface is developed that grants occupants the ability to indicate their personal thermal preferences. These preferences are modeled using artificial neural networks, which are explicitly and directly integrated into the optimal DR scheduling. In addition, we evaluate the thermal response of a multizone office building to the operation of a variable speed heat pump (VSHP). Using the models of occupants&#x2019; TD and building thermal response, the optimization problem for the proposed DR strategy is formulated and solved with mixed-integer linear programming. The case study results verify that the proposed strategy successfully optimizes VSHP operations and occupants&#x2019; TD levels, mitigating the risk of occupant interruption to the optimal DR schedule.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Regarding the potentials of activating commercial consumers in demand response programs, this paper proposes a new framework for energy scheduling of an active distribution network based on the concept of technical virtual power plant (TVPP), considering operational constraints of distribution network. The TVPP enables presence of commercial buildings and other distributed energy resources in day-ahead (DA) electricity market, as a price maker agent. In this regard, a bilevel optimization framework is designed to optimize the bidding strategy of TVPP in the DA market with the main goal of maximizing TVPP profit. The upper-level problem maximizes the TVPP profit, while in the lower level, market is cleared from independent system operator viewpoint. Using Karush&#x2014;Kuhn&#x2013;Tucker optimality conditions and strong duality theory, the proposed bilevel problem is transformed into mixed integer linear programming problem. Implementing the model on the Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS) test system demonstrates the applicability of the proposed model.

In this standardized structure, a human model has a center of gravity (COG), while a robot device has a zero moment point (ZMP) with COG as the stability standard in the walking motion. In the gait system of wearable type, the stability of human model is closely related with the robot device, in other words, the COG and ZMP are located in the limited domain of human motion and robot task. In this paper, the human and device are designed individually and the knee joint of human is unconstrained from the device work to allow the human reliance. The stability index that includes the COG and ZMP is defined. The validation of this index is guaranteed through a few tests to describe a correlation between the stability index and the human model condition. Based on the validity of the stability index, the experiment for the walking stabilization is implemented with the ZMP estimation by reaction torque observer.
