<p>We investigate adblocking filters and the extent to which websites and
advertisers react when their content is impacted by these filters. We collected
data daily from the Alexa Top-5000 web sites for 120 days, and from specific
sites that newly appeared in filter lists for 140 days. By evaluating how long
a filter rule triggers on a website, we can gauge how long it remains
effective. We matched websites with both a regular adblocking filter list
(EasyList) and with a specialized filter list that targets anti-adblocking
logic (Nano Defender).
</p>
<p>From our data, we observe that the effectiveness of the EasyList adblocking
filter decays a modest 0.13\% per day, and after around 80 days seems to
stabilize. We found no evidence for any significant decay in effectiveness of
the more specialized, but less widely used, anti-adblocking removal filters.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The ability of a sensor node to determine its location in a sensor network is
important in many applications. The infrastructure for the location-based
services is an easy target for malicious attacks. We address scenarios where
malicious node(s) attempt to disrupt, in an uncoordinated or coordinated
manner, the localization process of a target node. We propose four techniques
for secure localization: weighted least square (WLS), secure weighted least
square (SWLS), and $\ell_1$-norm based techniques LN-1 and LN-1E, in a network
that includes one or more compromised anchor nodes. WLS and SWLS techniques are
shown to offer significant advantage over existing techniques by assigning
larger weights to the anchor nodes that are closer to the target node, and by
detecting the malicious nodes and eliminating their measurements from the
localization process. In a coordinated attack, the localization problem can be
posed as a plane fitting problem where the measurements from non-malicious and
malicious anchor nodes lie on two different planes. LN-1E technique estimates
these two planes and prevents disruption of the localization process. The
Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the position estimate is also derived. The
proposed techniques are shown to provide better localization accuracy than the
existing algorithms.

<p>Identifying new viral threats, and developing long term defences against
current and future computer viruses, requires an understanding of their
behaviour, structure and capabilities. This paper aims to advance this
understanding by further developing the abstract theory of computer viruses. A
method of providing abstract definitions for classes of viruses is presented in
this paper, which addresses inadequacies of previous techniques. Formal
definitions for some classes of viruses are then provided, which correspond to
existing informal definitions. To relate the abstract theory to the real world,
the connection between the abstract definitions and concrete virus
implementations is examined. The use of the proposed method in studying the
fundamental properties of computer viruses is discussed.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://arxiv.org/">cs.CR updates on arXiv.org</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The widespread adoption of Internet of Things has led to many security
issues. Recently, there have been malware attacks on IoT devices, the most
prominent one being that of Mirai. IoT devices such as IP cameras, DVRs and
routers were compromised by the Mirai malware and later large-scale DDoS
attacks were propagated using those infected devices (bots) in October 2016. In
this research, we develop a network-based algorithm which can be used to detect
IoT bots infected by Mirai or similar malware in large-scale networks (e.g. ISP
network). The algorithm particularly targets bots scanning the network for
vulnerable devices since the typical scanning phase for botnets lasts for
months and the bots can be detected much before they are involved in an actual
attack. We analyze the unique signatures of the Mirai malware to identify its
presence in an IoT device. The prospective deployment of our bot detection
solution is discussed next along with the countermeasures which can be taken
post detection. Further, to optimize the usage of computational resources, we
use a two-dimensional (2D) packet sampling approach, wherein we sample the
packets transmitted by IoT devices both across time and across the devices.
Leveraging the Mirai signatures identified and the 2D packet sampling approach,
a bot detection algorithm is proposed. Subsequently, we use testbed
measurements and simulations to study the relationship between bot detection
delays and the sampling frequencies for device packets. Finally, we derive
insights from the obtained results and use them to design our proposed bot
detection algorithm.

<p>Security of machine learning models is a concern as they may face adversarial
attacks for unwarranted advantageous decisions. While research on the topic has
mainly been focusing on the image domain, numerous industrial applications, in
particular in finance, rely on standard tabular data. In this paper, we discuss
the notion of adversarial examples in the tabular domain. We propose a
formalization based on the imperceptibility of attacks in the tabular domain
leading to an approach to generate imperceptible adversarial examples.
Experiments show that we can generate imperceptible adversarial examples with a
high fooling rate.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to different solar radiation, temperature, and other reasons of modules in the three-phase cascaded H-bridge (CHB) photovoltaic (PV) inverter, the output power among PV modules will be unequal and lead to unbalanced grid currents, which cannot meet the requirements of grid codes. On the other hand, the second-order voltage ripple is aroused in the dc-link capacitor since each phase-leg of the CHB inverter is made up of a single-phase inverter. Concerning these two issues, this paper proposes an optimized third harmonic injection method based on fundamental frequency zero sequence injection (FFZSI), which is a conventional method to handle the slight power imbalance problem. In this paper, the FFZSI is adopted to redistribute the power among three phases, and then the third harmonic is injected into the three-phase combined reference waveforms according to the two requirements: all modules are free from overmodulation and the dc-link voltage fluctuation is mostly reduced. Therefore, the proposed method can reduce the dc-link voltage fluctuation and extend the power balance range of FFZSI at the same time. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by simulation and experimental results.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>For high-speed permanent magnet machines (HSPMMs), the permanent magnet (PM) is more likely to suffer irreversible demagnetization because the heat dissipation is serious in the HSPMMs, especially for the high-power machines. This paper focuses on the comprehensive research results on the power loss and thermal characteristic for a high-power HSPMM. First, the power loss at the rated load is investigated by finite-element analysis. Then, the temperature distribution of four cooling schemes is compared by the electromagnetic-thermal iteration calculation. The effect of different parameters on thermal behavior is obtained to reduce rotor temperature, which includes an examination of the axial flow duct, cooling medium, sleeve thickness, and sleeve thermal conductivity. Finally, an improved loss separation method is employed to obtain the loss distribution from the measured total loss, and the comprehensive experiments are implemented based on one HSPMM prototype (800 kW, 15 000 rpm) to verify the related theoretical analysis.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The fast detection of magnitude, frequency, and phase angle of the fundamental-frequency component is very useful in many three-phase power system applications. Most techniques to accomplish this task are based on different versions of three-phase phase-locked loop (PLL) schemes. Some variables of three-phase systems may experience phase angle jumps after some disturbances. In this paper, a method for the fast detection of phase angle jump occurrence, estimation of the phase angle jump, and its use for improving the performance of the generalized delayed signal cancelation (GDSC) PLL is proposed. The proposed method is based on the detailed evaluation of the GDSC filter transient behavior after a phase jump. Results considering typical three-phase grid disturbances are used to evaluate the proposed scheme, in comparison with other usual PLL techniques. The use of the proposed phase jump angle estimator allowed a reduction in the GDSC-PLL convergence time of about 50&#x0025;.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Time delay control (TDC) is a promising technique for robot manipulators because it is model-free, efficient, and yet, robust. Nevertheless, when a robot operates under significant payload changes, it is difficult to achieve satisfactory performance with a constant gain. To cope with this problem, several adaptive rules have already been proposed thus far, but they are less effective to significant payload changes, and parameter tuning procedures are too complicated. In this paper, we propose an adaptive gain dynamics that is more effective in payload changes and yet simpler to implement. Through simulations using a one-link arm and experiments using a whole arm manipulator with payload changes, the proposed dynamics was compared with the conventional TDC and two other existing methods. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can adapt to significant payload changes, achieving better accuracy than the conventional TDC. Experimental results show that the proposed method has consistently better adaptation capability than other methods, achieving significantly better accuracy. In addition, the proposed method is simpler to implement, having only one tuning parameter, whereas the existing methods require four or five such tuning parameters.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper aims to propose a quantitative tuning method for active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) that controls the K&#x002f;(Ts &#x002b; 1)<sup>n</sup>-type high-order processes. An asymptote in the Nyquist curve has been observed for the first time and its mathematical expression has been deduced. An asymptote condition is provided in order to derive a parameter tuning rule under the sensitivity constraint. Although this proposed tuning rule is originally designed for a certain type of high-order processes, it can be extended to other types processes that can be approximated into the form of K&#x002f;(Ts &#x002b; 1)<sup>n</sup>. Comparisons with different PID control strategies have been conducted for a range of cases to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed tuning method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed tuning rule is experimentally verified on water tank system that exhibits high-order dynamics. Field tests on the superheater steam temperature control of a circulating fluidized bed power plant further demonstrate its potential for applications in complex industrial processes.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Deep neural network (DNN) extracts hierarchical representations from process data and is promising for nonlinear process monitoring. Obtaining meaningful representations and generating efficient fault detection residual are the main challenges in DNN-based monitoring. This study proposes a regularized deep correlated representation (RDCR) method that incorporates deep belief networks (DBNs) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for nonlinear process monitoring. Hierarchical representations are initially extracted using DBN to process input and output variables. Second, hierarchical representations from process input and output are modeled through CCA to characterize the relationship between them. Efficient fault detection residuals are then generated, and monitoring statistics are established. CCA-based monitoring relies on the most correlated representations; thus, a multiobjective evolutionary optimization-based regularization is performed to select the most correlated representations and eliminate the influence of unrelated representations. The advantages of the RDCR monitoring are verified through experimental studies on a numerical example and the Tennessee Eastman process.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The variety of arc fault induced by different load types makes residential series arc fault detection complicated and challengeable. This paper proposes a hybrid time and frequency analysis and fully connected neural network (HTFNN) based method to identify series ac arc fault. The HTFNN method recognizes samples state by broadly classifying them into resistive (Re) category, capacitive&#x2013;inductive (CI) category, and switching (Sw) category according to the fundamental frequency components of series current. In each category, separate fully connected neural network (NN) with customized time and frequency indicators being the input is employed for fine class recognition and state identification. This method construction addresses the feature overlap among various cases by separate categories and enables suitable indicator selection within each category. Since the identification complexity in each category is cheaper than identifying all cases together, concise NNs are applied in this paper to reduce computing cost. The general accuracies of normal and arcing state identification in Re, CI, and Sw category are 99.64&#x0025;, 100&#x0025;, and 98.45&#x0025;, respectively, based on 3950 test samples. Method comparison shows that HTFNN achieves higher detection precision at lower computational complexity for generalized load types. This paper also evaluates the feasibility of implementing the method in hardware for arc fault detection device application.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to the inherent intermittent nature of renewable energy sources (RES), the control and management of microgrids become complex and require modern control techniques and management strategies to cope up with the changes in the dynamics of the system. This paper focuses on improving the dynamic performance of a microgrid by developing different energy management and control strategies employing a four-layer multiagent concept. The first layer of the proposed system is a forecasting and estimation layer and is responsible for providing the real-time forecasts for RES output power, load, and battery state of charge. The second layer is a control and action layer, assigned with the duties of taking the control decisions and actions accordingly by collecting information from different agents deployed in the system. The third layer is a real-time monitoring and control layer that provides the real-time information of the microgrid to the second layer. The fourth layer is a fault detection and action layer that facilitates the self-healing capability in the proposed microgrid. The performance and the applicability of the proposed model is tested by simulating the faults at different locations in the system.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Nowadays, production-oriented manufacturing is transforming to service-oriented one, which leads to an increasing demand for high reliability of manufacturing systems. However, a popular approach to measuring terminal reliability of complex networked systems is based on graph theory, which has been shown to be an NP-hard problem. Though the NP-hard problem can be avoided by employing a statistical measure method for terminal reliability of random networks based on percolation theory, there is still lack of a general assessment approach to calculating terminal reliability of heterogeneous complex networks in intelligent manufacturing. In this paper, we propose a novel fractal-based approach to measuring the terminal reliability of heterogeneous networks. With help of the renormalization procedure that coarse grains a network into boxes containing nodes within given lateral size and inverse renormalization, which gives a fractal network growth model, a fractal network approximation of an arbitrary complex network is obtained. This fractal network topology can be described by a superposition of fractal elements based on fractal theory. Following this description, terminal reliability is the function of reliability of fractal elements. Then, a reliability assessment algorithm with computational complexity $O(N^2)$ based on fractal elements is developed. Numerical simulation is performed on a real network and a fractal network to validate the effectiveness of our method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>For cyber-physical industrial networks,&#x00a0;more and more multimedia data is faced in high-speed information transmission. The explosive data brings more challenges to the architecture of modern industrial networks. In this way, cache resource allocation technology is necessary for practical applications.&#x00a0;In order to design reasonable caching framework, how to predict the multimedia data request is an important issue. In order to keep efficient and reliable data transmission in wireless industrial networks, security design is also critical for existing cache resource allocation. Based on previous works, some promising technologies have been applied, such as heterogeneous ultradense networks, wireless edge caching, and web content popularity prediction. In this paper, we summarize these promising technologies and provide a useful guidance for security design in cyber-physical cache resource allocation system. Specially, we can divide the proposed method into three main steps. First of all, a spatio-temporal multimedia content prediction based on long short-term memory is proposed for accurate prediction on multimedia data request. After that, we make use of Zipf fitting for caching model. At last, the caching optimization considering security is put forward in this paper. Experimental results show the satisfied performance of our proposed algorithm and it has obvious potential application value in cyber-physical industrial networks with cache resource allocation technology.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Recent development of object detection mainly depends on deep learning with large-scale benchmarks. However, collecting such fully-annotated data is often difficult or expensive for real-world applications, which restricts the power of deep neural networks in practice. Alternatively, humans can detect new objects with little annotation burden, since humans often use the prior knowledge to identify new objects with few elaborately-annotated examples, and subsequently generalize this capacity by exploiting objects from wild images. Inspired by this procedure of learning to detect, we propose a novel Progressive Object Transfer Detection (POTD) framework. Specifically, we make three main contributions in this paper. First, POTD can leverage various object supervision of different domains effectively into a progressive detection procedure. Via such human-like learning, one can boost a target detection task with few annotations. Second, POTD consists of two delicate transfer stages, i.e., Low-Shot Transfer Detection (LSTD), and Weakly-Supervised Transfer Detection (WSTD). In LSTD, we distill the implicit object knowledge of source detector to enhance target detector with few annotations. It can effectively warm up WSTD later on. In WSTD, we design a recurrent object labelling mechanism for learning to annotate weakly-labeled images. More importantly, we exploit the reliable object supervision from LSTD, which can further enhance the robustness of target detector in the WSTD stage. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on a number of challenging detection benchmarks with different settings. The results demonstrate that, our POTD outperforms the recent state-of-the-art approaches. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/Cassie94/LSTD/tree/lstd.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Massive MIMO attains high spectral and power efficiency transmission by leveraging a large number of transmit antennas. However, to capture the benefits of massive MIMO, each antenna should be accompanied with a dedicated RF chain, and consequently, the hardware costs would scale up tremendously with the increase of the antennas. Cheap implementations of massive MIMO have recently gained considerable attention, and constant modulus (CM) signaling is seen as a promising solution, owing to its low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). This paper investigates the physical-layer (PHY) security in massive MIMO with an emphasis on the CM signaling. In particular, we consider a transmitter with massive antennas broadcast common confidential information to a group of legitimate receivers, and a number of eavesdroppers overhear the transmission and attempt to intercept the information. Our goal is to design the CM beamforming at the transmitter so that the multicast secrecy rate is maximized. This secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is generally NP-hard. To tackle it, two tractable approaches are developed. The first one employs the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique and the Charnes-Copper transformation to obtain a convex relaxation of the SRM problem. However, due to the dimension lifting of SDR, this approach is feasible only for small to medium antenna sizes. The second approach leverages the Dinkelbach method to work directly over the beamformer domain; a custom-build nonconvex alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed to efficiently perform each Dinkelbach update. Simulation results demonstrate that the second approach is computationally more efficient and can achieve nearly optimal performance when the number of antennas is large.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>With the prevalence of smartphones, mobile websites have been more and more popular. However, many mobile websites collect the location information which greatly increases users' risks of being tracked unexpectedly. The current location access control setting is not sufficient since it cannot prevent the service providers which have been granted location-access permissions from tracking the users. In this paper, we propose a novel location privacy preservation mobile app, called MoveWithMe, which automatically generates decoy queries to hide the real users' locations and intentions when they are using location-based mobile services. Unlike the existing works on dummy trajectories which may be easily discovered by attackers through data analysis, the uniqueness of the MoveWithMe app is that our generated decoys closely behave like real humans. Each decoy in our system has its own moving patterns, daily schedules, and social behaviors, which ensures its movements to be semantically different from the real user's trace and satisfying geographic constraints. Thus, our decoys can hardly be distinguished even by advanced data mining techniques. Another advantage of the MoveWithMe app is that it guarantees the same level of user experience without affecting the response time or introducing extra control burdens. Decoys move independently in the back end and automatically submit queries to the same service provider whenever the user does so. Our proposed MoveWithMe app has both iOS and Android versions and has been tested on different brands of smartphones against various location-based services, such as Yelp and TripAdvisor. Experimental results demonstrate its practicality, effectiveness, and efficiency.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate. Although there exist methods to deal with subjective ratings, whether subjectivity influences the effect of unfair rating attacks was an open question. We discover that subjectivity decreases the robustness against attacks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper studies the optimal tradeoff between secrecy and non-secrecy rates of the MISO wiretap channels for different power constraint settings: sum power constraint only, per-antenna power constraints only, and joint sum and per-antenna power constraints. The problem is motivated by the fact that channel capacity and secrecy capacity are generally achieved by different transmit strategies. First, a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure a positive secrecy capacity is shown. The optimal tradeoff between secrecy rate and transmission rate is characterized by a weighted rate sum maximization problem. Since this problem is not necessarily convex, equivalent problem formulations are introduced to derive the optimal transmit strategies. Under sum power constraint only, a closed-form solution is provided. Under per-antenna power constraints, necessary conditions to find the optimal power allocation are derived. Sufficient conditions are provided for the special case of two transmit antennas. For the special case of aligned channels, the optimal transmit strategies can deduced from an equivalent point-to-point channel problem. Last, the theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Anomaly detection is an important technique used to identify patterns of unusual network behavior and keep the network under control. Today, network attacks are increasing in terms of both their number and sophistication. To avoid causing significant traffic patterns and being detected by existing techniques, many new attacks tend to involve gradual adjustment of behaviors, which always generate incomplete sessions due to their running mechanisms. Accordingly, in this work, we employ the behavior symmetry degree to profile the anomalies and further identify unusual behaviors. We first proposed a symmetry degree to identify the incomplete sessions generated by unusual behaviors; we then employ a sketch to calculate the symmetry degree of internal hosts to improve the identification efficiency for online applications. To reduce the memory cost and probability of collision, we divide the IP addresses into four segments that can be used as keys of the hash functions in the sketch. Moreover, to further improve detection accuracy, a threshold selection method is proposed for dynamic traffic pattern analysis. The hash functions in the sketch are then designed using Chinese remainder theory, which can analytically trace the IP addresses associated with the anomalies. We tested the proposed techniques based on traffic data collected from the northwest center of CERNET (China Education and Research Network); the results show that the proposed methods can effectively detect anomalies in large-scale networks.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Collective activity recognition, which tells what activity a group of people is performing, is a cutting-edge research topic in computer vision. Different from action performed by individuals, collective activity needs to consider the complex interactions among different people. However, most previous works require exhaustive annotations such as accurate label information of individual actions, pairwise interactions, and poses, which could not be easily available in practice. Moreover, most of them treat human detection as a decoupled task before collective activity recognition and leverage all detected persons. This not only ignores the mutual relation between the two tasks, which makes it hard for filtering out irrelevant people, but also probably increases the computation burden when reasoning the collective activities. In this paper, we propose a fast weakly supervised deep learning architecture for collective activity recognition. For fast inference, we propose to make the actor detection and weakly supervised collective activity reasoning collaborate in an end-to-end framework by sharing convolutional layers between them. The joint learning makes the two tasks united and reinforced each other, so that it is more effective to filter out the outliers who are not involved in the activity. For the weakly supervised learning, we propose a latent embedding scheme for mining person-group interactive relationship to get rid of the use of any pairwise relation between people and the individual action labels as well. The experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves comparable or even better performance as compared to the state-of-the-art on three datasets. Our joint modelling reasons collective activities at the speed of 22.65 fps, which is the fastest ever known and substantially makes collective activity recognition more towards real-time applications.

<p>Image restoration (IR) is a long-standing challenging problem in low-level image processing. It is of utmost importance to learn good image priors for pursuing visually pleasing results. In this paper, we develop a multi-channel and multi-model-based denoising autoencoder network as image prior for solving IR problem. Specifically, the network that trained on RGB-channel images is used to construct a prior at first, and then the learned prior is incorporated into single-channel grayscale IR tasks. To achieve the goal, we employ the auxiliary variable technique to integrate the higher-dimensional network-driven prior information into the iterative restoration procedure. In addition, according to the weighted aggregation idea, a multi-model strategy is put forward to enhance the network stability that favors to avoid getting trapped in local optima. Extensive experiments on image deblurring and deblocking tasks show that the proposed algorithm is efficient, robust, and yields state-of-the-art restoration quality on grayscale images.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Point cloud-based immersive media representation format has provided many opportunities for extended reality applications and has become widely used in volumetric content capturing scenarios. The high data rate of the point cloud is one of the key problems preventing the adoption of this media format. MPEG Immersive media working group (MPEG-I) aims to create a point cloud compression methodology relying on the existing video coding hardware implementations to solve this problem. However, in the scope of the state-of-the-art video-based dynamic point cloud compression (V-PCC) standard under MPEG-I, the intrinsic 3D object's motion continuity is destroyed by the 2D projections, resulting in a significant loss of inter prediction coding efficiency. In this paper, we first propose a general model utilizing the 3D motion and 3D to 2D correspondence to calculate the 2D motion vector (MV). Then, under the V-PCC, we propose a geometry-based method using the accurate 3D reconstructed geometry from the 2D geometry video to estimate the 2D MV in the 2D attribute video. In addition, we propose an auxiliary-information-based method using the coarse 3D reconstructed geometry provided by the auxiliary information to estimate the 2D MV in both the 2D geometry and attribute videos. Furthermore, we provide the following two ways to use the estimated 2D MV to improve coding efficiency. The first one is normative. We propose adding the estimated MV into the advanced MV candidate list and find a better MV predictor for each prediction unit (PU). The second one is non-normative. We propose applying the estimated MV as an additional candidate of the centers for motion estimation. We implement the proposed algorithms in the V-PCC reference software. Experimental results show that the proposed methods present significant coding gains compared with the current state-of-the-art motion prediction algorithm.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel deep sparse coding network (SCN) capable of efficiently adapting its own regularization parameters for a given application. The network is trained end-to-end with a supervised task-driven learning algorithm via error backpropagation. During training, the network learns both the dictionaries and the regularization parameters of each sparse coding layer so that the reconstructive dictionaries are smoothly transformed into increasingly discriminative representations. In addition, the adaptive regularization also offers the network more flexibility to adjust sparsity levels. Furthermore, we have devised a sparse coding layer utilizing a &#x201c;skinny&#x201d; dictionary. Integral to computational efficiency, these skinny dictionaries compress the high-dimensional sparse codes into lower dimensional structures. The adaptivity and discriminability of our 15-layer SCN are demonstrated on six benchmark datasets, namely Cifar-10, Cifar-100, STL-10, SVHN, MNIST, and ImageNet, most of which are considered difficult for sparse coding models. Experimental results show that our architecture overwhelmingly outperforms traditional one-layer sparse coding architectures while using much fewer parameters. Moreover, our multilayer architecture exploits the benefits of depth with sparse coding's characteristic ability to operate on smaller datasets. In such data-constrained scenarios, our technique demonstrates a highly competitive performance compared with the deep neural networks.
