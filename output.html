<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we first proposed a novel hybrid loop array (HLA) for low leakage electromagnetic field (EMF) level and high efficiency in a wireless high power transfer system. The proposed HLA effectively enhances the system efficiency and shields leakage EMF in a wireless power transfer (WPT) system using kHz range resonant frequency. The key originality of the proposed HLA is the combination of two types of loop coil; shielding loop coil (SLC) and amplifying loop coil (ALC). SLCs reduce leakage EMF, and ALCs significantly enhance the magnetic field from a Tx coil. The simulation and experiment results show that the proposed solution successfully overcomes the limitations of the existing solutions. Analytical modeling and design procedure are introduced and discussed. In addition, the experimental verification of the simulation result is included. We first designed and modeled an HLA considering the coupling effect of neighboring loop coils to evaluate its efficiency and leakage EMF. With the proposed HLA, we demonstrated a 9.36&#x0025; improvement in the efficiency and 3&#x00a0;dBm reduction in the leakage EMF near the WPT system.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A nonisolated bidirectional dc&#x2013;dc converter with high voltage gain, low voltage stress, low component count, and soft-switching features is presented in this paper. In this topology, coupled inductors and voltage multiplier cells are merged to achieve high step-up&#x002f;down voltage gain. Also, due to using active clamp circuits, the voltage stress of power switches is relatively low. Thus, the low voltage switches with low on-resistance can be employed to reduce the conduction losses. Furthermore, zero-voltage switching is accomplished in both high step-up and high step-down modes for all power switches, and due to zero-current switching operation of all antiparallel diodes, the reverse recovery losses are reduced. In order to verify the theoretical analysis and the converter performance, a 200 W prototype circuit of the proposed converter is implemented in the laboratory.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The dc microgrid (MG) system has several advantages over the ac one. Therefore, it recently became a preferred architecture in numerous industrial applications. Many loads in dc MGs are electronically regulated and they challenge the stability of the system due to their constant power load (CPL) behavior. This letter proposes a systematic and simple approach to design an improved state feedback controller for the power buffer that can stabilize the dc MGs with multiple CPLs. Based on the so-called sector nonlinearity approach, the nonlinear dc MG with several CPLs is exactly represented in a Takagi&#x2013;Sugeno fuzzy model. Then, by employing the quadratic D-stability theory, the sufficient conditions to guarantee the stability and transient performance of the closed-loop system are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), such that the decay rate and oscillatory behavior of the closed-loop dc MG system are guaranteed to lie inside a predefined region. The LMI conditions can be numerically solved by utilizing the YALMIP toolbox in the MATLAB. Finally, to illustrate the merits and implementation validity of the proposed approach, some hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulation (RTS) results on a dc MG, which feeds two CPLs, are presented. In comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques, the RTS results indicate the simplicity, validity, and better performance of the proposed approach. According to the results, one can conclude that the proposed approach not only theoretically assures the stability but also guarantees the fast convergence and less oscillatory response of the dc MGs with multiple CPLs.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) system encodes the 3D hyperspectral image (HSI) within a single 2D compressive image and then reconstructs the underlying HSI by employing an inverse optimization algorithm, which equips with the distinct advantage of snapshot but usually results in low reconstruction accuracy. To improve the accuracy, existing methods attempt to design either alternative coded apertures or advanced reconstruction methods, but cannot connect these two aspects via a unified framework, which limits the accuracy improvement. In this paper, we propose a convolution neural network-based end-to-end method to boost the accuracy by jointly optimizing the coded aperture and the reconstruction method. On the one hand, based on the nature of CASSI forward model, we design a repeated pattern for the coded aperture, whose entities are learned by acting as the network weights. On the other hand, we conduct the reconstruction through simultaneously exploiting intrinsic properties within HSI&#x2014;the extensive correlations across the spatial and spectral dimensions. By leveraging the power of deep learning, the coded aperture design and the image reconstruction are connected and optimized via a unified framework. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under both comprehensive quantitative metrics and perceptive quality.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Video stabilization techniques are essential for most hand-held captured videos due to high-frequency shakes. Several 2D-, 2.5D-, and 3D-based stabilization techniques have been presented previously, but to the best of our knowledge, no solutions based on deep neural networks had been proposed to date. The main reason for this omission is shortage in training data as well as the challenge of modeling the problem using neural networks. In this paper, we present a video stabilization technique using a convolutional neural network. Previous works usually propose an off-line algorithm that smoothes a holistic camera path based on feature matching. Instead, we focus on low-latency, real-time camera path smoothing that does not explicitly represent the camera path and does not use future frames. Our neural network model, called StabNet, learns a set of mesh-grid transformations progressively for each input frame from the previous set of stabilized camera frames and creates stable corresponding latent camera paths implicitly. To train the network, we collect a dataset of synchronized steady and unsteady video pairs via a specially designed hand-held hardware. Experimental results show that our proposed online method performs comparatively to the traditional off-line video stabilization methods without using future frames while running about 10 times faster. More importantly, our proposed StabNet is able to handle low-quality videos, such as night-scene videos, watermarked videos, blurry videos, and noisy videos, where the existing methods fail in feature extraction or matching.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Using multi-atlas registration (MAR), information carried by atlases can be transferred onto a new input image for the tasks of region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation, anatomical landmark detection, and so on. Conventional atlases used in MAR methods are monomodal and contain only normal anatomical structures. Therefore, the majority of MAR methods cannot handle input multimodal pathological images, which are often collected in routine image-based diagnosis. This is because registering monomodal atlases with normal appearances to multimodal pathological images involves two major problems: 1) missing imaging modalities in the monomodal atlases and 2) influence from pathological regions. In this paper, we propose a new MAR framework to tackle these problems. In this framework, deep learning-based image synthesizers are applied for synthesizing multimodal normal atlases from conventional monomodal normal atlases. To reduce the influence from pathological regions, we further propose a multimodal low-rank approach to recover multimodal normal-looking images from multimodal pathological images. Finally, the multimodal normal atlases can be registered to the recovered multimodal images in a multi-channel way. We evaluate our MAR framework via brain ROI segmentation of multimodal tumor brain images. Due to the utilization of multimodal information and the reduced influence from pathological regions, experimental results show that registration based on our method is more accurate and robust, leading to significantly improved brain ROI segmentation compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Stereoscopic saliency detection plays an important role in various stereoscopic video processing applications. However, conventional stereoscopic video saliency detection methods mainly use independent low-level features instead of extracting them automatically, and thus, they ignore the intrinsic relationship between the spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel stereoscopic video saliency detection method based on 3D convolutional neural networks, namely, deep 3D video saliency (Deep3DSaliency). The proposed network consists of two sub-models: spatiotemporal saliency model (STSM) and stereoscopic saliency aware model (SSAM). STSM directly takes three consecutive video frames as the input to extract visual spatiotemporal features, while SSAM attempts to further infer the depth and semantic features from the left and right video frames by shared parameters from STSM. The visual spatiotemporal features from STSM and the depth and semantic features from SSAM are learned by an alternating optimization scheme. Finally, all these saliency-related features are combined together for the final stereoscopic saliency detection via 3D deconvolution. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed model over other existing ones in saliency estimation for 3D video sequences.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Light field (LF) photography is an emerging paradigm for capturing more immersive representations of the real world. However, arising from the inherent tradeoff between the angular and spatial dimensions, the spatial resolution of LF images captured by commercial micro-lens-based LF cameras is significantly constrained. In this paper, we propose effective and efficient end-to-end convolutional neural network models for spatially super-resolving LF images. Specifically, the proposed models have an hourglass shape, which allows feature extraction to be performed at the low-resolution level to save both the computational and memory costs. To fully make use of the 4D structure information of LF data in both the spatial and angular domains, we propose to use 4D convolution to characterize the relationship among pixels. Moreover, as an approximation of 4D convolution, we also propose to use spatial-angular separable (SAS) convolutions for more computationally and memory-efficient extraction of spatial-angular joint features. Extensive experimental results on 57 test LF images with various challenging natural scenes show significant advantages from the proposed models over the state-of-the-art methods. That is, an average PSNR gain of more than 3.0 dB and better visual quality are achieved, and our methods preserve the LF structure of the super-resolved LF images better, which is highly desirable for subsequent applications. In addition, the SAS convolution-based model can achieve three times speed up with only negligible reconstruction quality decrease when compared with the 4D convolution-based one. The source code of our method is available online.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p><span class="paragraphSection"><strong>To the Editor</strong> Dr Psaty and colleagues compared precision medicine and preventive medicine as 2 distinct models in medicine. They posited that precision medicine is deterministic, often with a gene-centric approach, while preventive medicine is probabilistic and applies to common conditions such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The 2 models are complementary and not competitive. Emerging scientific evidence will guide physicians toward preventive and curative interventions that can work best at the population or individual levels. As envisioned by the All of Us research program, precision medicine encompasses both treatment and prevention and is more than genetics: &#8220;Precision medicine takes into account individual differences in lifestyle, environment, and biology.&#8221; Furthermore, precision does not necessarily imply biologic determinism. Most human diseases are due to complex gene-environment interactions that can lead only to probabilistic approaches to prevention.</span>

We fully recognize that we are in the presence of a great social upheaval whose effect throughout the world will probably surpass even that momentous event known as the French Revolution. We can see only dimly whither we are tending, but it is at least evident that civilization is moving rapidly, whether down a steep place into the sea or, as some believe, up into the heights of the Promised Land. In this movement the medical profession is to a degree caught in the sweep of forces beyond its control, but it is also to a large extent potent and responsible for the part it shall play in the new era dawning on us. Many individual physicians have been more or less completely, if temporarily, uprooted by mobilization for war, and the whole medical profession, like many other professions, has been jostled out of its stability and routine. It is a time to many for strenuous readjustment; it is also an unequaled opportunity for surveying the future of medicine and formulating plans for a rational development. One thing is certain: that no limited considerations of self interest are going to satisfy either the bulk of medical practitioners or the public they serve. The practice of medicine will more than ever be regarded not merely as a means of earning a livelihood but as an essential service to mankind.</span>

<p>The thermal camera can capture keyboard surface temperature change after a human&#x2019;s touch. This phenomenon may be used to steal users&#x2019; passwords physically. In this paper, based on the study of thermal dynamics of keyboards, we design a password break system using an infrared thermal camera. First, we build a signal model to describe the dynamic process of temperature change on the keyboard using Newton&#x2019;s law of cooling. Next, we develop a maximum likelihood parameter estimation algorithm to estimate the keystroke time instants. Then, by maximizing the probability of key order arrangement, a novel password breaking algorithm is developed. Our algorithm is tested using simulated data as well as real-world data. Experiment results show that our algorithm is effective for physical password breaking using thermal characteristics. Based on our results, we discuss strategies for password protection at the end.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The forensic investigation of JPEG compression generally relies on the analysis of first-order statistics based on image histogram. The JPEG compression detection methods based on such methodology can be effortlessly circumvented by adopting some anti-forensic attacks. This paper presents a counter JPEG anti-forensic method by considering the second-order statistical analysis based on the co-occurrence matrices (CMs). The proposed framework comprises three stages: selection of the target difference image, evaluation of CMs, and generation of second-order statistical feature based on CMs. In the first stage, we explore the effects of dithering operation of JPEG anti-forensics by analyzing the variance inconsistencies along the diagonals. Afterward, CMs are evaluated in the second stage to highlight the effects of grainy noise introduced during the dithering operation. The third stage is devoted to generate an optimal second-order statistical feature which is fed to the SVM classifier. The experimental results based on the uncompressed color image database and BOSSBase dataset images demonstrated that the proposed forensic detector based on CM is very efficient even in the presence of anti-forensic attacks. Moreover, the experimental results also confirm the competency of the proposed method in counter median filtering and contrast enhancement anti-forensics. The proposed scheme also provides satisfactory results in detecting other image processing operations such as mean filtering, Gaussian filtering, Weiner filtering, scaling, and rotation, thereby revealing its multi-purpose nature.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We study deterministic approximations of the Gaussian two-user multiple access wiretap channel (G-MAC-WT) and the Gaussian wiretap channel with a helper (G-WT-H). These approximations enable results beyond the recently shown 2/3 and 1/2 secure degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) for the G-MAC-WT and the G-WT-H, respectively. While the s.d.o.f. were obtained by real interference alignment, our approach uses signal-scale alignment. We show achievable schemes which are independent of the rationality of the channel gains. Moreover, our results can differentiate between channel strengths, in particular, between both users, and will establish secrecy rates dependent on this difference. We can show that the resulting achievable secrecy rates tend to the s.d.o.f. for vanishing channel gain differences. Moreover, we extend previous and develop new techniques to prove generalized s.d.o.f. bounds for varying channel strengths and show that our achievable schemes reach the bounds for certain channel gain parameters. We believe that our analysis is the next step toward a constant-gap analysis of the G-MAC-WT and the G-WT-H.

<p>Multiple user active authentications, in contrast with the single user active authentication, require the verification of identity of multiple subjects. Both traditional verification and identification-based solutions fail to address the specific challenges presented in this problem. We introduce Extremal Openset Rejection, a two-fold mechanism with a sparse representation-based identification step and a verification step for this purpose. In the verification step, concentration of the sparsity vector and the overlap between matched and non-matched distributions are considered for decision making. We introduce a semi-parametric model based on Extreme Value Theory for modeling the distributions, and an algorithm to estimate the parameters of extreme value distributions. Effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using three publicly available face-based mobile active authentication data sets.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>We consider a single-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system in which a base station (BS) with a large number of antennas transmits simultaneously to several single-antenna users. The BS acquires the channel state information (CSI) for various receivers using uplink pilot transmissions. We demonstrate the vulnerability of the CSI estimation process to pilot-contamination (PC) attacks. In our attack model, the attacker aims at minimizing the sum rate of downlink transmissions by contaminating the uplink pilots. We first study these attacks for two downlink power allocation strategies under the assumption that the attacker knows the locations of the BS and its users. Later on, we relax this assumption and consider the case when such knowledge is probabilistic. The formulated problems are solved using stochastic optimization, Lagrangian minimization, and game-theoretic methods. A closed-form solution for a special case of the problem is obtained. Furthermore, we analyze the achievable individual secrecy rates under PC attacks and provide an upper bound on these rates. We also study this scenario without a priori knowledge of user locations at the attacker by introducing chance constraints. Our results indicate that such attacks can degrade the throughput of a massive MIMO system by more than 50&#x0025;.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Common fall occurrences in the elderly population pose dramatic challenges in public healthcare domain. Adoption of an efficient and yet highly reliable automatic fall detection system may not only mitigate the adverse effects of falls through immediate medical assistance, but also profoundly improve the functional ability and confidence level of elder people. This paper presents a pervasive fall detection system developed on smart phones, namely, FallDroid that exploits a two-step algorithm proposed to monitor and detect fall events using the embedded accelerometer signals. Comprising of the threshold-based method and multiple kernel learning support vector machine, the proposed algorithm uses novel techniques to effectively identify fall-like events (such as lying on a bed or sudden stop after running) and reduce false alarms. In addition to user convenience and low power consumption, experimental results reveal that the system detects falls with high accuracy ($97.8%$ and $91.7%$), sensitivity ($99.5%$ and $95.8%$), and specificity ($95.2%$ and $88.0%$) when placed around the waist and thigh, respectively. The system also achieves the lowest false alarm rate of 1 alarm per 59 h of usage, which is best till date.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, the problem of switched networked control systems (SNCSs) with external disturbance and actuator &#x002f;sensor faults is investigated. Meanwhile, the communication constraints such as network-induced delay, packet dropouts, and packet disorder are considered in a communication network. A robust adaptive sliding mode control method is proposed for disturbance damping and faults tolerance, which is designed on an observer and second-order discrete-time adaptive sliding mode function. Furthermore, the reachability of sliding motion is proved. Then, the networked predictive control method is employed to compensate the communication constraints. Finally, the stability of the closed-loop system is proved, and a numerical example and a mechanical system simulation example are executed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Extracting electric vehicle (EV) charging loads is an important aspect that enables smart grid operators to make informed and intelligent decisions about conserving power and promoting the reliability of the electrical grid. This paper presents an unsupervised algorithm to extract the EV charging loads (EVCLs) nonintrusively from the smart meter data. The proposed algorithm can run on low-frequency smart meter sampling data and only requires the real power measurement, which is the type of data communicated and recorded by most smart meters. Validation results on real aggregated household loads have shown that the proposed approach is a promising solution to extract EVCLs and that the approach can effectively mitigate the interference of other appliances that have similar load behaviors as EVs. Furthermore, the extraction of such load behaviors can be aggregated and open further smart grid analyses and studies.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>One of the major obstacles facing the large-scale integration of renewable energy sources to existing power networks is the large magnitude of fluctuations and uncertainties introduced to aggregated demand profiles. Such variations make the supply&#x2013;demand matching a more challenging task, and increase the operational cost of the power system. In this paper, we provide an effective, yet simple, methodology for smoothing power variations using the demand response of a large number of residential appliances. We first present a demand aggregation model based on queueing theory that can accommodate both deferrable and thermostatically controlled loads. Second, controllable demands are scheduled using an online algorithm to smooth the net noncontrollable demand profile. The performance of our methodology is evaluated using realistic data.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper addresses a decentralized leader&#x2013;follower formation control problem for a group of fully actuated unmanned surface vehicles with prescribed performance and collision avoidance. The vehicles are subject to time-varying external disturbances, and the vehicle dynamics include both parametric uncertainties and uncertain nonlinear functions. The control objective is to make each vehicle follow its reference trajectory and avoid collision between each vehicle and its leader. We consider prescribed performance constraints, including transient and steady-state performance constraints, on formation tracking errors. In the kinematic design, we introduce the dynamic surface control technique to avoid the use of vehicle&#x0027;s acceleration. To compensate for the uncertainties and disturbances, we apply an adaptive control technique to estimate the uncertain parameters including the upper bounds of the disturbances and present neural network approximators to estimate uncertain nonlinear dynamics. Consequently, we design a decentralized adaptive formation controller that ensures uniformly ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system with prescribed performance and avoids collision between each vehicle and its leader. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the decentralized formation controller.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>High step-up converters are required for distributed photovoltaic generation systems, due to the low voltage of the photovoltaic source. In this paper, a new hybrid high voltage gain dc&#x2013;dc converter is created by merging the standard boost converter with a coupled inductor and different switched-capacitor techniques. With a single switch and no requirement of higher duty cycle values, the proposed converter achieves a high voltage gain and high efficiency, in addition to lowered voltage and current stresses of the components. A 200-W prototype was implemented experimentally to evaluate the converter, which reached a maximum efficiency of 97.6&#x0025;.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>The employment of solar microconverter allows a more detailed monitoring of the photovoltaic (PV) output power at the single module level; thus, machine learning techniques are capable to track the peculiarities of modules in the PV plants, such as regular shadings. In this way, it is possible to compare in real time the day-ahead forecast power with the actual one in order to better evaluate faults or anomalous trends that might have occurred in the PV plant. This paper presents a method for an effective fault diagnosis; this method is based on the day-ahead forecast of the output power from an existing PV module, linked to a microconverter, and on the outcome of the neighbor PV modules. Finally, this paper also proposes the analysis of the most common error definitions with new mathematical formulations, by comparing their effectiveness and immediate comprehension, in view of increasing power forecasting accuracy and performing both real-time and offline analysis of PV modules performance and possible faults.
