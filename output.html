<p>The COAST-V study published by D&#233;sir&#233;e van der Heijde and colleagues in The Lancet1 shows that ixekizumab, a monoclonal antibody that selectively targets interleukin (IL)-17A, is efficacious in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (also known as radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) who have previously been untreated with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). Ixekizumab has already followed the other IL-17A antibody, secukinumab, in two other indications, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and it seems likely that an approval for radiographic axial spondyloarthritis will follow on the basis of the evidence provided in this Article.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Even the most colourless clinical description of schistosomiasis comes across like a pitch for an early David Lynch body horror. Waterborne flatworm larvae penetrate the skin, and move in the bloodstream through the heart and lungs to the liver. Here they mature and mate in the portal circulation, before laying eggs that lodge in the liver&#8212;occasionally the spinal cord or genitals&#8212;or leave the body via the bladder or intestinal walls. The framing of schistosomiasis as a parasitic tropical disease emerged from a series of global encounters&#8212;between medicine and science, between industrial nations competing for dominance, and between imperial governments and their indigenous subjects.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Frontal view gait recognition for people identification has been carried out using single RGB, stereo RGB, Kinect 1.0, and Doppler radar. However, existing methods based on these camera technologies suffer from several problems. Therefore, we propose a four-part method for frontal view gait recognition based on the fusion of multiple features acquired from a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera. We have developed a gait data set captured by a ToF camera. The data set includes two sessions recorded seven months apart, with 46 and 33 subjects, respectively, each with six walks with five covariates. The four-part method includes: a new human silhouette extraction algorithm that reduces the multiple reflection problem experienced by ToF cameras; a frame selection method based on a new gait cycle detection algorithm; four new gait image representations; and a novel fusion classifier. Rigorous experiments are carried out to compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art methods. The results show distinct improvements over recognition rates for all covariates. The proposed method outperforms all major existing approaches for all covariates and results in 66.1% and 81.0% Rank 1 and Rank 5 recognition rates, respectively, in overall covariates, compared with a best state-of-the-art method performance of 35.7% and 57.7%.

<p>A procedure to calculate maximum torque operating conditions for the inverter-fed induction machine is proposed in this paper. The proposed procedure minimizes the finite-element analysis computation load by identifying the variation range of stator current and slip frequency for the entire torque-speed map. Thus, the total calculation time for machine steady-state performance estimation can be significantly reduced. The effectiveness of the proposed procedure is validated by an experiment.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>A new light emitting diode (LED) driver circuit is presented in this paper based on the buck converter with coupled inductors for automotive applications. Soft-switching condition is provided for the switch via a passive resonant circuit incorporating the leakage inductance of the coupled inductors. Also, the leakage inductance energy is recycled to the output. The proposed converter has a very simple structure as well as high efficiency, which makes it a good candidate for battery-operated applications. The proposed converter only applies one magnetic element and the leakage and magnetizing inductances are used as resonant elements. Also, during the resonance, a resonance capacitor is approximately charged to the input voltage, and therefore, the capacitor voltage stress and semiconductor devices voltage stress are low. These are the main advantages of the proposed converter over other similar converters. The theoretical analysis is provided and the operating principles and design considerations are explained. An 8 W laboratory prototype is implemented in order to prove the validity of the theoretical analysis.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Resonant converters with capacitive output filters are quite popular for their higher voltage gain and compact designs. But the majority of the converters underutilize the transformer as they are subjected to discontinuous currents. This discontinuous current possesses huge current ripples that produce huge core losses and aggravate the temperature rise of the transformer. This often leads to saturation of the transformer. This paper presents an LCC-T resonant dc&#x2013;dc converter with a capacitive output filter operating all switches in the zero current switching (ZCS) switching mode and whose transformer current is a continuous sinusoidal with minimum stress on resonant tank components. This is achieved by bringing the transformer in series to a resonant inductor. The proposed converter is simulated in power simulation (PSIM) 11.0.1. A proof-of-concept model rated 288&#x00a0;W is designed and developed, and hardware results are presented as verification to theory.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In the near future, plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) will dominate the car market. The peak-valley difference would increase greatly due to the random nature of PEVs charging behaviors. In this paper, a new problem on studying the dynamic economic/emission dispatch (DEED) including PEVs for peak shaving and valley filling is proposed, and furthermore, the effect caused by different vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) loads on DEED is analyzed. The optimization model of the problem is constructed including several practical constraints, such as power flow constraints and ramp rate limits. The battery degradation cost is also included, which reshapes the objective function of DEED. Based on the model, a strategy for DEED including PEVs for peak shaving and valley filling is given, and a multiobjective optimization algorithm is adopted to solve the proposed problem. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy, three DEED cases are considered under different V2G power. The analysis of the effect on fuel cost and emission caused by different V2G power shows that the proposed strategy can effectively reduce the emission and cut down the investment in peak load plants.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper proposes a novel approach for detection of stator short-circuit faults in three-phase induction motors. The method is based on two stages: feature extraction and classification by intelligent systems. First, mutual information is estimated from delayed stator current signals, which are used as inputs of C4.5 decision trees and multilayer perceptron neural networks in the second step. Several offline and online experimental tests are presented considering voltage unbalance, load torque variations, and 1&#x0025; to 10&#x0025; short-circuit levels. The obtained results corroborate the effectiveness of this new diagnostic approach.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Lung cancer is the type of cancer that most often kills after the initial diagnosis. To aid the specialist in its diagnosis, temporal evaluation is a potential tool for analyzing indeterminate lesions, which may be benign or malignant, during treatment. With this goal in mind, a methodology is herein proposed for the analysis, quantification, and visualization of changes in lung lesions. This methodology uses a modified version of the quality threshold clustering algorithm to associate each voxel of the lesion to a cluster, and changes in the lesion over time are defined in terms of voxel moves to another cluster. In addition, statistical features are extracted for classification of the lesion as benign or malignant. To develop the proposed methodology, two databases of pulmonary lesions were used, one for malignant lesions in treatment (public) and the other for indeterminate cases (private). We determined that the density change percentage varied from 6.22&#x0025; to 36.93&#x0025; of lesion volume in the public database of malignant lesions under treatment and from 19.98&#x0025; to 38.81&#x0025; in the private database of lung nodules. Additionally, other inter-cluster density change measures were obtained. These measures indicate the degree of change in the clusters and how each of them is abundant in relation to volume. From the statistical analysis of regions in which the density changes occurred, we were able to discriminate lung lesions with an accuracy of 98.41&#x0025;, demonstrating that these changes can indicate the true nature of the lesion. In addition to visualizing the density changes occurring in lesions over time, we quantified these changes and analyzed the entire set through volumetry, which is the technique most commonly used to analyze changes in pulmonary lesions.

<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Metaheuristic techniques have shown remarkable performance in a vast variety of engineering problems. Accurate solving of nonlinear equation set in selective harmonic elimination (SHE) has been one of the widely discussed numerical problems in power electronics. Current study aims at conducting an inclusive comparison of prominent stochastic methods adopted for SHE and modified SHE (MSHE) pulse width modulation techniques. The problem is defined as finding local optima of cascaded H-bride converter operation parameters. The survey investigates key indices of low-order harmonic components and weighted total harmonic distortion. Floating fundamental component is introduced for SHE and MSHE to achieve higher rate of flexibility for optimization techniques. Finally, an advanced modulation technique is proposed to address the dc-link voltage ripples. Simulation and experimental results are presented as a proof of concept.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper investigates the peak-to-peak filtering problem for a class of networked nonlinear dc motor systems with quantization. The nonlinear dc motor system is modeled by a Takagi&#x2013;Sugeno (T&#x2013;S) fuzzy model. Consider that the measurement output signal and the performance output signal of the system are quantized by two static quantizers before being transmitted by the digital communication channel, respectively. Attention is focused on the design of a peak-to-peak filter such that the filtering error system is asymptotically stable and satisfies the prescribed peak-to-peak filtering performance index. Sufficient conditions for such a peak-to-peak filter are expressed in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, an illustrative simulation is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>To supporting the systematic requirements of higher spectrum efficiency and user deployment density in future Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), traditional orthogonal multiple access schemes, such as orthogonal frequency-division multiplex, are quite limiting. Nonorthogonal multiple access (NoMA) has been recognized as one of the enabling technologies for IIoT in 5G network. In this paper, we have proposed an alternative NoMA scheme called interleave-grid multiple access (IGMA). Depending on interleaving and grid-mapping process, IGMA is capable to provide reliable block error rate performance, marvelous user multiplexing capability, as well as robustness against intercell interference. IGMA can apply various detection and decoding techniques at receiver sides to improve the detection performance with acceptable complexity. Both of link-level and system-level results show the promising benefits of IGMA, in particular that nearly seven times user multiplexing gain compared with orthogonal frequency-division multiple access has been observed in the system-level simulation. In addition, a hardware test bed has been implemented to verify the IGMA performance and the testing results proved the strong competitiveness of IGMA over orthogonal frequency-division multiple access in terms of block error rate performance in user overloading scenarios.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Automotive cyber-physical systems are energy-aware and safety-critical systems where energy consumption should be controlled from a perspective of design constraints and reliability should be enhanced toward functional safety goal assurance. In this paper, we solve the problem of reliability enhancement of an automotive function (i.e., functionality or application) under energy and response-time constraints based on the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling technique. The problem is solved by a two-stage solution, namely, response-time reduction under energy constraint and reliability enhancement under energy and response-time constraints. The first stage is solved by proposing average energy preallocation, and the second stage is solved by proposing a reliability-enhancement technique based on the first stage. Examples and experiments show that the proposed solution can not only assure energy and response-time constraints, but also enhances reliability as much as 16.66&#x0025; compared with its counterpart.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Effectively monitoring maritime environments has become a vital problem in maritime applications. Traditional methods are not only expensive and time consuming but also restricted in both time and space. More recently, the concept of an industrial wireless sensor network (IWSN) has become a promising alternative for monitoring next-generation intelligent maritime grids, because IWSNs are cost-effective and easy to deploy. This paper focuses on solving the issue of 3-D IWSN deployment in a 3-D engine room space of a very large crude-oil carrier and also considers numerous power facilities. To address this 3-D IWSN deployment problem for maritime applications, a 3-D uncertain coverage model is proposed that uses a modified 3-D sensing model and an uncertain fusion operator. The deployment problem is converted into a multiobjective optimization problem that simultaneously addresses three objectives: coverage, lifetime, and reliability. Our goal is to achieve extensive coverage, long network lifetime, and high reliability. We also propose a distributed parallel cooperative coevolutionary multiobjective large-scale evolutionary algorithm for maritime applications. We verify the effectiveness of this algorithm through experiments by comparing it with five state-of-the-art algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method performs most effectively both in optimization performance and in minimizing the computation time.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Retrieving specific persons with various types of queries, e.g., a set of attributes or a portrait photo has great application potential in large-scale intelligent surveillance systems. In this paper, we propose a richly annotated pedestrian (RAP) dataset which serves as a unified benchmark for both attribute-based and image-based person retrieval in real surveillance scenarios. Typically, previous datasets have three improvable aspects, including limited data scale and annotation types, heterogeneous data source, and controlled scenarios. Differently, RAP is a large-scale dataset which contains 84928 images with 72 types of attributes and additional tags of viewpoint, occlusion, body parts, and 2589 person identities. It is collected in the real uncontrolled scene and has complex visual variations in pedestrian samples due to the change of viewpoints, pedestrian postures, and cloth appearance. Towards a high-quality person retrieval benchmark, an amount of state-of-the-art algorithms on pedestrian attribute recognition and person re-identification (ReID), are performed for quantitative analysis with three evaluation tasks, i.e., attribute recognition, attribute-based and image-based person retrieval, where a new instance-based metric is proposed to measure the dependency of the prediction of multiple attributes. Finally, some interesting problems, e.g., the joint feature learning of attribute recognition and ReID, and the problem of cross-day person ReID, are explored to show the challenges and future directions in person retrieval.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Depth information is being widely used in many real-world applications. However, due to the limitation of depth sensing technology, the captured depth map in practice usually has much lower resolution than that of color image counterpart. In this paper, we propose to combine the internal smoothness prior and external gradient consistency constraint in graph domain for depth super-resolution. On one hand, a new graph Laplacian regularizer is proposed to preserve the inherent piecewise smooth characteristic of depth, which has desirable filtering properties. A specific weight matrix of the respect graph is defined to make full use of information of both depth and the corresponding guidance image. On the other hand, inspired by an observation that the gradient of depth is small except at edge separating regions, we introduce a graph gradient consistency constraint to enforce that the graph gradient of depth is close to the thresholded gradient of guidance. We reinterpret the gradient thresholding model as variational optimization with sparsity constraint. In this way, we remedy the problem of structure discrepancy between depth and guidance. Finally, the internal and external regularizations are casted into a unified optimization framework, which can be efficiently addressed by ADMM. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art with respect to both objective and subjective quality evaluations.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Image annotation aims to annotate a given image with a variable number of class labels corresponding to diverse visual concepts. In this paper, we address two main issues in large-scale image annotation: 1) how to learn a rich feature representation suitable for predicting a diverse set of visual concepts ranging from object, scene to abstract concept and 2) how to annotate an image with the optimal number of class labels. To address the first issue, we propose a novel multi-scale deep model for extracting rich and discriminative features capable of representing a wide range of visual concepts. Specifically, a novel two-branch deep neural network architecture is proposed, which comprises a very deep main network branch and a companion feature fusion network branch designed for fusing the multi-scale features computed from the main branch. The deep model is also made multi-modal by taking noisy user-provided tags as model input to complement the image input. For tackling the second issue, we introduce a label quantity prediction auxiliary task to the main label prediction task to explicitly estimate the optimal label number for a given image. Extensive experiments are carried out on two large-scale image annotation benchmark datasets, and the results show that our method significantly outperforms the state of the art.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Random walk is a popular and efficient algorithm for image segmentation, especially for extracting regions of interest (ROIs). One difficulty with the random walk algorithm is the requirement for solving a huge sparse linear system when applied to large images. Another limitation is its sensitivity to seeds distribution, i.e., the segmentation result depends on the number of seeds as well as their placement, which puts a burden on users. In this paper, we first propose a continuous random walk model with explicit coherence regularization (CRWCR) for the extracted ROI, which helps to reduce the seeds sensitivity, so as to reduce the user interactions. Then, a very efficient algorithm to solve the CRWCR model will be developed, which helps to remove the difficulty of solving huge linear systems. Our algorithm consists of two stages: initialization by performing one-dimensional random walk sweeping based on user-provided seeds, followed by the alternating direction scheme, i.e., Peaceman&#x2013;Rachford scheme for further correction. The first stage aims to provide a good initial guess for the ROI, and it is very fast since we just solve a limited number of one-dimensional random walk problems. Then, this initial guess is evolved to the ideal solution by applying the second stage, which should also be very efficient since it fits well for GPU computing, and 10 iterations are usually sufficient for convergence. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the proposed model as well as the efficiency of the two-stage algorithm.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Garbled circuits are general tools that allow two parties to compute any function without disclosing their respective inputs. Applications of this technique vary from distributed privacy-preserving machine learning tasks to secure outsourced authentication. Unfortunately, the energy cost of garbled circuit evaluation protocols is substantial. This limits the applicability of garbled circuits in scenarios that involve battery-operated devices, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and smartphones. In this paper, we propose MEG, a Memory- and Energy-efficient Garbled circuit evaluation mechanism. MEG utilizes batch data transmission and multi-threading to reduce memory and energy consumption. We implement MEG on an Android smartphone and compare its performance and energy consumption with state-of-the-art techniques using two garbled circuits of widely different sizes (AES-128 and 256-bit edit distance). Our results show that, compared with &#x201c;plain&#x201d; garbled circuit evaluation, MEG decreases memory consumption by more than 90%. When compared with current pipelined garbled circuit evaluation techniques, MEG's energy usage was 42% lower for AES-128 and 23% lower for EDT-256. Furthermore, our multi-thread implementation of MEG decreased circuit evaluation time by up to 56.7% for AES-128, and by up to 13.5% for EDT-256, compared with state-of-the-art pipelining techniques.

</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>This paper introduces a new similarity measure, the covering similarity, which we formally define for evaluating the similarity between a symbolic sequence and a set of symbolic sequences. A pairwise similarity can also be directly derived from the covering similarity to compare two symbolic sequences. An efficient implementation to compute the covering similarity is proposed which uses a suffix-tree data structure, but other implementations, based on suffix array for instance, are possible and are possibly necessary for handling very large-scale problems. We have used this similarity to isolate attack sequences from normal sequences in the scope of host-based intrusion detection. We have assessed the covering similarity on two well-known benchmarks in the field. In view of the results reported on these two datasets for the state-of-the-art methods, according to the comparative study, we have carried out based on three challenging similarity measures commonly used for string processing, or in bioinformatics, we show that the covering similarity is particularly relevant to address the detection of anomalies in sequences of system calls.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>Due to its cost efficiency, the controller area network (CAN) is still the most wide-spread in-vehicle bus, and the numerous reported attacks demonstrate the urgency in designing new security solutions for CAN. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection mechanism that takes advantage of Bloom filtering to test frame periodicity based on message identifiers and parts of the data-field which facilitates detection of potential replay or modification attacks. This proves to be an effective approach since most of the traffic from in-vehicle buses is cyclic in nature and the format of the data-field is fixed due to rigid signal allocation. Bloom filters provide an efficient time-memory tradeoff which is beneficial for the constrained resources of automotive grade controllers. We test the correctness of our approach and obtain good results on an industry-standard CANoe-based simulation for a J1939 commercial-vehicle bus and also on CAN with flexible data-rate traces obtained from a real-world high-end vehicle. The proposed filtering mechanism is straightforward to adapt for any other time-triggered in-vehicle bus, e.g., FlexRay, since it is built on time-driven characteristics.

<span class="itemfrom">[<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - new TOC</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="itemdescription">
<p>In this paper, we consider user scheduling and power allocation techniques for downlinks where transmitted message must be kept confidential from all other unintended users and the number of users is larger than that of access point (AP) antennas. In order to maximize network secrecy rate with a limited number of antennas, the AP schedules a user who can achieve the largest secrecy rate and exploits multiple antennas for transmitting artificial noise to the unintended users. We derive the closed-form expressions of the optimal power allocation for the artificial noise and the average network secrecy rate through asymptotic analysis. The analysis results provide the insightful information on the behaviors of the user scheduling and the effect of system parameters on the network secrecy rate performance. It is shown that opportunistic scheduling with artificial noise transmission technique is more effective than the conventional precoding techniques for multiple confidential message transmissions in terms of network secrecy rate. Furthermore, we have also discussed a transmission strategy for the worst case scenarios where all unintended users are treated as colluding eavesdroppers. The simulations confirm the validity of the analysis results and provide additional information on the network performance in general cases.
